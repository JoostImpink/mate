(ii) in the case of each share of levco common stock owned of record by levin immediately prior to the effective time, the number of shares of bkf common stock equal to the result (rounded to the nearest hundredth share) obtained through application of the following formula: $62,750,000 - ((auma + te + pc) x 0.85) + cg -------------------------------------------- $15.80 (the "second fraction") / 7,000 where auma, te and pc have the same meanings as set forth in subparagraph (i) of this section 2.1(a) and cg means the product of (x) the capital gains distributions and (y) the second fraction (assuming cg equals zero); plus, an amount in cash equal to the result (rounded to the nearest penny) obtained through application of the following formula: ($17,750,000 + ((auma + te + pc) x 0.15)) / 7,000 where auma, te and pc have the same meaning as set forth in subparagraph (i) above of this section 2.1(a). for avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the aggregate number of shares of levco common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time be converted in the merger into the right to receive more than an aggregate of $35,000,000 in cash and (i) a number of shares of bkf common stock having an aggregate dollar value at a price of $15.80 per share equal to $80,000,000 minus the aggregate dollar amount of (x) the assets under management adjustment amount (if any), (y) the transaction expenses (if any) and (z) the partnership capital (such number of shares, the "full shares") plus (ii) such additional number of shares of bkf common stock equal to the result obtained by multiplying the full shares times the capital gains distributions and dividing such result by $15.80. (b) the dollar amounts to be applied in the formulas set forth in section 2.1(a) shall be determined in accordance with this section 2.1(b): 4 (i) (a) for purposes of this agreement, "assets under management" means (x) the assets under levco's management as investment adviser that are the subject of an investment contract (as hereinafter defined), whether written or oral, between levco and a client (as defined in section 6.20) of levco, but such assets shall not at any time include any assets under levco's management wherein the client is, or that are beneficially owned (as such term is defined in rule 13d-3 under the exchange act) by, a stockholder or a related person (as hereinafter defined) of a stockholder and (y) the portfolio assets of each investment partnership. a "related person" of a stockholder means (i) any of the descendants or spouses of descendants of a great-grandfather of such stockholder or of such stockholder's spouse (any person having such a relationship being herein referred to as a "family member") or any trust primarily for the benefit of such stockholder and/or any one or more family members of such stockholder (a "family trust") or (ii) any partnership, corporation or other form of business or investment entity or association (any of the foregoing, an "enterprise") directly or indirectly controlled by such stockholder or any family member or family trust of such stockholder; provided, however, that in no event shall a related person of levin be deemed a related person of any stockholder. for purposes of this agreement, a person (as hereinafter defined) is "affiliated with" another person if it, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such other person; and "control" when used with respect to a specified person, means the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise; and the terms "controlled" and "controlling" have meanings correlative with the foregoing.

(c) for purposes hereof, an "agreed consent" shall be deemed to have been given with respect to an investment contract included in the closing assets under management if: (x) in the case of any investment contract in existence at the base date with a client that is an institutional investor or an individual investor whose assets under management by levco exceed $500,000 as of the date a consent is first solicited from such client or the affirmative consent of whom is required under the terms of the investment contract with such client, a written consent to the assignment of such investment contract to the surviving corporation, and, upon the contribution, to the investment adviser subsidiary has been obtained from the client or the client has entered into a new written investment contract with the investment adviser subsidiary, in either case on terms not less favorable to the investment adviser subsidiary than the original investment contract was to levco (provided that such investment contract will be deemed to be on terms not less favorable to the investment adviser subsidiary than the original investment contract was to levco if it provides for break points in the fee schedule comparable to the break points being offered by levco to clients with comparable assets under 6 management prior to the date of this agreement), (y) in the case of any investment contract in existence at the base date with a client who is an individual investor whose assets under management by levco are $500,000 or less as of the date a notice of the type referred to below is first given to such client and whose affirmative consent is not required under the applicable terms of the investment contract with such client, the client has been given at least twenty trading days prior notice of the proposed assignment of such client's investment contract in accordance with the terms of this agreement and has not objected to the assignment of such investment contract or indicated his or her intent to terminate such investment contract, and (z) in the case of any investment contract entered into after the base date, such investment contract is on terms not materially different than those of investment contracts in existence immediately prior to the date of this agreement for accounts of a similar size and with similar investment objectives (or if such terms are different, contains terms which levco can reasonably demonstrate are no less favorable to levco than those being offered to the public by levco's competitors with comparable performance records and experience in the investment management business to accounts of a similar size and with similar investment objectives), and such investment contract contains as a specific term thereof a consent to the assignment of such investment contract to the surviving corporation, and upon the contribution, to the investment adviser subsidiary. an "agreed consent" shall be deemed to have been given with respect to (x) the account of any partner in any investment partnership if such partner shall have consented to the transactions contemplated by schedule 9.1(c) with respect to such investment partnership and shall not on the closing date have withdrawn or indicated its intention to withdraw as a partner in the investment partnership except as contemplated by schedule 9.1(c), and (y) the account of any partner whose capital is required to be withdrawn from the partnership as a result of the occurrence of an l.p. bifurcation event. (ii) not later than the second trading day prior to the closing, the stockholders shall obtain from their legal counsel, accountants or other third party consultants to whom or which they are or will be obligated to pay fees and expenses with respect to the transactions contemplated by this agreement (the "transaction advisers"), except goldman, sachs & co. and any persons providing services to goldman sachs & co., including its counsel, a statement (which shall be final and binding as against bkf and the surviving corporation) of each transaction adviser's professional fees and expenses (including disbursements) for the transactions contemplated by this agreement. the aggregate dollar amount of such statements shall be the "transaction expenses." (iii) as of the close of business on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date, levco shall determine the dollar amount of the minimum general partner capital contributions that are required to have been made as of such time with respect to each investment partnership (as hereinafter 7 defined) in order to comply with revenue procedure 89-12 of the internal revenue service (or any successor law, regulation or revenue procedure thereto), and the stockholders shall certify such amount to bkf, which certification shall set forth in reasonable detail the manner of determining such amount for each investment partnership. the aggregate dollar amount of such minimum general partner capital contributions shall be the "partnership capital" for all purposes of this agreement. the total number of shares of bkf common stock to be issued in the merger determined pursuant to section 2.1(a) are referred to herein as the "merger shares," the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in the merger (except fractional share payments, as hereinafter defined) determined pursuant to section 2.1(a) is referred to herein as the "cash consideration" and the merger shares and the cash consideration payable in the merger are together referred to herein as the "merger consideration." as used in this agreement, the merger value means the sum of the cash consideration plus the numerator of the fraction set forth in section 2.1(a)(i) and the numerator of the second fraction set forth in section 2.1(a)(ii). any shares of levco common stock held in the treasury of levco immediately prior to the effective time shall, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled without consideration and be retired and cease to exist. (b) at the effective time each share of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of merger subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into and shall become one share of common stock of the surviving corporation and each certificate heretofore representing any such shares shall, after the effective time and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed to represent the same number of shares of the surviving corporation. (c) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of bkf common stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates of levco common stock; no stock split or dividend with respect to shares of bkf common stock shall relate to any fractional share interest, and no such fractional share interest will entitle the owner thereof to vote as, or to any other rights of, a stockholder of bkf. in lieu of such fractional shares, any holder of levco common stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of bkf common stock will, upon surrender of his certificate to bkf in accordance with section 2.2, be entitled to receive cash (a "fractional share payment") in an amount determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of bkf common stock on the new york stock exchange composite tape, as reported in the wall street journal (midwest edition) on the trading day immediately preceding the closing and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent. the fractional share interests of each stockholder shall be aggregated, so that no stockholder shall receive a fractional share payment in an amount greater than the value of one full share of bkf common stock (determined as provided in the preceding sentence). no interest shall accrue or be paid with respect to fractional share interests with respect to cash payable in lieu of fractional share interests. 8 2.2 exchange of shares. at the closing, merger subsidiary shall, upon receipt from each of the stockholders of a certificate or certificates representing the issued and outstanding shares of levco common stock owned by such stockholder (collectively, the "certificates" and individually, a "certificate"), deliver to such stockholder a certificate or certificates representing the merger shares such stockholder is entitled to receive determined in accordance with section 2.1(a) hereof, together with any cash consideration and fractional share payment payable in respect of such shares of levco common stock as provided in section 2.1(a) and 2.1(c), respectively. as of the effective time, each certificate that prior to the effective time represented shares of levco common stock shall be deemed for all corporate purposes (including voting rights) to evidence the merger consideration to be delivered in exchange therefor under the terms of this agreement. no transfer taxes shall be payable by the stockholders in connection with their receipt of the merger shares, except that if any certificate for the merger shares is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the stockholder surrendering such certificate shall pay to bkf any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of such merger shares in any name other than that of such stockholder, or establish to the satisfaction of bkf that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. if any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, such certificate shall be deemed to have been surrendered properly to bkf for all purposes of this section 2.2 if the stockholder owning such certificate shall have delivered to bkf a sworn affidavit as to such claim (and, if required in the sole discretion of bkf, a bond in such form and amount, and with such surety, sufficient to indemnify bkf against such claim). 2.3 closing of transfer books. at the effective time,

(b) for a period of forty-five (45) days after the delivery of the notice specified above, the stockholder representative shall be entitled to object in a written statement to the claim or claims made in the officer's certificate. if the stockholder representative shall so object in writing to any claim or claims by bkf made in any officer's certificate, bkf shall have forty- five (45) days to respond in a written statement to the objection of the stockholder representative. if after such forty-five (45) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the stockholder representative and bkf shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. if the stockholder representative and bkf fail to reach agreement during such sixty (60) day period, either bkf or the stockholder representative may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in a pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by an arbitrator to be selected in accordance with the following sentence. within fifteen (15) days after such written notice demanding arbitration is sent, bkf and the stockholder representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator which shall be the arbitrator (the "arbitrator") for all purposes of this agreement. the decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any claim in such 71 officer's certificate shall be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto; provided, however, that regardless of such decision or award the amount of indemnification owed to bkf shall be subject to the limitations contained in section 12.5. (c) judgment upon any award by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. any such arbitration shall be held (i) in the case of the first such arbitration, in chicago, illinois, (ii) in the case of the second such arbitration, in new york, new york and (iii) in each subsequent arbitration, in one of such jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the immediately preceding arbitration was held, under the commercial rules then in effect of the american arbitration association. each party to an arbitration conducted hereunder shall pay its own expenses, including legal fees, and the fees of the arbitrator and the administrative fee, if any, of the american arbitration association, shall in each case, be borne 50/50 by bkf, on the one hand, and the stockholder or stockholders, as the case may be, that is the subject of such arbitration, on the other hand. (d) notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event bkf shall have delivered an officer's certificate under the escrow agreement with respect to any losses, and insufficient escrow shares are available in the escrow fund to satisfy the claim relating thereto, the validity and amount of which has been determined and awarded by the arbitrator selected pursuant to, and as defined in the escrow agreement, then the parties shall not be required to separately observe the provisions of this section 12.8 with respect to such losses, other than the proviso to section 12.8(b). article xiii other covenants 13.1 employment of levco's employees. surviving corporation shall offer continued employment on and after the closing date to all employees of levco who were such immediately prior to the closing date (the "continued employees"). nothing contained herein shall be construed to modify the "at will" employee status of those of levco's employees who are immediately prior to the closing "at will" employees, and surviving corporation shall retain the absolute right to terminate such continued employees at any time and for any reason or no reason on or after the closing date, subject to the arrangements contemplated in the employment agreements contemplated by section 10.2(d). surviving corporation and each stockholder who is not a party to the employment agreements contemplated by section 10.2(d) will enter into a one-year employment agreement in substantially the form of exhibit 13.1 hereto, if such stockholder remains an employee of levco at the closing. 13.2 confidentiality each of levco and the stockholders, on behalf of themselves and in the case of levco, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisers, agree to keep confidential any and all information and data of a proprietary or confidential nature with respect to bkf and its subsidiaries and affiliates which any of them has received as a result of any investigation made in connection with this agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing covenant shall not apply to any such information or data to the extent disclosure thereof is required by applicable law, order, rule or regulation. 72 13.3 tax matters. the stockholders and bkf agree to report the merger as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the code for federal, state and local income tax purposes. the stockholders and bkf agree to file, and to cause levco to file, all income tax returns affected by, or required or permitted to include, the transactions contemplated by this agreement in a manner consistent with the treatment described in the preceding sentence. bkf shall not take, or permit the levco companies to take, and the stockholders shall not take, any action after closing that would itself (without regard to any action taken by levco or the stockholders prior to the effective time) disqualify the merger as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the code. article xiv guarantees; stockholder representative 14.1 guarantees. bkf hereby guarantees for the benefit of levco and the stockholders the performance by merger subsidiary of all of its obligations under this agreement and each related agreement executed and delivered by merger subsidiary. the stockholders, jointly and severally, hereby guarantee for the benefit of bkf the performance by levco of all of its obligations under this agreement and each related agreement executed and delivered by levco, which in no event shall be deemed to include any obligations of the levco companies from and after the consummation of the merger. 14.2 stockholder representative.

only for such purpose. 2. holding and accounting for shares. --------------------------------- (a) each stockholder shall deliver to the escrow agent his or her respective designated shares, and such designated shares shall be reregistered in the name of the escrow agent and the escrow agent shall hold and maintain such designated shares, as escrow agent, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement in a separate account (such account, the "designated account"). (b) notwithstanding section 2(a) hereof, during the escrow period (as hereinafter defined) each stockholder shall retain the right to exercise and shall be entitled to exercise, in person or by its nominee or proxy, any and all rights and powers to vote his or her designated shares and to take part in or give consent with respect to any corporate action with respect to which such shares are able or required to be voted. bkf shall cause the escrow agent to, and the escrow agent shall, promptly notify each stockholder upon the receipt of any proxy, similar solicitation material or any shareholder communication, and bkf shall cause the escrow agent to, and the escrow agent shall, promptly (but in no case later than the third business day (as hereinafter defined) following receipt) deliver such materials to each stockholder. the escrow agent shall vote all proxies solicited with respect to each stockholder's designated shares only in accordance with the written instructions of such stockholder (or his or her nominee or proxy, but only if accompanied by written instrument evidencing such nomination or proxy) or if no such written instructions are received by the escrow agent by the close of business on the 10th business day immediately following the date on which such proxies were sent to such stockholder, then, in accordance with the written instructions of john a. levin (if any). the escrow agent shall have no right to, and shall not, vote any of the escrow shares other than in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. as used herein, "business day" means any day (other than a saturday, sunday or holiday) on which banks are open for business in kansas city, missouri or such other city in which the escrow agent principally performs its escrow administration functions, as notified by the escrow agent to bkf and the stockholder representative in writing from time to time. (c) notwithstanding section 2(a) hereof, during the escrow period, each stockholder shall retain the right to receive and shall be entitled to receive any and all dividends, capital gains and other distributions paid or declared with respect to such stockholder's designated shares and the escrow agent shall promptly (but in no event later than the third business day following receipt by it) deliver by wire transfer to such stockholder all such dividends, capital gains and other distributions pursuant to wire instructions set forth on schedule 2(c) hereto or such other written instructions as may be provided by such stockholder from time to time at least three business days prior to the date such payment is to be made to the stockholder. (d) notwithstanding section 2(a) hereof, from time to time during the escrow period, each stockholder shall have the right to transfer all or a portion of its designated shares to any one or more other stockholders; provided, however, that, after giving effect to all transfers pursuant to this clause (d), no stockholder shall have fewer designated shares as a result of a transfer pursuant hereto than such stockholder had immediately prior to such transfer. if any -2- stockholder (the "transferring stockholder") elects to so transfer any number of its designated shares (the "transferred number") to any other stockholder (the "transferee"), it shall so notify the escrow agent and bkf in writing (a transfer notice") and within two business days of receipt of the transfer notice, (i) bkf shall, if so directed by the transferring stockholder, (a) issue to such transferring stockholder stock certificates representing such number of designated shares as such transferring stockholder may request in order to allow the transfer of the transferred number of designated shares and (b) immediately thereafter, cause such newly issued certificates to be reregistered in the name of the escrow agent and (ii) the escrow agent shall (a) upon receipt of such newly issued certificates, return to bkf for cancellation the certificates theretofore representing such transferring stockholder's designated shares and (b) cause the transferred number of such transferring stockholder's designated shares to be transferred from the transferring stockholder's designated account to the transferee's designated account. upon any such transfer, schedule 1 hereto shall be amended accordingly. 3. determination of losses. ----------------------- (a) upon receipt by the escrow agent on or before the last day of the escrow period of a certificate signed by any officer of bkf, other than the stockholder representative (an "officer's certificate"), (i) stating that losses exist in an aggregate amount greater than the relevant indemnification basket or that no indemnification basket is applicable to such losses and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail (a) the individual items of such losses included in the amount so stated, (b) in the case of losses arising out of any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty contained in article v of the merger agreement ("several losses"), the stockholder against whom indemnification therefor is claimed (each such stockholder, the "indemnifying stockholder"), (c) the portion of such losses constituting several losses, if any, and the portion of such several losses to be paid by such indemnifying stockholder, (d) the portion of such losses not constituting several losses, if any ("joint losses), (e) the date each such item of loss was paid, incurred or sustained and (f) the nature of the misrepresentations, breach of warranty or claim to which such item is related, the escrow agent shall, subject to the provisions of section 3(c) hereunder, deliver to bkf (x) in the case of several losses out of such indemnifying stockholder's designated account, as promptly as practicable, an aggregate number of shares of bkf common stock equal to the quotient of (a) the dollar amount of such several losses and (b) $15.80 minus the per share amount of any capital gains distribution on the escrow shares for which the record date has occurred from the closing date through the date such escrow shares are paid to bkf hereunder, in each case adjusted for any stock dividends on or stock splits or combinations of the bkf common stock (such difference, the "deemed value") and (y) in the case of joint losses, out of each stockholder's designated account, as promptly as practicable, an aggregate number of bkf common shares equal to the result of the following formula -3- l x ds -- -- dv es where: l = the aggregate dollar amount of the joint losses claimed in such officer's certificate; dv = the deemed value; ds = such stockholder's designated shares remaining in his or her designated account at the time of payment of such joint losses to bkf; and es = the aggregate remaining escrow shares at the time of payment of such joint losses to bkf; (the calculation of the number of shares of bkf common stock to be paid to bkf out of each stockholder's designated shares pursuant to clause (x) or (y), as applicable, is herein called a "share delivery calculation"). prior to any payment by the escrow agent under this section 3(a), bkf shall deliver to the escrow agent an officer's certificate setting forth the share delivery calculation. (b) [intentionally omitted.] (c) at the time of delivery of any officer's certificate to the escrow agent, a duplicate copy of such officer's certificate shall be delivered to the stockholder representative and for a period of forty-five (45) days after receipt of such officer's certificate by the escrow agent, the escrow agent shall make no delivery of bkf common stock unless the escrow agent shall have received written authorization from the stockholder representative to make such delivery. after the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, if such officer's certificate shall not have been withdrawn by bkf, the escrow agent shall make delivery of bkf common stock from each indemnifying stockholder's designated account in an amount determined in accordance with the applicable share delivery calculation, provided that no such delivery may be made if the stockholder representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made, or calculation set forth, in an officer's certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the escrow agent and to bkf and received by each such party prior to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period. (d) in case the stockholder representative shall so object in writing to any claim or claims by bkf made in any officer's certificate, bkf shall have forty-five (45) days after the date of receipt by the escrow agent of such written objection to respond in a written statement to the objection of the stockholder representative. if after such forty-five (45) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims or calculations set forth, the stockholder representative and bkf shall attempt in good faith during the sixty (60) day period thereafter to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. if the -4- stockholder representative and bkf should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the escrow agent. the escrow agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and, if required by the terms of such memorandum, shall distribute bkf common stock from each indemnifying stockholder's designated account in accordance with the terms thereof and the applicable share delivery calculation. the resolution set forth in any such memorandum shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto with respect to the matters covered therein. (e) if no such agreement has been reached after such 60-day period, either bkf or the stockholder representative may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by an arbitrator to be selected in accordance with the following sentence. within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is sent, bkf and the stockholder representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator which shall be the arbitrator (the "arbitrator") for all purposes of this agreement. the decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any losses claimed in such officer's certificate or the share delivery calculation, if applicable, shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this agreement, and the escrow agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the escrow fund in accordance therewith and the applicable share delivery calculation; provided, however, that such decision shall be delivered to the escrow agent in writing evidencing the appointment of the arbitrator. (f) judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. any such arbitration shall be held (i) in the case of the first such arbitration, in chicago, illinois, (ii) in the case of the second such arbitration, in new york, new york and (iii) in each subsequent arbitration, in one of such jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the immediately preceding arbitration was held, under the commercial rules then in effect of the american arbitration association. each party to an arbitration conducted hereunder shall pay its own expenses, including legal fees, and the fees of the arbitrator and the administrative fee, if any, of the american arbitration association, shall, in each case, be borne 50/50 by bkf, on one hand, and the stockholder or stockholders, as the case may be, subject to such arbitration, on the other hand. 4. termination of escrow period. ---------------------------- (a) the term (the "escrow period") of the escrow fund created hereunder shall commence on the date hereof and shall terminate on the third anniversary of the closing date; provided, however, that the number of designated shares in each designated account, which, in the reasonable judgment of bkf, subject to the objection of the stockholder representative and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in this agreement, are necessary to satisfy (in accordance with the applicable share delivery calculations) any unsatisfied claims specified in any officer's certificate delivered to the escrow agent prior to termination of the escrow period with respect to facts and circumstances -5- existing prior to expiration of the escrow period, shall remain in the escrow fund until such claims have been resolved in accordance herewith at which time all escrow shares remaining in the escrow fund shall be delivered to the stockholders in accordance with section 4(b). (b) subject to the proviso set forth in section 4(a) above, bkf agrees to instruct the escrow agent to deliver to each stockholder upon the termination of the escrow period the designated shares then remaining in such stockholder's designated account. 5. duties and responsibilities of escrow agent. ------------------------------------------- (a) the escrow agent, by signing this agreement, agrees to hold and dispose of the escrow shares in accordance with the terms hereof. the duties and responsibilities of the escrow agent shall be limited to those expressly set forth in this agreement and it shall not be subject to, nor obligated to recognize, any other agreement between, or direction or instruction of, any or all of the parties hereto even though reference thereto may be made therein; provided, however, with the written consent of the escrow agent, this agreement may be amended at any time or times by an instrument in writing signed by the stockholder representative and bkf.

(c) the escrow agent shall not be personally liable for any act taken or omitted hereunder if taken or omitted by it in good faith and in the exercise of its own best judgment and bkf and the stockholders, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and save the escrow agent, in its capacity as such, harmless from all loss, cost, damages, fees and expenses, including, but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees (collectively, "escrow agreement losses") suffered or incurred by the escrow agent as a result thereof; provided, however, that the escrow agent shall be liable for, and shall not be entitled to indemnification in respect of, any escrow agreement losses arising out of its fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct under this agreement. the escrow agent shall also be fully protected in relying upon any written notice, demand, certificate, waiver, authorization, memorandum, request, letter, -6- opinion, power of attorney or any other document delivered to it pursuant to the terms of this agreement which it in good faith believes to be genuine.

(e) in the event of any disagreement between the undersigned or the person or persons named in the instructions delivered pursuant to this agreement or with any other persons resulting in adverse claims and demands being made in connection with or for any papers, money or property involved herein, or affected hereby, the escrow agent shall be entitled to refuse to comply with any demand or claim, as long as such disagreement shall continue, and in so refusing to make any delivery or other disposition of any money, papers or property involved or affected hereby, the escrow agent shall not be or become liable to the undersigned or to any person named in such instructions for its refusal to comply with such conflicting or adverse demands, and the escrow agent shall be entitled to refuse and refrain to act until: (i) the rights of the adverse claimants shall have been fully and finally adjudicated in a court assuming and having jurisdiction of the parties and money, papers and property involved herein or affected hereby; (ii) all differences shall have been resolved by agreement and the escrow agent shall have been notified thereof in writing, signed by all the interested parties; or (iii) the arbitrator shall render a decision pursuant to section 3(e) hereof. (f) the escrow agent may consult with legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no

representative and bkf. if the escrow agent has not received a designation of a successor escrow agent at the end of such thirty (30) day period, the escrow agent's sole responsibility after such time shall be to safekeep the escrow fund until receipt of a designation of successor escrow agent or a joint written disposition instruction by the other parties hereto or a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 8. termination of the escrow agent. bkf and the stockholder representative may jointly terminate the appointment of the escrow agent hereunder by written instructions signed by

("merger subsidiary") and john a. levin & co., inc. ("levco") and all of the holders of the outstanding capital stock of levco have consummated transactions pursuant to an amended and restated agreement and plan of merger dated as of may 13, 1996 (the "merger agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, levco has been merged with and into merger subsidiary and the shares of common stock of levco have been converted into cash and shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of bkf ("bkf common stock"); and whereas, bkf and the investors desire to set forth certain registration rights with respect to the bkf common stock received by them pursuant to the merger agreement; and whereas, the execution and delivery of this agreement by bkf and the investors is an express condition precedent under the merger agreement, and bkf and levin are executing and delivering this agreement in satisfaction of such condition precedent; now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows: section 1. demand registrations. -------------------- (a) demand registrations. subject to the terms set forth herein, at any time following the holding period (as hereinafter defined), upon the written request of levin that bkf effect the registration of up to the registrable amount of registrable securities held by him as of the closing date (as such terms are hereinafter defined), under the securities act of 1933, as amended, (the "1933 act") and specifying the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, bkf shall promptly send written notice of such requested registration to all other investors. within five (5) days after receipt of such notice, any investor may notify bkf in writing of his or her request to have up to the registrable amount of registrable securities held by such investor as of the closing date included in such registration (each such other investor so notifying bkf of such a request, a "participating stockholder"). thereupon bkf shall effect the registration (the "demand registration") under the 1933 act of all registrable securities requested to be registered by levin and each participating stockholder (collectively, the "selling stockholders") to the extent required to permit the disposition in accordance with the requested method thereof and in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 2; provided that upon at least two business days notice prior to the effective date of any registration statement (as defined below) filed in connection with such registration, each participating stockholder shall have the right to withdraw his or her request to have its registrable securities included in such registration statement; provided, further, that if the managing underwriter (selected by levin in accordance with subsection (b) hereof) of any underwritten offering subject to this section 1 shall inform bkf, levin and the participating stockholders that, in its reasonable opinion, the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the participating stockholders would adversely effect such offering, then the managing underwriter of such offering shall limit the number of registrable securities included in such offering so as to eliminate such adverse effect by reducing the number of registrable securities to be included by the participating stockholders on a pro rata basis (measured by a fraction of the numerator of which is the number of registrable securities that a participating stockholder requested to be included in the registration and the denominator of which is the total number of registrable securities requested to be included by all participating stockholders); provided, further, that if the managing underwriter eliminated all registrable securities requested to be included in such offering by the participating stockholders and, in its reasonable opinion, the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by levin would adversely affect such offering, the managing underwriter shall limit the number of registrable securities included in such offering so as to eliminate such adverse effect by reducing the number of registrable securities intended to be included by levin. notwithstanding the foregoing, bkf shall not be required to take action to effect the registration of registrable securities pursuant to this section 1, if: (i) bkf has effected a demand registration during the prior 365 day period; (ii) bkf has effected three (3) registrations pursuant to section 1 hereof; or (iii) bkf shall have notified levin in writing that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of bkf it would not be in the best interests of bkf or its stockholders for a registration statement to be filed or declared effective in the near future; provided that, bkf's obligation hereunder to effect such demand registration shall not be deferred for a period in excess of two months. (b) underwritten offerings. whenever a registration requested pursuant to section 1 contemplates an underwritten offering, (i) only registrable securities designated by levin and the participating stockholders in their sole discretion may be included in such underwriting agreement relating to such offering, unless levin shall have permitted (in writing) other securities to be included in such registration and such underwritten offering and (ii) levin shall have the right to select the managing underwriter(s) to administer the offering, from a list of five nationally prominent investment banking firms named by bkf as reasonably acceptable to it and delivered to levin. 2 (c) withdrawal. if, at any time after requesting registration pursuant to this section 1 and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration request, levin shall determine for any reason not to register such registrable securities, levin may, by giving written notice to bkf, withdraw his request for such registration (which election of withdrawal shall be binding upon, and shall be deemed to have been made by, each participating stockholder), provided, however, that such withdrawal will decrease by one the number of demands available to levin hereunder. after such withdrawal by levin, bkf shall be relieved of its obligations to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration request by levin (including those of the participating stockholders). (d) piggy back rights. if bkf proposes to file a registration statement under the 1933 act with respect to an offering by bkf of bkf common stock (an "offering") (other than an offering in connection with an acquisition by bkf, pursuant to an offering by bkf to its existing shareholders of rights to acquire bkf common stock, or for the purpose of registering bkf common stock to be issued under bkf's dividend or capital gains reinvestment plan or any employee benefit plan (a "permitted offering")), then bkf shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the investors at least fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated filing date, and such notice shall offer each investor the opportunity to register all of the registrable securities held by the investor as of the closing date on the same terms and conditions as similar securities included therein. upon the written request of investors made within five (5) days after notice is given by bkf (such investor notice specifying the number of registrable securities sought to be sold by each such investor), bkf will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of the registrable shares which bkf has been so requested by the investors to register. the failure by an investor to advise bkf in writing of his or her election to participate in such registration within the five (5) day period shall constitute an election not to register or participate, without prejudice to the investor's right to participate in subsequent registrations or offerings or to demand or participate, as the case may be, in a registration pursuant to section 1. if requested by the underwriters for such offering, the investors on whose behalf registrable securities are to be distributed shall enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters, such agreement to contain such representations and warranties by the investors participating in the offering and such other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements for secondary offerings, including, without limitation, indemnities substantially to the effect and to the extent provided in section 4(b) hereof; provided that the investors participating in the offering shall reasonably cooperate with bkf in the negotiation of the underwriting agreement. if bkf and the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering determine that the inclusion of the registrable securities and any other shares of bkf common stock as to which the holders ("other holders") shall have registration rights in such registration would be harmful to the prospects of a successful offering of the securities being offered in such registration, then the amount of securities to be offered for the account of each of the investors and the other holders shall be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares of bkf common stock held by each investor and other holder to the amount necessary to reduce the total amount of securities to be included in the offering to the amount which would not be harmful to the prospects of a successful offering as recommended in good faith by bkf. any such determination will be set forth in a certificate of an executive officer of bkf or a certificate of 3 such managing underwriter delivered to the investors requesting to participate in the offering, which certificate will set forth the number of shares of bkf common stock held by the investor which will be included in the offering. if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement, bkf shall determine for any reason either not to register or to delay registration of such securities, bkf may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each holder of registrable securities and thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to register any registrable securities in connection with such offering (but not from its obligation to pay the registration expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any investor under section 1 hereto, and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any registrable securities, for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities in the offering. (e) certain definitions. ------------------- (i) terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the respective meaning ascribed thereto in the merger agreement. (ii) holding period. "holding period" shall mean the time period beginning on the closing date and ending 365 days thereafter. (iii) registrable amount.

(iv) registrable securities. "registrable securities" shall mean those shares of bkf common stock issued to the investors pursuant to the merger agreement. as to any particular registrable securities, such securities will cease to be registrable securities when they have been distributed to the public pursuant to a offering registered under the 1933 act or sold to the public through a broker, dealer or market maker in compliance with rule 144 under the 1933 act (or any similar rule then in force) (v) registration expenses. "registration expenses" means all expenses incident to bkf and bkf's performance of or compliance with sections 1 and 2, including, without limitation, all registration, filing, nyse listing and nasd fees, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or "blue sky" laws (including fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with "blue sky" qualifications of registrable securities), all word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses incurred by bkf, the fees and disbursements of counsel for bkf (but not for the selling stockholders) and of its independent, public accountants, including the expenses of "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance, the fees and expenses of any special experts retained by bkf in connection with a registration and any fees and disbursements of underwriters customarily paid by issuers of securities and to which bkf and the underwriter have separately agreed in bkf's sole discretion; provided, that, in no event shall "registration 4 expenses" include any underwriting discounts or commissions and transfer taxes with respect to the registrable securities or any fees, expenses and disbursements of the investors' legal counsel and accountants.

(b) investor expenses. with respect to all demand registrations under this agreement, the selling stockholders will bear pro-rata (measured by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of registrable securities sold in an underwritten offering by each selling stockholder and the denominator of which is the number of registrable securities sold by all selling stockholders) all underwriting discounts and commissions, if any, and will bear, severally, the fees, expenses and disbursements of their own legal counsel and accountants. with respect to the third demand registration under this agreement, the selling stockholders will also bear pro-rata all registration expenses (other than the fees and disbursements of counsel to bkf and of bkf's independent public accountants), and shall bear, severally, the fees, expenses and disbursements of their own legal counsel and accountants. 7 section 4. indemnification --------------- (a) bkf agrees to, and does hereby, indemnify and hold harmless to the extent permitted by law, each selling stockholder and each other person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 act, and their respective directors, officers, partners, employees and affiliates (each a "seller indemnified party"), against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such seller indemnified party may become subject under the 1933 act or otherwise, and to reimburse each seller indemnified party for any legal or any other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding, insofar as such losses, claims, damages , liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arising out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement, or alleged untrue statement, of a material fact contained in or incorporated by reference in the registration statement, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any post-effective amendment thereof, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement, or alleged untrue statement, of a material fact contained or incorporated by reference in any preliminary prospectus or statement of additional information, if used prior to the effective date of a registration statement, or contained or incorporated by reference in the final prospectus or statement of additional information if used within the registration term, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that bkf shall not be liable under this section 4 with respect to any preliminary prospectus or statement of additional information to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability results solely from such seller indemnified party's failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or amended, within the time required by the 1933 act to the person asserting the existence of an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities to such person, which untrue statement or omission was corrected in the final prospectus or statement of additional information; or (iii) a violation by bkf in connection with such offering or sale of such registrable securities; provided, however, that the indemnification agreement contained herein shall not apply to losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arising out of, or based upon, any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged omission, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished to bkf by any selling stockholder in writing specifically stating that it is for use in connection with the preparation of such registration statement or any preliminary or final prospectus or statement of 8 additional information contained in such registration statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any selling stockholder and shall survive the transfer of such securities by any selling stockholder and termination of this agreement. (b) each selling stockholder shall (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 4(a) to the extent to which it, they or any of them may become subject), indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, bkf, and each person, if any, who controls bkf within the meaning of the 1933 act, its directors, officers employees and affiliates, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to bkf by such selling stockholder in writing specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto; provided that the maximum amount required to be paid by each such selling stockholder under this provision shall not exceed the net aggregate proceeds received such selling stockholder from the sale of the securities under the registration statement during the registration term. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section 4, such person (hereinafter called the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (hereinafter called the "indemnifying party") in writing. if any such proceeding shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this section 4 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to such indemnifying party or that another legal conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. in the case of any such separate firm for the indemnified parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties with the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any 9 proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final non-appealable judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could reasonably be expected to have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 4 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in this section 4, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the statement or omission which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying and indemnified party from the offering of registrable securities covered by such registration statement; provided that for the purposes of this clause (ii) the relative benefits received by any selling stockholder shall be deemed not to exceed the amount of proceeds received by such selling stockholder. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any matter in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 4 hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. if indemnification is available under this section 4, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in section 4(a) and 4(b) hereof without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this section 4(d). 10 section 5. additional covenants. -------------------- (a) 144 exemption. with a view to making available to each investor the benefits of rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 act or any successor provision that may at any time permit an investor to sell securities of bkf to the public without registration, bkf agrees to use reasonable efforts to: (i) file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of bkf as a condition to the availability of sec rule 144; and (ii) furnish to any investor forthwith upon request a written statement by bkf that it has complied with the report requirements of sec rule 144.
