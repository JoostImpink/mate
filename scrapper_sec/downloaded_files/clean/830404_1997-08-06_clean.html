charles moss and thomas dibenedetto to the board, effective september 27, 1993. so long as charles moss or thomas dibenedetto, directly or indirectly, own or have the right to acquire from the issuer, collectively, more than 5% of the issuer's securities, charles moss and thomas dibenedetto, or their respective designees, are to be elected to the board.

thomas dibenedetto. the foregoing provisions of the 1993 purchase agreement would no longer be applicable upon consummation of the merger described below. at the time of the closing of the acquisition by moss, thomas dibenedetto and dibenedetto lp of the issuer's securities under the 1993 purchase agreement, affiliates of charles moss and thomas dibenedetto entered into two joint venture

theater. the second joint venture, organized under the name "showscan attractions venture", was formed for the purpose of being the exclusive vehicle through which showscan would develop, manage and operate additional "owned and operated" showscan theaters throughout the world. the parties to this joint venture are showscan attractions, inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the issuer, and moss

were section 424 applicable to such option. in addition, each 8% note outstanding prior to the effective time shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, during the period such 8% note shall be convertible, upon conversion of such 8% note, in lieu of each share of the issuer's common stock deliverable on such conversion immediately prior to the merger, such number of shares of iwerks common stock which are receivable upon the effectiveness of the merger by a holder of one share of the issuer's common stock. the obligations of the parties to the merger agreement to effect the merger are subject to certain conditions, and prior to the effective time, iwerks or the issuer may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, in each case as set forth in the merger agreement. under the merger agreement, the issuer has granted iwerks an option (the "iwerks option") to purchase up to 330,714 shares of the issuer's common stock at $4.14 per share in cash (the "exercise price"). provided no court order prohibiting the exercise of the iwerks option and subject to compliance with applicable law, iwerks may exercise the iwerks option in whole or in part at any time or from time to time after the occurrence of 28 29 both an initial triggering event and a purchase event but prior to an option termination event (as each term is defined below). under the merger agreement, an "initial triggering event" occurs upon the happening of one of the following events and a good faith determination by iwerks that there is a reasonable likelihood that, as a result of such event, consummation of the merger is jeopardized: (i) any person as defined in sections (a)(9) or 13(d)(3) of the exchange act (other than iwerks or any subsidiary of iwerks) shall have commenced a bona fide offer to purchase shares of the issuer's common stock such that, upon consummation of said offer, such person would own or control 10% or more of the outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock, or shall have entered into an agreement to (a) merge or consolidate or enter into any similar transaction, with the issuer, or (b) purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities representing 10% or more of the issuer's voting power, (ii) any person (other than iwerks or any subsidiary of iwerks) shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock, (iii) any person (other than iwerks or any subsidiary of iwerks) shall have made a bona fide proposal to the issuer after the date of the merger agreement by public announcement or written communication to (a) acquire the issuer by merger, consolidation, purchase of all or substantially all of its assets or any other similar transaction, or (b) make an offer described herein, (iv) any person shall have solicited proxies in a proxy solicitation subject to regulation 14a under the exchange act in opposition to approval of the merger agreement by the issuer's stockholders, or (v) any person shall have willfully breached any provision of the merger agreement, which breach would entitle iwerks to terminate the merger agreement, and such breach shall not have been cured pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. under the merger agreement, a "purchase event" shall have occurred at such time as the issuer is obligated to pay iwerks the company termination fee under section 10.3(a)(i) of the merger agreement. the "company termination fee" is a break-up fee payable by the issuer to iwerks in the amount of $1,500,000 in the event that the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances set forth in section 10.3(a) of the merger agreement. the iwerks option expires (an "option termination event") if not exercised as permitted under the merger agreement prior to the earlier of (i) the effective time, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of directors of iwerks and the issuer, (b) by either iwerks or the issuer, if the merger shall not have been consummated by december 31, 1997, other than by any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of or a substantial contributor to the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date, (c) by either iwerks or the issuer, if a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other action having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger, subject to certain conditions, (d) by action of the board of directors of the issuer if the board of directors of iwerks shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to the issuer its approval of the merger agreement or the merger or recommendation of the issuance of the iwerks common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement or the merger, (e) by iwerks or the issuer if, at a duly held meeting of the stockholders of the issuer (including any adjournment thereof) held for the purpose of voting on the merger, the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the holder of a majority of the outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock and series c preferred (voting as a single class) shall not have approved the merger and the merger agreement, (unless prior to the date of the meeting referred to therein an alternative proposal is publicly announced) or (f) by iwerks or the issuer, if, at a duly held meeting of the stockholders of iwerks (including any adjournment thereof) held for the purpose of voting on the issuance of the iwerks common stock in connection with the merger, the requisite vote of a majority of the holders of outstanding shares of iwerks common stock shall not have approved such issuance, or (iii) the first business day after the 365th calendar day following termination of the merger agreement for any of the following reasons: (a) by action of the board of directors of the issuer (following receipt of an alternative proposal (as defined in section 6.16 of the merger agreement) if (x) the board of directors of 29 30 the issuer determines in good faith, after advice of outside counsel, that such action is necessary in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties to stockholders imposed by law, and if (y) such board of directors is then in receipt of a written opinion from its financial advisor that such alternative proposal would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, subject to certain notice provisions, (b) by action of the board of directors of iwerks if the board of directors of the issuer shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to the issuer its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger or (c) by iwerks or the issuer, if, at a duly held meeting of the stockholders of the issuer (including any adjournment thereof) held for the purpose of voting on the merger, the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock and series c preferred (voting as a single class) shall not have approved the merger and the merger agreement (if prior to the date of the meeting referred to therein an alternative proposal is publicly announced). notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the exercise of the iwerks option is subject to any injunction prohibiting its exercise, the period within which iwerks may exercise the option shall be extended for a period of 60 days following such injunction's removal. in addition, under the merger agreement and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the issuer has granted iwerks certain registration rights covering the shares of common stock issued upon the exercise, if any, of the iwerks option. because approval by the issuer's stockholders is required by applicable law in order to consummate the merger, the issuer will submit the merger to its stockholders for approval. concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, the supporting stockholders have entered into the stockholder support agreements. pursuant to the stockholder support agreements, the supporting stockholders have agreed to vote all of their voting securities, currently representing (excluding currently exercisable warrants) an aggregate of 1,209,502 shares of the issuer's voting securities (or 18.3% of the outstanding voting securities), consisting of 237,280 shares of common stock and 972,222 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of series c preferred, in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and, in connection therewith, have granted an irrevocable proxy to roy a. wright and bruce hinckley to do the same in their place and stead. each stockholder support agreement terminates upon any termination of the merger agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or in the event that the board of directors of the issuer shall withdraw or modify in any manner materially adverse to iwerks its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger. subject to the terms and conditions of the stockholder support agreements, the supporting stockholders have agreed, from and after the date of such stockholder support agreements until the earlier of any termination of the stockholder support agreements or the effective time, that they will not, directly or indirectly, (a) sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of their respective voting securities, (b) deposit any of their respective voting securities into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any of their respective voting securities or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto which is inconsistent with the stockholder support agreements or (c) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any of the issuer's common stock or series c preferred. in addition, pursuant to the stockholder support agreements, the supporting stockholders have waived their rights to dissent in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with respect to any of their shares of series c preferred. 30 31 if the merger is completed as planned, at the effective time, the directors of merger sub immediately prior to the effective time shall become the directors, and the officers of the issuer immediately prior to the effective time shall become the officers, of the surviving corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed. the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the issuer in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. if the merger is completed as planned, the issuer intends to seek (i) to have the shares of its common stock cease to be listed on the nasdaq national market and (ii) if in conformity with applicable law and regulation, to have its shares of common stock deregistered under the exchange act. the preceding summary of certain provisions of the merger agreement and the stockholder support agreements is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements. the merger

company common stock and company preferred stock then owned by the company or any of its subsidiaries and any shares of the company common stock and company preferred stock then held by parent or any of its subsidiaries) shall, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of parent, sub, the company or the holder thereof, be canceled and converted into the right to receive the following: (i) each share of company common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall entitle the holder thereof to 0.85 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of parent common stock (the "per share consideration"); (ii) each share of company preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall entitle the holder thereof to that number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of parent common stock as is equal to the number of shares of company common stock into which such share of company preferred stock is convertible immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by 0.85; (iii) no fractional shares of parent common stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof, any holder of shares of company common stock or company preferred stock entitled to receive a fractional share of parent common stock shall be paid cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of multiplying such fraction by the average price; (iv) if more than one certificate representing shares of company common stock and/or company preferred stock shall be surrendered at one time for the account of the same stockholder of record, the number of full shares of parent common stock for which certificates shall be delivered shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the company common stock and/or company preferred stock, as the case may be, represented by the certificates so surrendered. all shares of company common stock and company preferred stock held by the company at the effective time as treasury shares or held by any of the company's subsidiaries or by parent or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, "treasury shares") shall cease to exist and the certificates for such shares shall, as promptly as practicable thereafter, be canceled and no shares of capital stock of parent or sub shall be issued in exchange therefor. (v) each outstanding share of capital stock of sub (the "sub capital stock") shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the surviving corporation. at the effective time, parent, as the sole holder of the sub capital stock, shall surrender any and all certificates representing such sub capital stock to the surviving corporation and shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation into which the sub capital stock theretofore represented by the certificates so surrendered shall have been converted as provided in this section 2.5(a)(v). from and after the effective time, until so surrendered, each certificate theretofore representing shares of issued and outstanding sub capital 8 14 stock shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence the number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation into which such shares of sub capital stock shall have been converted. (b) adjustment to the per share consideration. the per share consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of parent common stock, shares of company common stock or shares of company preferred stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change in the number of shares of parent common stock, shares of company common stock or shares of company preferred stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the effective time; provided, however, that no such changes to the capital stock of parent, the surviving corporation or the company shall be effected except as permitted by this agreement.

(d) delivery of new certificates. promptly after the effective time, parent shall cause the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates representing shares of company common stock and/or company preferred stock (a "certificate" and collectively the "certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as parent and the company may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of parent common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of parent common stock and (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this section 2.5(d), after giving effect to any required withholding tax, and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. no interest will be paid or accrued on the cash included within the exchange fund, payable to holders of certificates. if any certificate for shares of parent common stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which a certificate for shares of the company common stock and/or company preferred stock so 9 15 surrendered is then registered, such surrender shall be accompanied by payment of any applicable transfer taxes and documents required for a valid transfer. from and after the effective time, until so surrendered, each certificate theretofore representing shares of issued and outstanding company common stock and/or company preferred stock shall be deemed for all corporate purposes, except as provided in section 2.5(a) with respect to fractional shares and treasury shares, and except as set forth below, to evidence the number of whole shares of parent common stock into which such shares of company common stock and/or company preferred stock shall have been converted. unless and until any such certificates shall be so surrendered, the holder of such certificate shall not have any right to receive any cash amounts included in the exchange fund. upon surrender of a certificate representing the company common stock and/or company preferred stock, the holder of record thereof shall receive a certificate representing the whole shares of parent common stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares to which he shall be entitled, and all dividends and other distributions which shall have been paid or made to holders of record of parent common stock after the effective time with respect to such shares of parent common stock, without interest thereon. all such cash amounts unclaimed at the end of one year from the effective time shall be released or repaid by the exchange agent to parent, after which the holders of the shares not receiving such payment shall look, subject to applicable escheat or other laws, only to parent as general creditors for payment thereof. (e) no liability. none of parent, the company, the exchange agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of company common stock and/or company preferred stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. (f) lost, stolen or destroyed certificates. in the event any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the surviving corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the surviving corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the exchange agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the shares of parent common stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of parent common stock as provided in section 2.5(d), deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this agreement. 2.6 company purchase rights and convertible notes.

notwithstanding approval thereof by the stockholders of the company or parent: (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of directors of parent and the company; or (b) by either parent or the company, if the merger shall not have been consummated by december 31, 1997 (provided that the right to terminate this agreement under this section 10.1 shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this agreement has been the cause of or a substantial contributor to the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date); or (c) by either parent or the company, if a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other action having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger (provided that (i) if the party seeking to terminate this agreement pursuant to section 10.1 is subject to such order, decrees or ruling, it shall have used all reasonable efforts to have such order, decree or ruling removed and (ii) 40 46 the right to terminate this agreement under this

ruling or the taking of such action); (d) by action of the board of directors of the company (i) following receipt of an alternative proposal if (a) the board of directors of the company determines in good faith, after advice of outside counsel, that such action is necessary in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties to stockholders imposed by law, and if (b) such board of directors is then in receipt of a written opinion from its financial advisor that such alternative proposal would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this agreement; provided, however, prior to any such termination, the company notifies parent promptly of its intention to terminate this agreement or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an alternative proposal, but in no event shall such notice be given less than 48 hours prior to the public announcement of such action; or (ii) if the board of directors of parent shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to the company its approval of this agreement or the merger or recommendation of the issuance of the parent common stock pursuant to the terms of this agreement or the merger. (e) by action of the board of directors of parent if the board of directors of the company shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to parent its approval or recommendation of this agreement or the merger. (f) by parent or the company, if, at a duly held meeting of the stockholders of the company (including any adjournment thereof) held for the purpose of voting on the merger, this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of company common stock and company preferred stock (voting as a single class) shall not have approved the merger and this agreement; (g) by parent or the company, if, at a duly held meeting of the stockholders of parent (including any adjournment thereof) held for the purpose of voting on the issuance of the parent common stock in connection with the merger, the requisite vote of a majority of the holders of the outstanding shares of parent common stock shall not have approved such issuance. 10.2 option to purchase. (a) the company hereby grants to parent an irrevocable option (the "option") to purchase for an amount equal to $4.14 per share (the "per share price") in cash up to 330,714 authorized but unissued shares of company common stock (the "optioned shares"). the option shall expire (such event being referred to herein as the "option termination event") if not exercised as permitted under this agreement prior to the earlier of (i) the effective time, (ii) termination of this agreement in accordance with the provisions of section 10.1(a), 10.1(b), 10.1(c), 10.1(d)(ii), 10.1(f) (unless prior to the date of the meeting referred to therein an alternative proposal is publicly announced) or 10.1(g) or (iii) the first business day after the three hundred and sixty-fifth calendar day following termination of this agreement for any reason pursuant to 10.1(d)(i), 10.1(e) 41 47 or 10.1(f) (if prior to the date of the meeting referred to therein an alternative proposal is publicly announced); provided, however, that in the event that the exercise of the option shall be subject to any injunction prohibiting its exercise such period shall be extended for a period of sixty days following the removal of any such injunction. (b) provided that (i) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in the united states prohibiting the exercise of the option or the delivery of the optioned shares shall be in effect and (ii) any such exercise shall otherwise be subject to compliance with applicable law, parent may exercise the option in whole or in part at any time or from time to time after the occurrence of both an initial triggering event and a purchase event (as defined in section 10.2(d)) if, but only if, both the initial triggering event and the purchase event shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an option termination event. in the event that parent wishes to exercise the option, parent shall give written notice of such exercise (the date of such notice being herein called the "notice date") within 30 days following such purchase event to the company specifying the number of optioned shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and a place and date for the closing of such purchase. (c) at any closing of the exercise of the option, (i) parent will make payment to the company of the aggregate price for the optioned shares in immediately available funds, in an amount equal to the product of the per share price multiplied by the number of optioned shares being purchased at such closing and (ii) the company will deliver to parent a duly executed certificate or certificates representing the number of optioned shares so purchased, registered in the name of parent or its nominee in the denominations designated by parent in its notice of exercise. (d) for the purposes this section 10.2, an "initial triggering event" shall have occurred at such time as one of the following events shall have occurred and parent shall have determined in good faith (and shall have notified the company in writing of such determination) that there is a reasonable likelihood that, as a result of the occurrence of any of the following events, consummation of the merger pursuant to the term of this agreement is jeopardized: (i) any person as defined in sections (a)(9) or 13(d)(3) of the exchange act (other than parent or any subsidiary of parent) shall have commenced a bona fide offer to purchase shares of company common stock such that, upon consummation of said offer, such person would own or control 10% or more of the outstanding shares of company common stock, or shall have entered into an agreement to (a) merge or consolidate or enter into any similar transaction, with the company, or (b) purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of the company; (ii) any person (other than parent or any subsidiary of parent) shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of the company common stock (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this section 10.2(d) having the meaning assigned thereto in section 13(d) of the exchange act); (iii) any person (other than parent or any subsidiary of parent) shall have made a bona fide proposal to the company after the date of this agreement by public announcement or written communication to (a) acquire the company by merger, consolidation, purchase of all or substantially all of its assets or any other similar transaction, or (b) make an offer described herein; (iv) any person shall have solicited 42 48 proxies in a proxy solicitation subject to regulation 14a under the exchange act in opposition to approval of this agreement by the company's stockholders; (v) or any person shall have willfully breached any provision of this agreement, which breach would entitle parent to terminate this agreement and such breach shall not have been cured pursuant to the terms of this agreement and prior to parent's request under this section 10.2. for purposes of this section 10.2, a "purchase event" shall have occurred at such time as the company is obligated to pay to parent the company termination fee set forth in section 10.3(a)(i). (e) at any time commencing upon the occurrence of a purchase event at parent's or company's request, the company shall pay to parent an amount equal to the difference between the "market/tender offer" price for shares of company common stock (defined as the higher of the average price per share at which a tender or exchange offer has been made or the highest reported sale price for shares of company common stock on the date parent or the company gives notice of the required payment under this section 10.2) and the per share price, as adjusted pursuant to section 10.2(f) which difference shall be multiplied by the total number of optioned shares as to which the option has not theretofore been exercised, as adjusted pursuant to section 10.2(f), but only if the market/tender offer price is greater than such exercise price. in the event that the company makes a payment directly to parent of the amounts provided for in this section 10.2(e), such payment shall extinguish all other rights of parent under this option but shall not affect the rights of parent under the agreement or otherwise. (f) if between the date of this agreement and the effective time, the shares of the company common stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the number of optioned shares and the per share price shall be adjusted appropriately so as to restore parent to its rights hereunder, at an adjusted per share purchase price equal to the per share price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of the company common stock purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of company common stock purchasable after the adjustment; provided, however, that nothing in this option shall be construed as permitting the company to take any action or enter into any transaction prohibited by this agreement. (g) the company shall, if requested by parent, as expeditiously as possible file a registration statement on a form of general use under the securities act if necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of the shares of company common stock that have been acquired upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition requested by parent. parent shall provide all information reasonably requested by the company for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. the company will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of two hundred and seventy calendar days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. the registration effected under this section 10.2 shall be at the company's expense except for all agency fees and commissions and underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of such securities, which amounts shall be borne by parent. in no event shall 43 49 the company be required to effect more than one registration hereunder regardless of the number of assignees. the filing of any registration statement hereunder may be delayed for such period of time as may reasonably be required if the company determines that any such filing or the offering of any such shares of company common stock would (i) impede, delay or otherwise interfere with any financing, offer or sale of company common stock or any other securities of the company, or (ii) require disclosure of material information which, if disclosed at that time, would be materially harmful to the interests of the company and its shareholders. if requested by parent in connection with any such registration, the company will become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting agreements. upon receiving any request from parent or an assignee thereof under this section 10.2(g) the company agrees to send a copy thereof to parent and to any assignee thereof known to the company, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. 10.3 effect of termination.

(c) if this agreement is terminated pursuant to section 10.1, this agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto, except that (a) the agreements contained in section 6.8, the last sentence of section 6.3 and sections 10.3(a) and 10.3(b) shall survive the termination hereof and (b) if termination of this agreement shall be judicially determined to have been caused by willful breach of this agreement, then, in addition to other remedies at law or equity for breach of this agreement, the party so found to have willfully breached this agreement shall indemnify the other parties for their respective costs, fees and expenses of their counsel, accountants and other experts and advisors as well as fees and expenses incident to negotiation,
