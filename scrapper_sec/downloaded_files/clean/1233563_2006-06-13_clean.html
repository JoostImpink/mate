(b) procedures. following the receipt of a request for demand registration, the company will promptly give written notice of such request to all investors other than those that were parties to such request, and, thereupon, will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed and declared effective, as soon as practicable, a registration statement on such appropriate form as the company in its reasonable discretion shall determine providing for the sale of all of such registrable securities requested to included by the investors that were parties to such request and all other registrable securities that the company has been requested to register by other investors by written request (which shall specify the number of registrable securities to be registered and the intended method of disposition thereof) received by the company within 30 days after the giving of such written notice by the company; provided, however, that, subject to section 2(d), below, such registration statement shall be filed with the sec not later than the filing date deadline. promptly after expiration of the 20 day period referred to in this section 2(b), the company will notify all the investors entitled to be included in the registration statement of the other investors that have requested inclusion and the number of registrable securities requested to be included therein. (c) number of, and limitations on, registrations. the investors will be entitled to request three (3) demand registrations. the company will not be obligated to register any registrable securities pursuant to such a demand registration unless there is requested to be included in such registration at least five percent (5%) of the then outstanding shares of common stock. (d) suspension periods. notwithstanding section 2(b), the company may postpone the filing or effectiveness of any registration statement for any demand registration or the filing or effectiveness of any amendment or supplement to any such registration statement (whether required by section 4(c) or otherwise), if the company in good faith determines and notifies the investors that (i) such registration (or such amendment or supplement) would have an adverse effect on any plan or proposal by the company with respect to any financing, acquisition, recapitalization, reorganization or other material transaction, or (ii) the company is in possession of material non-public information which would be required to be disclosed in such registration statement (or such amendment or supplement) and the company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving such information as confidential; provided, however, that the company shall not exercise its rights under this section 2(d) (a) to the extent that the postponement or postponements relating to any demand registration(s) and amendments and supplements thereto would exceed an aggregate of 90 days in any calendar year or (b) to the extent that the postponement or postponements relating to any demand registration(s) and 3 amendments and supplements thereto would exceed an aggregate of 30 days in the first six months of 2006. (e) expenses. in any registration initiated as a demand registration, the company will pay all registration expenses, whether or not the registration statement has become effective. (f) effectiveness of registration statement. subject to section 2(g), a registration statement will not count as a registration pursuant to a demand registration until it has been declared effective by the sec. (g) selection of underwriters. if any of the registrable securities covered by a demand registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, or in a best efforts underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering will be selected by the investors, subject to the approval of the company, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. if the investors disapprove of the terms and conditions of the underwriting, the investors may elect to withdraw all their respective registrable securities by written notice to the company and the managing underwriter and, at the election of' the investors, either (i) pay the costs and expenses associated therewith (in which case such withdrawn registration shall not constitute a demand registration) or (ii) permit the company to pay the same (in which case such withdrawn registration shall constitute one of the investors' two demand registrations); provided, however, that, if the company has already filed a registration statement pursuant to such demand by the investor, the investor's withdrawn registration will nevertheless constitute a demand registration pursuant to this agreement. for purposes of this section 2(g), the investors holding a majority of the registrable securities (treating shares of common stock and shares of series c preferred stock as fungible) to be registered on the registration statement filed for the demand registration shall have the right to act for the investors. (h) underwriter cutback. if the managing underwriter of any offering of registrable securities pursuant to a demand registration that is an underwritten offering advises the company in writing that, in its reasonable opinion, the aggregate amount of registrable securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the success of the offering, the company will include in such registration statement the aggregate amount of registrable securities which in the opinion of such managing underwriter can be sold without any such material adverse effect, and such amount of registrable securities shall be allocated in the following order: (i) first, to the investors, pro rata in accordance with the number of registrable securities sought to be registered by them on the registration statement; and (ii) second, to the company and to any holder of common stock exercising piggyback or incidental registration rights with respect to such demand registration. 3. piggyback registration rights. (a) if the company at any time following the date hereof proposes to register any of its shares of common stock on its own behalf or any of its shares of common stock on behalf of other stockholders on a form and in a manner that would permit registration of registrable 4 securities under the securities act, it will each such time give prompt notice in accordance with the provisions of section 14(e)(ii) of this agreement to the investors of its intention to do so, specifying the form and manner and the other relevant facts involved in such proposed registration (including, without limitation, the identity of the managing underwriter, if any). upon the written request of the investors delivered to the company within thirty (30) days after such notice shall have been delivered to the investors (which request shall specify the registrable securities intended to be disposed of by such holder and the intended method of disposition thereof), the company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of all registrable securities that the company has been so requested to register by the investors, to the extent requisite to permit the sale of the registrable securities to be so registered; provided, however, that: (i) if, at any time after giving such written notice of its intention to register any common stock proposed to be registered by the company and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to register such common stock, the company shall, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the investors, and thereupon the company shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay the registration expenses in connection therewith to the extent provided in section 6); and (ii) if the managing underwriter of such offering shall advise the company that, in its judgment, the number of shares of common stock proposed to be included in such offering should be limited because the inclusion of registrable securities is likely to adversely impact the purchase price obtained for the common stock proposed to be included in such offering, then the company will promptly advise the investors thereof and may require, by written notice to the investors accompanying such advice, that, to the extent necessary to meet such limitation, all holders of registrable securities and of other shares of common stock proposing pursuant to piggyback or incidental registration rights to sell common stock in such offering shall share pro rata in the number of shares of common stock to be excluded from such offering, such sharing to be based on the respective numbers of registrable securities and other shares of common stock as to which registration has been requested by such holders, and that the distribution of such registrable securities and other shares of common stock as are so excluded be deferred (in case of a deferral as to a portion of such registrable securities and other shares of common stock, such portion to be allocated among such holders in proportion to the respective numbers of common stock so requested to be registered by such holders) until the completion of the distribution of such common stock and any other securities by such underwriters. (b) the holders of registrable securities to be distributed by underwriters in an underwritten offering shall be parties to the underwriting agreement between the company and the underwriters. any such holder of registrable securities shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such holder, such holder's registrable 5 securities and such holder's intended method of distribution and any other representation required by law. (c) in any registration initiated pursuant to this section 3, the company will pay all registration expenses, whether or not the registration statement has become effective, except as otherwise provided on section 6. (d) notwithstanding anything in this section 3 to the contrary, in the event that the company is registering shares of common stock and no other class of security pursuant to a demand registration under the registration rights agreement dated as of july 15, 1998 by and among the company and the purchasers (as listed on the signature page thereto), then the rights of the investors under this section 3 shall apply only with respect to shares of common stock that are registrable securities and not any shares of series c preferred stock. 4. obligations of the company. in connection with the company's obligation under sections 2 and 3, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to the registration statement and the prospectus as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all registrable securities covered by the registration statement; provided, however, that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, or comparable statements under securities or blue sky laws of the states of new york, ------------------- and --------------------, the company will furnish to counsel to the investors participating in the planned offering ("designated counsel"), upon delivery by designated counsel of its agreement, on terms reasonably satisfactory to the company, to maintain the confidentiality of material and information furnished pursuant to this section 4(a), copies of the "selling securitvholder" and "plan of distribution" sections of such filings, or, at the request of an investor, of all such documents proposed to be filed (including all exhibits thereto), which documents will be subject to the reasonable review and reasonable comment of such counsel. (b) furnish to the investors such number of copies of the prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents (including, without limitation, prospectus amendments and supplements as are prepared by the company in accordance with section 4(a) above) as the investors may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of such investors' registrable securities. (c) promptly notify the investors, at any time when the prospectus relating to the registration statement is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event (without disclosing the nature or substance of such event) as a result of which the prospectus included in or relating to the registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and, thereafter, and subject to section 2(d), the company will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare (and, when completed, give notice to each investor) a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or 6 omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that upon such notification by the company of the foregoing and instructing each investor to cease to offer and sell registrable securities, each investor will use commercially reasonable efforts to cease its offer and sale of registrable securities until the company has notified the investors that it has prepared a supplement or amendment to such prospectus and delivered copies of such supplement or amendment to the investors (it being understood and agreed by the company that the foregoing proviso shall in no way diminish or otherwise impair the company's obligation to promptly prepare a prospectus amendment or supplement as above provided in this section 4(c) and deliver copies of same as above provided in section 4(b) hereof).

(e) the obligations of the company and the investors under this section 7 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement. (f) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to settle any claim, suit or proceeding unless in connection with such settlement the indemnified party receives an unconditional release with respect to the subject matter of such claim, suit or proceeding and such settlement does not contain any admission of fault by the indemnified party. 8. reports under the exchange act. with a view to making available to the investors the benefits of rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the sec that may at any time permit the investors to sell the registrable securities to the public without registration, the company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts: (i) to make and keep public information available, as that term is understood and defined in rule 144; (ii) to file with the sec in a timely 11 manner all reports and other documents required to be filed by an issuer of securities registered under the securities act or the exchange act; (iii) as long as any investor owns any registrable securities, to furnish in writing upon such investor's request a written statement by the company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of rule 144 and of the exchange act; and (iv) subject to section 2(d) and section 4(c), undertake any additional actions reasonably necessary to maintain the availability of the registration statement (but not for more than nine months after it first became effective) or the use of rule 144. 9. transfer of registration rights. none of the rights of any investor under this agreement shall be transferred or assigned to any person unless (i) such person is (a) an affiliate of an investor; or (b) after such transfer or assignment, holds at least 10% of the aggregate number of initial registrable securities; and (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to become subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. 10. no required sale. nothing in this agreement shall be deemed to create an independent obligation on the part of any investor to sell any registrable securities pursuant to any effective registration statement. 11. nominees for beneficial owners. if registrable securities are held by a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof, the beneficial owner thereof may, at its option, be treated as the holder of such registrable securities for purposes of any request or other action by any investor pursuant to this agreement (or any determination of any number or percentage of shares constituting registrable securities held by any investor contemplated by this agreement); provided that the company shall have received assurances reasonably satisfactory to it of such beneficial ownership. 12. limitations on subsequent registration rights. the company represents and warrants that from and after the date of this agreement, it shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders of at least 50% of the registrable securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement (or amendment or waiver of the provisions of any agreement) with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company that would grant such holder registration rights that are pari passu (except with respect to piggyback or incidental registration rights) or senior to those granted to the investors hereunder. 13. entire agreement. this agreement and exhibits attached hereto and incorporated herewith constitute and contain the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior negotiations, correspondence, agreements or understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof and supercedes all prior agreements, negotiations, understandings, representations and statements respecting the subject matter hereof, whether oral or written. 14. miscellaneous.

(a) request. at any time after the date hereof, upon the written request of the purchasers that the company effect the registration under the securities act of all or part (subject to section 2.01(f)) of the purchasers' registrable securities and specifying the types of registrable securities to be registered and the intended method of disposition thereof, the company will give prompt written notice of such request to all registered holders of registrable securities, and thereupon the company will, subject to the terms of this agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of: (i) the registrable securities which the company has been requested to register by the purchasers, and (ii) all other registrable securities which the company has been requested to register by written request of the holders thereof given to the company within 30 days after the giving of the aforesaid written notice by the company (specifying the intended method of disposition of such registrable securities), all to the extent 5 requisite to permit the intended disposition of the registrable securities to be so registered. (b) registration of other securities. whenever the company shall effect a registration pursuant to this section 2.01 in connection with an underwritten offering by one or more holders of registrable securities, no securities other than registrable securities shall be included among the securities covered by such registration unless (i) the managing underwriter of such offering shall have advised the purchasers in writing that the inclusion of such other securities would not adversely affect such offering or (ii) the purchasers shall have consented in writing to the inclusion of such other securities. (c) registration statement form. registrations under this section 2.01 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the commission (i) as shall be selected by the company and (ii) as shall permit the disposition of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition specified in their request for such registration; provided, however, that if at the time of such registration the company satisfies the eligibility requirements for use of a registration statement on form s-3 under the securities act, the purchasers may request a registration on form s-3 for an offering to be 6 made on a continuous basis pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act (a "shelf registration") and the company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the registration to be made on such form. the company agrees to include in any such registration statement all information which, in the opinion of counsel to the purchasers or counsel to the company, is required to be included. (d) effective registration statement. a registration requested pursuant to this section 2.01 shall not be deemed to have been effected and will not be considered one of the three demand registrations which may be requested pursuant to this agreement (i) if the registration statement with respect thereto does not become effective, (ii) if after it has become effective, it does not remain effective for a period of at least 90 days or, in the case of a shelf registration, one year (or in each case such shorter period during which all the registrable securities registered thereunder are sold or disposed of) or such registration is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason and has not thereafter become effective, or (iii) if the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied 7 or waived other than by reason of the failure or refusal of a holder of registrable securities to satisfy or perform a condition to such closing or a default by an underwriter. if a demand is made pursuant to section 2.01 and the company files a registration statement and causes (or is in the process of causing) such registration statement to become effective and the holders requesting registration decide not to proceed with such registration for reasons other than a breach by the company of its obligations hereunder or the company's inability or failure to obtain the effectiveness of such registration statement, such request shall nevertheless count as one demand under section 2.01. (e) priority in demand registrations. if a demand registration pursuant to this section 2.01 involves an underwritten offering, and the managing underwriter shall advise the company in writing (with a copy sent to each holder of the registrable securities requesting registration) that the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to the purchasers or such other person entitled to make a demand registration pursuant to section 8 hereof, such registration will include only that number of registrable securities which the company is so advised can be sold in 8 such offering, drawn pro rata from the holders of the registrable securities requesting such registration on the basis of the percentage of registrable securities held by the holders of registrable securities which have requested that such securities be included. in connection with any such registration, no securities other than registrable securities shall be covered by such registration. (f) limitations on registration; expenses. the company will not be required to effect, in the aggregate, more than three demand registrations pursuant to this section 2.01 (or any other provision of this agreement), of which the company shall pay all registration expenses in connection with all three demand registrations. the company shall not be required to effectuate any registration pursuant to this section 2.01 within less than six months after the end of the effectiveness period of any other registration pursuant to section 2.01. notwithstanding the foregoing, no demand may be made in respect of a number of registrable securities by all holders demanding registration which is less than the lesser of (x) 25% of the total registrable securities originally issued (or the equivalent thereof in the case of securities issued upon the conversion thereof) or (y) the number of registrable securities having 9 a market value (as reasonably estimated in good faith by the holders requesting registration) of at least $10,000,000. section 2.02. incidental registration. (a) right to include the registrable securities. if the company at any time proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act by registration on forms s-l, s-2 or s-3 or any successor or similar form(s), whether or not for sale for its own account, it will each such time give prompt written notice to the purchasers and all other holders of registrable securities of its intention to do so and of such holders' rights under this section 2.02. upon the written request of any such holder made within 30 days after the receipt of any such notice (15 days if the company gives telephonic notice to all holders of registrable securities, with written confirmation to follow promptly thereafter, stating that (i) such registration will be on form s-3 and (ii) such shorter period of time is required because of a planned filing date) (which request shall specify the registrable securities to be disposed of by such holder), the company will, subject to the next sentence, use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of all registrable securities which the company has been so requested to register by the holders thereof, to the extent requisite to permit the disposition 10 of such registrable securities to be so registered. if the company thereafter determines for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each holder of registrable securities and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of the obligation to register such registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from any obligation of the company to pay the registration expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights (if any) of the purchasers or an assignee to request that such registration be effected as a registration under section 2.01, and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registration, shall be permitted to delay registering any registrable securities, for the same period as the delay in registration of such other securities. all obligations of the company with respect to any registration described in this section 2.02(a) shall be subject to the rights of the company set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. no registration effected under this section 2.02 shall relieve the company of its obligation to effect any registration upon request under section 2.01. the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with registration of 11 registrable securities requested pursuant to this section 2.02. if such offering is to be underwritten, the holders seeking to sell such registrable securities agree to join in such underwritten offering. (b) priority in incidental registrations. in a registration pursuant to this section 2.02 involving an underwritten offering of the securities so being registered, whether or not for sale for the account of the company by or through one or more underwriters of recognized standing, if the managing underwriter of such underwritten offering shall inform the company and the holders of registrable securities requesting registration in such offering by letter of its belief that the number or type of securities to be included in such registration would interfere with the successful marketing of the securities being distributed by such underwriters, then the company will be required to include in such registration only that number and type of registrable securities which it is so advised can be sold in such offering, drawn pro rata from the holders of registrable securities requesting such registration and the holders of any other securities to be registered (whether or not pursuant to the exercise of a demand registration right by such holders) on the basis of the number of securities the registration of which shall have been requested by such 12 holders (it being understood that this provision shall not limit the number of securities that the company shall be entitled to register for sale for its own account). section 2.03. registration procedures. in connection with the company's obligations pursuant to sections 2.01 and 2.02 hereof, the company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect such registrations to permit the sale of registrable securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the company will as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 30 days after the end of the period within which requests for registration may be given to the company, file with the commission (but not earlier than 90 days after the end of the company's fiscal year or 45 days after the end of the last fiscal quarter), a registration statement or registration statements on the appropriate form under the securities act, which form shall be available for the sale of the registrable securities by the holders thereof in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and use its reasonable best 13 efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and to remain continuously effective for a period of 90 days following the date on which such registration statement is declared effective (or, in the case of a shelf registration, for a period of one year following such date); provided that the company shall have no obligation to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement after the sale of all registrable securities registered thereunder or for a period longer than that specified in this paragraph (a); (b) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and post-effective amendments to the registration statement as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for the applicable period; cause the related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to rule 424 under the securities act; and comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended 14 methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement or supplement to such prospectus; (c) notify the selling holders of registrable securities, and the managing underwriters, if any, promptly, and (if requested by any such person) confirm such advice in writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any request by the commission for amendments or supplements to a registration statement or related prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv)if at any time the representations and warranties of the company made as contemplated by section 2.04(a) below cease to be true and correct in any material respect, (v) of the receipt by the company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any of the 15 registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (vi) of the happening of any event which requires the making of any changes in a registration statement or related prospectus so that such documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (vii) if the company reasonably determines that a post-effective amendment to a registration statement would be appropriate; (d) use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of a prospectus or suspending the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible moment. (e) if requested by the managing underwriters or any holder of registrable 16 securities being sold in connection with an underwritten offering, immediately incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the managing underwriters and such holder agree should be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of registrable securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of registrable securities being sold to such underwriters, the purchase price being paid therefor by such underwriters and with respect to any other terms of the underwritten (or best efforts underwritten) offering of the registrable securities to be sold in such offering; make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; and supplement or make amendments to any registration statement if requested by any holder of registrable securities covered by such registration statement or any underwriter of such registrable securities;

the company consents to the use of such prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling holders of registrable securities and the underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the registrable securities covered by such prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto; (h) prior to any public offering of registrable securities, use its reasonable best 18 efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the selling holders of registrable securities, the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification of such registrable securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any selling holder or underwriter reasonably requests in writing; keep each such registration or qualification effective during the period such registration statement is required to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the registrable securities covered by the applicable registration statement; provided that the company will not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject; (i) cooperate with the selling holders of registrable securities and the managing underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely 19 preparation and delivery of certificates representing registrable securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends unless required by applicable law; and enable such registrable securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriters may request at least two business days prior to any sale of registrable securities to the underwriters; (j) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registrable securities covered by the applicable registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities;

(b) indemnification by the sellers. the company may require, as a condition to including any registrable securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to section 2.01 or 2.02, that the company shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the prospective seller of such securities, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section 2.07(a)) the company, each 32 director of the company, each officer of the company and each other person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in, or omission or alleged omission from, such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument duly executed by such seller specifically stating that it is for use in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, amendment or supplement. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. in no event shall any indemnity or contribution paid by any seller to the company pursuant to this section 2.07, or otherwise, exceed the proceeds received by such seller in such offering. in the case of an underwritten offering of registrable securities, each holder of registrable securities shall agree to indemnify such underwriters, their officers and directors, if any, and each person, if any, who controls such underwriters within the 33 meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act, with respect to information furnished by them for use in the registration statement or prospectus to the extent customary in the circumstances for a selling stockholder in an underwritten public offering. (c) notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.07(a), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter within five days of the commencement of such action; provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.07(a), except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable good faith judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other 34 indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. in the event that the indemnifying party advises an indemnified party that it will contest a claim for indemnification hereunder, or fails, within thirty (30) days of receipt of any indemnification notice to notify, in writing, such person of its election to defend, settle or compromise, at its sole cost and expense, any action, proceeding or claim (or discontinues its defense at any time after it commences such defense), then the indemnified party may, at its option, defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay such action or claim. in any event, unless and until the indemnifying party elects in writing to assume and does so assume the defense of any such claim, proceeding or action, the indemnified party's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses arising out of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such action, claim or proceeding shall be losses subject to indemnification hereunder. the 35 indemnified party shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the indemnified party which relates to such action or claim. the indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party fully appraised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. if the indemnifying party elects to defend any such action or claim, then the indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in such defense with counsel of its choice at its sole cost and expense. if the indemnifying party does not assume such defense, the indemnified party shall keep the indemnifying party appraised at all times as to the status of the defense; provided, however, that the failure to keep the indemnifying party so informed shall not affect the obligations of the indemnifying party hereunder. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its written consent; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be 36 unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. (d) contribution. (i) if the indemnification from the indemnifying party as provided in this section 2.07 is unavailable or is otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the indemnifying party shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue (or alleged untrue) statement of a material fact or omission (or alleged omission) to state a 37 material fact, has been made, or related to information supplied by such indemnifying party, and the parties3 relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 2.07(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (ii) the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.07 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. if however, indemnification is available under this section 2.07, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the fullest extent provided in section 2.07(a) and (b) hereof without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or indemnified 38 party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this section 2.07(d). (e) indemnification payments. the indemnification and contribution required by this section 2.07(a) shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred. (f) other rights; liabilities. the indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the indemnified party against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law. section 2.08. adjustments affecting registrable securities. (a) during any period commencing on either (i) the date a request for a demand registration has been made pursuant to section 2.01(a) hereof or (ii) the date on which any holder of registrable securities makes written request in accordance with the terms of section 2.02(a) hereof to have its registrable shares registered, and in either event, terminating on the date which is the earlier of (i) 180 days after the date on which the registration statement 39 registering such registrable securities becomes effective and (ii) the date on which all registrable securities registered under such registration statement are sold, transferred or disposed of, the company will not, without the consent of the purchasers, effect, permit to occur or announce any future intent to effect or permit to occur, any combination or subdivision of shares which would materially adversely affect the ability of the holders of registrable securities to include registrable securities in any registration of securities contemplated by this section 2 or the marketability of registrable securities under any such registration. section 2.09. registration expenses. (a) except as provided in section 2.09(b), all expenses incident to the company's performance of or compliance with this agreement, including without limitation (i) any allocation of salaries and expenses of company personnel or other general overhead expenses of the company, or other expenses for the preparation of historical and pro forma financial statements or other data normally prepared by the company in the ordinary course of business or customarily prepared by the issuer in a public offering; (ii) all registration, application, filing, listing, transfer and registrar fees; (iii) all national association of securities dealers fees 40 and fees and expenses of registration or qualification of registrable securities under state securities or blue sky laws; (iv) all word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses; and (v) the fees and disbursements of counsel for the company and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel retained by the holder or holders a majority of the registrable securities being registered and the fees and disbursements of the company's independent public accountants, including the expenses of customary "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance; and (vi) subject to the proviso hereinbelow, any fees and disbursements of underwriters and broker-dealers customarily paid by issuers or sellers of securities (all such expenses being herein called "registration expenses") will be borne or caused to be borne by the company whether or not any of the registration statements become effective provided, however, that in all cases in which the company is required to pay registration expenses hereunder, registration expenses shall exclude, and the sellers of the registrable securities being registered shall pay, all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes in respect of the registrable securities under state securities or blue sky laws. 41 section 2.10. other sales. (a) the company hereby agrees not to effect, any public sale or distribution of any securities of the same class as (or otherwise similar to) the registrable securities, or any securities which, with notice, lapse of time and/or payment of monies, are exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into any such securities, or to enter into any agreement to make, file a registration statement for, or announce any such public sale or distribution of, any such securities, excluding the grant and exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares in connection with acquisitions as long as all executive officers, directors and other affiliates of the entity being acquired have agreed in writing to the restrictions set forth in this section 2.10(a), during the 15-day period prior to, and during the 90-day period commencing on, the effective date of a registration statement filed with the commission in connection with an underwritten offering effected pursuant to section 2.1 of this agreement without the prior written consent of the managing underwriters of such offering.
