("llcp") entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which llcp acquired a secured senior note due 2000 in the principal amount of $5,000,000 (the "term a note"), a secured senior note due 2003 in the principal amount of $15,000,000 (the "term b note" and collectively with the term a note, the "notes"), and a warrant to purchase 850,000 shares of common stock (the "warrant" and collectively with the notes, the "securities"). the execution of an investor rights agreement among the issuer, llcp, and the principal shareholders dated december 31, 1999 (the "investor rights agreement") was a condition to the obligation of llcp to purchase the securities. such parties have amended or will amend the investor rights agreement pursuant to a first amendment to investor rights agreement dated december 31, 1999 (the "first amendment"). the investor rights agreement, as amended or as to be amended by the first amendment, is referred to in this schedule 13d as the "investor rights agreement." under the investor rights agreement, the issuer and the principal shareholders granted llcp certain investment monitoring and other rights. among other things, if an event of default (as defined in the investor rights agreement) occurs, llcp has the right to require the issuer to cause to be elected to the issuer's board of directors an individual designated by llcp (the "llcp representative"). the llcp representative must remain a member until the later to occur of (a) the 180th day after the effective date of such election and (b) the date upon which the next annual meeting of the shareholders at which directors are to be elected shall occur. in connection with such election, each principal shareholder must vote his shares so that the llcp representative shall be elected or appointed to the board for such period. subject to certain exceptions, in no event shall the issuer, the board, any principal shareholder or any other person (other than llcp) remove the llcp representative from the board without the prior written consent of llcp. page 4 of 6 pages 5 in addition, llcp has certain co-sale rights under the investor rights agreement. if one or more principal shareholders propose to sell or transfer any shares of common stock owned by them ("co-sale shares") as of the date of the investor rights agreement in any transaction that does not constitute a public sale (as defined in the investor rights agreement), they must notify the issuer and llcp in writing (the "co-sale notice") at least 20 days before closing the proposed sale or transfer. llcp has the right, exercisable upon written notice to the principal shareholders within 15 days after receipt of the co-sale notice, to participate in such sale on the same terms and conditions as specified in the co-sale notice. to the extent that llcp exercises such right, the number of shares that the principal shareholders may sell in the transaction is correspondingly reduced. llcp may sell all or any portion of that number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of common stock covered by the co-sale notice, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock or warrant shares, as applicable, owned by llcp at the time of the sale or transfer (collectively, the "llcp shares"), and the denominator of which is the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock owned by the principal shareholders and llcp at the time of the sale or transfer. in the event of any sale or purported sale of co-sale shares by any principal shareholder in contravention of llcp's co-sale rights, llcp may exercise a right (the "prohibited transfer put") to require such principal shareholder to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares llcp would have been entitled to sell to the purchaser as described in the above paragraph. the co-sale rights and the prohibited transfer put rights do not apply, however, to the first 1,000,000 shares of common stock now owned by mr. desjardins which are sold by him. in addition, llcp's rights with respect to the co-sale shares owned or held by any principal shareholder terminate on the date that is 180 days following the date his employment by the issuer, if applicable, is terminated. further, all of llcp's co-sale rights and prohibited transfer put rights expire on december 31, 2006. in addition, the issuer granted to llcp the right to purchase up to a pro rata share of new securities (as defined in the investor rights agreement) which the issuer may from time to time propose to sell and issue. finally, llcp shall not, without the prior written consent of the issuer, acquire shares of common stock after december 31, 1999 if, after giving effect to the number of shares of common stock then owned or held by llcp, llcp would beneficially own or hold more than 15% of the common stock calculated at such time on a fully diluted basis. a copy of the investor rights agreement is attached as exhibit 99.1 and a copy of the form of the first amendment is attached as exhibit 99.2, and

(b) in no event shall the company, the board, any principal shareholder or any other person (other than llcp) have the power to remove the llcp representative from the board, without the prior written consent of llcp, other than pursuant to an order or decree of any governmental authority or for "cause" (which shall include conviction of a felony or any act involving moral turpitude or willful failure to perform his duties as a director). -2- 3 (c) in the event of the death or resignation of the llcp representative at any time, or in the event the llcp representative shall not be elected to the board at any election of directors for any reason, the company shall, upon the request of llcp, promptly (and in any event within five (5) days of such request) take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause another person designated by llcp to become the llcp representative on the board, including increasing the size of the board and/or filling the resulting vacancy with an llcp representative. such steps may include calling and holding, in accordance with the bylaws of the company and applicable laws, a special meeting of the board or the shareholders of the company or circulating a written consent for execution by members of the board and/or the shareholders. to the extent that the board delegates any of its duties to an executive committee or other committee, the llcp representative shall, upon the request of llcp, be appointed to such committee. (d) the agreements set forth in this section 1.1 are intended to constitute enforceable voting agreements within the scope of section 706(a) of the general corporation law of the state of california. 1.2 observation rights. without limiting any of the rights of llcp in this section 1, and whether or not any llcp representative is then serving on the board, llcp shall receive notice of and be entitled to have, at llcp's option, two (2) representatives or one (1) representative and one (1) advisor to such representative, attend as observers all meetings of the board and of all committees thereof and at all meetings of the shareholders of the company. notice of such meetings shall be given to llcp in the same manner and at the same time as to the members of the board or such committees (which in any event shall not be less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to such meeting unless otherwise agreed to by llcp in advance and in writing) and at the same time as to the shareholders of the company, as the case may be. llcp shall be provided with copies of (i) a meeting agenda, if any is prepared, (ii) all information that is provided to the members of the board or such committees or to the shareholders of the company (whether prior to, at, or subsequent to any such meetings), as the case may be, at the same time as such materials are provided to the members of the board or such committee or to the shareholders of the company, as the case may be, and (iii) copies of the minutes of all meetings of the board and such committees and of all meetings of shareholders concurrently with the distribution of such minutes to one or more members of the board or such committees or shareholders, as the case may be, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after each such meeting. 1.3 monthly operating meetings. in each calendar month after the date hereof, representatives of llcp and of the company shall meet to review the financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries as reflected in the financial information furnished to section 9.3 of the securities purchase agreement. each meeting shall at all times be comprised of at least two (2) members of senior management of the company, who initially shall be donald -3- 4 w. townsend and james a. saunders, and two (2) individuals designated by llcp (who shall be representatives of levine leichtman capital partners, inc.

(collectively, the "llcp parties"), from and against all costs, expenses, liabilities, claims, judgments, damages and losses, including, without limitation, all attorneys' fees and the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith, incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (collectively, "liabilities and costs"), arising out of or in any way related to the fact that any llcp party is or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the company or any subsidiary of the company, is or was serving as an observer of the board, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise and, in connection with any llcp party serving as such director, officer, employee or other agent, that such llcp party acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the company. -4- 5 2.2 upon request by any llcp party, the company, shall advance (within five (5) business days of such request) any and all expenses, including, without limitation, any and all attorneys' fees and the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection with any matter for which such llcp party is or may be entitled to indemnification hereunder. the company shall also indemnify each llcp party from and against any and all liabilities and costs incurred in connection with any claim or action brought to enforce such llcp party's rights under this section 2, or under applicable law or the company's charter or bylaws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification, or for recovery under directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the company, regardless of whether such llcp party is ultimately determined to be entitled to such indemnification or insurance recovery, as the case may be. if, for any reason, the foregoing indemnification is not available for any reason or is not sufficient to indemnify and hold the llcp parties harmless from all such liabilities and costs, then the company shall contribute to the amount of all such liabilities and costs paid or payable by any llcp party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and llcp, on the other hand, but also the relative fault of each, as well as any other equitable considerations. the company's reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations shall be in addition to any liability the company may otherwise have at law or under any other agreement, including, without limitation, the securities purchase agreement, and such obligations shall extend, upon the same terms, to all llcp parties. this section 2 shall survive indefinitely the termination of this agreement. 2.3 at any time that an llcp representative is serving on the board, the company shall have in place and shall maintain in force and effect one or more directors and officers liability insurance policies providing at least $10,000,000 in insurance coverage for director liability, including coverage for claims under federal and state securities laws. 3. co-sale agreement. 3.1 if one or more principal shareholders propose to sell or transfer any shares of common stock now owned or held by it or them ("co-sale shares") in any transaction (or series of related transactions) that does not constitute a public sale, then such principal shareholder or principal shareholders shall promptly notify the company and llcp in writing (the "co-sale notice") at least twenty (20) days prior to the closing of such proposed sale or transfer. the co-sale notice shall describe in reasonable detail the proposed sale or transfer, including, without limitation, the number of co-sale shares to be sold or transferred, the nature of such sale or transfer, the consideration to be paid and the name and address of each prospective purchaser or transferee. in the event that the sale or transfer is being made pursuant to the provisions of section 3.8, the notice shall state under which paragraph and subparagraph the sale or transfer is being made. for purposes of this agreement, the term "public sale" shall mean a sale, transfer or other disposition of common stock pursuant to - 5 - 6 rule 144 promulgated under the securities act or in a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act. it is acknowledged and understood that each principal shareholder may pledge his shares or transfer or "gift" his shares for estate planning purposes, provided that such shares continue to be subject to the provisions of this section 3. 3.2 llcp shall have the right, exercisable upon written notice to the principal shareholders within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the co-sale notice, to participate in such sale on the same terms and conditions as specified in the co-sale notice. to the extent that llcp exercises such right of participation in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this section 3, the number of co-sale shares that the principal shareholders may sell in the transaction(s) shall be correspondingly reduced. 3.3 if there shall be a decrease in the price to be paid by the proposed purchaser for the co-sale shares to be purchased from the price set forth in the co-sale notice, which decrease is acceptable to the principal shareholders, or any other material change in the terms or conditions set forth in the co-sale notice which are less favorable to the principal shareholders but which are acceptable to the principal shareholders, the principal shareholders shall immediately notify llcp in writing of such decrease or other change, and llcp shall have five (5) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice to modify the number of shares of common stock it will sell to the purchaser, as previously indicated in the written notice delivered by llcp pursuant to section 3.2. 3.4 llcp may sell all or any portion of that number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of common stock covered by the co-sale notice, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock or warrant shares, as applicable, owned by llcp at the time of the sale or transfer (collectively, the "llcp shares"), and the denominator of which is the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock owned by the principal shareholders and llcp at the time of the sale or transfer. in no event shall llcp be required to make any representation or warranty in connection with the sale to any prospective purchase other than as to the organization and authority of llcp, title to the shares of common stock to be sold by llcp and the absence of conflict with laws or material agreements of llcp. 3.5 llcp shall effect its participation in the sale by promptly delivering to the principal shareholders for transfer to the prospective purchaser one or more certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, which represent: (a) the type and number of shares of common stock which llcp elects to sell; or -6- 7 (b) that number of warrant shares which is at such time convertible into the number of shares of common stock which llcp elects to sell: provided, however, that if the prospective purchaser objects to the delivery of warrant shares in lieu of common stock, llcp shall convert such warrant shares into common stock and deliver common stock as provided in section 3.4(a). the company agrees to make any such conversion concurrent with the actual transfer of such shares to the purchaser. 3.6 the stock certificate or certificates that llcp delivers to the principal shareholders pursuant to section 3.4 shall be transferred to the prospective purchaser in consummation of the sale of the common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the co-sale notice, and the principal shareholders shall concurrently therewith remit to llcp by wire transfer in immediately available funds that portion of the sale proceeds to which llcp is entitled by reason of llcp's participation in such sale. to the extent that any prospective purchaser prohibits such assignment or otherwise refuses to purchase shares or other securities from llcp, the principal shareholders shall not sell to such prospective purchaser any shares of common stock unless and until, simultaneously with such sale, the principal shareholders shall purchase such shares or other securities from llcp. subject to the foregoing sentence, if the principal shareholders do not complete the proposed sale or transfer for any reason, the principal shareholders shall immediately return to llcp all documents (including,
