or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree, or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating

"exchange act"). item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. ------------------------------------------------- as more fully described herein, on february 23, 2000 (the "closing date"), the limited partnerships purchased (severally and not jointly), pursuant to the securities purchase agreement (i) an aggregate of 695,258 shares of the company's series a convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "preferred stock") and (ii) warrants (the "warrants") to purchase an aggregate of 291,933 shares of the company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $14,250,007.97 and rkb purchased 36,593 shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 15,365 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $750,010.13. neither the individuals listed on schedule i hereto nor any filing person hereunder beneficially owns any securities of the company other than those described above. the funds used by the limited partnerships to purchase the preferred stock and warrants were obtained by such entities from capital contributions by their partners and from the available funds of such entities. none of the individuals listed on schedule i hereto has contributed any funds or other consideration towards the purchase of the securities of the company except insofar as they may have partnership interests in any of the filing persons and have made capital contributions to any of the filing persons, as the case may be. item 4. purpose of transaction. ----------------------- 1. general ------- the purpose of the acquisition of the preferred stock and warrants by the limited partnerships was to acquire an equity interest in the company. the principal terms and conditions of the securities acquired by the limited partnerships and rkb are set forth in the certificate of designation for the shares of preferred stock, the warrant agreement providing for the issuance of the warrants and the securities purchase agreement. 2. terms of preferred stock ------------------------ dividends --------- under the terms of the certificate of designation which is filed as exhibit 3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference, so long as any shares of preferred stock remain outstanding, if the company pays a dividend (cash or otherwise) on shares of common stock, then at the same time the company is required to declare and pay a dividend on each share of preferred stock equal (in form and amount) to the dividend that would be payable on the shares of common stock into which such share of preferred stock may be converted on the record date for such dividends (or if no record date is established, at the date such dividend is declared). there are no other dividends payable with respect to the preferred stock. liquidation event ----------------- if the company shall liquidate, dissolve or wind-up (a "liquidation"), holders of preferred stock are entitled to receive for each share of preferred stock the greater of the liquidation preference (as defined below) as of the date of liquidation for such share and the amount the holder of such share of preferred stock would have received upon such liquidation if such shares were converted immediately prior to such liquidation into shares of common stock. the "liquidation preference" is $20.496 per share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such share) at the date of such issuance of the preferred stock (the "closing") plus an amount equal to dividends thereon which are deemed to cumulate and accrue from and after the date of issuance of such share at a rate of 8% per annum, compounded semi-annually on each six month anniversary after the closing date. other liquidation event ----------------------- if the company shall (i) dispose, lease or sell substantially all of its assets to any person, (ii) consummate a transaction, other than a public company liquidation event, as defined below, in which a person or group (as defined under sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the exchange act) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in rule 13d-3 and rule 13d-5 under the exchange act) of more than 50% of the voting power of the company or (iii) cause a recapitalization of the company involving an extraordinary distribution or dividend to the holders of common stock then the company is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding shares of preferred stock for an amount in cash per share of preferred stock equal to the greater of the (x) then current liquidation preference of the preferred stock and (y) the amount a holder of each share would be entitled to receive on a liquidation in respect of the aggregate number of shares of common stock into which such share of preferred stock is then convertible assuming that such transaction constitutes a liquidation for these purposes. if the company shall consummate a transaction which is the same as described in (ii) above and the consideration to be paid to the holders of common stock consists solely of common stock of a corporation which has an aggregate public float (as determined under the certificate of designation) of at least $250 million (a "public company liquidation event") and the shares of which are listed on a national exchange or freely tradeable without restrictions, then the company shall offer to repurchase all outstanding shares of preferred stock for an amount in cash per share of preferred stock equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred stock then in effect. conversion ---------- under the terms of the certificate of designation, the holders of preferred stock shall have the right following the closing date at any time in whole and from time to time in part, at such holder's option, to convert any or all outstanding shares of preferred stock into a number of shares of common stock, determined by dividing the liquidation preference as of the conversion date by $20.496, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. as a result of such conversion rights, the total shares of preferred stock issued to the limited partnerships on the closing date are convertible into 695,258 shares of common stock and, assuming the preferred stock is not earlier redeemed or converted, 1,302,205 shares of common stock on the eighth anniversary of the issue date. redemption ---------- under the terms of the certificate of designation, the company shall at any time following the first anniversary of the closing date, have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding shares of preferred stock within seventy (70) days following any date for which the market price per share of common stock for each of at least twenty (20) out of twenty-two (22) consecutive trading days preceding such date is equal to or greater than $40.992 (subject to appropriate adjustments). any such redemption must be effected for an amount in cash per share of preferred stock equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred stock then in effect. under the terms of the certificate of designation, the company shall, on the eighth anniversary of the closing date (such date, the "mandatory redemption date") redeem all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding shares of preferred stock. any such redemption must be effected for an amount in cash per share of preferred stock equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred stock then in effect as of the mandatory redemption date. 3. terms of warrants ----------------- pursuant to the warrant agreement, dated as of the closing date, among the company, rkb and the limited partnerships (the "warrant agreement"), the company issued warrants to the limited partnerships to purchase an aggregate of 291,933 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $22.448 per share (such exercise price will be adjusted in accordance with customary anti-dilution provisions). the warrant agreement permits the warrants to be exercised at any time in whole and from time to time in part during the term of the warrants with a cash payment to the company or cashlessly. the warrants will expire on the eighth anniversary of the closing date. 4. board representation; voting rights ----------------------------------- pursuant to the certificate of designation, and for so long as any of the preferred stock is outstanding, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock shall be entitled to designate one director for election to the board of directors of the company as a class i director and, voting separately as a series, shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of such designee to the board of directors for so long as the purchasers under the securities purchase agreement and their affiliates own in excess of the ownership threshold (as defined below). in the event the certificate of designation is no longer in effect, under the securities purchase agreement, from the closing date, and for so long as the purchasers and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate preferred stock, warrants and common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof representing greater than 15% of the common stock (assuming such conversion and exercise) acquired by the purchasers in the aggregate at the closing (and adjusting for stock splits, stock combinations and like transactions) (such ownership threshold referred to as the "ownership threshold"), twcp l.p. will continue to have the right to nominate one director (the "purchaser's designee") to the company's board of directors. the company will include such nominee in the slate of directors recommended by the company and will use reasonable efforts to secure the election of such nominee. on the closing date, mr. alan b. menkes, co-head of private equity of tw group and a member of the executive committee thereof, was appointed to the board of directors as the purchaser's designee. the purchaser's designee has the right to sit on all committees of the board of directors and mr. menkes was appointed to each of the audit committee and the compensation committee of the board of directors. in the event any purchaser's designee is not elected, then, at the request of twcp l.p., the appointment of the purchaser's designee or any other person designated by twcp l.p. shall serve as a non-voting observer (a "non-voting observer") to the board of directors of the company. the non-voting observer shall serve on the board of directors on as nearly equivalent basis as is possible (other than the right to vote) as would have been the case if the purchaser's designee had been elected to the board of directors. the purchaser's designee shall have the right to serve on the board of directors or as a non-voting observer until the purchasers and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate preferred stock, warrants and common stock less than the ownership threshold. so long as the purchasers and their affiliates own in excess of the ownership threshold, twcp l.p. shall have the right to consult with and advise management of the company on significant business issues. 5. by-laws amendment ----------------- pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the by-laws of the company were amended to require that the board of directors consist of eight directors for so long as required by the securities purchase agreement and to provide that for so long as the certificate of designation is in effect its provisions shall govern to the extent any provisions of the by-laws are inconsistent with the certificate of designation. 6. management stockholders agreements ---------------------------------- pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the limited partnerships and the company entered into a management stockholders agreement with each of mark k. ruport, steven m. johnson, james hale, thomas m. rafferty, mark r. fey and jeanne c. logozzo (each a "designated shareholder") which subject to certain exceptions provided therein, provides for from february 9, 2000 until august 9, 2000, except for mark ruport for whom such period shall extend from february 9, 2000 until february 9, 2001, the agreement of the designated stockholders not to transfer any shares of common stock (including upon exercise of options) held by them without the consent of the limited partnerships. this restriction on transfers will terminate automatically if the designated stockholder's employment with the company terminates. 7. other plans and proposals ------------------------- except as described above or otherwise described in this schedule 13d, neither the filing persons nor the other partnerships or the persons listed on schedule i currently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any transaction, event or action enumerated in the paragraphs of item 4 of the form of schedule 13d promulgated under the act. each of the filing persons expects to evaluate on an ongoing basis the company's financial condition, business, operations and prospects, the market price of the common stock, conditions in the securities markets generally, general economic and industry conditions and other factors. accordingly, each filing person reserves the right to change its plans and intentions at any time, as it deems appropriate. in particular, any one or more of filing persons (and their respective affiliates) may purchase additional shares of common stock, warrants or preferred stock or other securities of the company or may sell or transfer shares of common stock, warrants or preferred stock (or any of the shares of common stock into which such preferred stock is converted) beneficially owned by them from time to time in public or private transactions and/or may enter into privately negotiated derivative transactions with institutional counterparties to hedge the market risk of some or all of their positions in the shares of common stock, preferred stock or other securities and/or may cause any of the limited partnerships to distribute in kind to their respective partners or members, as the case may be, shares of common stock or preferred stock or other securities owned by such limited partnerships. to the knowledge of each filing person, each of the persons listed on schedule i hereto may make similar evaluations from time to time or on an ongoing basis and have similar reservations. item 5. interests in securities of the issuer. ------------------------------------- (a) based on the information disclosed by the company in the securities purchase agreement, as of february 8, 2000, there were 7,589,129 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. as of february 23, 2000, twcp l.p. beneficially owns 854,212 shares or 10.1% of common stock which represents the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred

partnerships are convertible or exercisable on the eighth anniversary of the issue date assuming that the preferred stock is not earlier converted or redeemed. twcp llc and tw group disclaim beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by the limited partnerships to the extent of the interests in the limited partnerships held by persons other than twcp llc and tw group and their affiliates. none of the filing persons or, to the knowledge of the filing persons, the other partnerships or the persons listed on schedule i hereto beneficially owns any shares of

vcoc. (a) section 4 of the certificate of designation provides that the holders of preferred stock and warrants shall be entitled to elect one director (the "preferred stock designee") to the board of directors of the company subject to the terms set forth therein. for so long as the purchasers and their affiliates, as holders of the preferred stock and warrants maintain ownership at the ownership threshold, shall have the right under this agreement and the certificate of designation to designate the preferred stock designee, twcp shall have the right, separately enforceable by it without further action required or permitted by any of the purchasers or their affiliates, to designate such preferred stock designee. (b) in the event the certificate of designation is no longer in effect, and so long as the purchasers and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate preferred stock, warrants and common shares issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof representing (and assuming conversion and exercise of all such preferred stock and warrants) greater than 15% of the common shares (assuming such conversion and exercise) acquired by the purchasers in the aggregate at the closing (and adjusting for stock splits, stock combinations and like transactions) (such ownership threshold referred to as the "ownership threshold"), twcp shall have the right to designate hereunder, at all times and from time to time, one director of the company (individuals designated pursuant to this paragraph, the "purchasers' designee"). in the event of a vacancy caused by the disqualification, removal, resignation or other cessation of service of any purchasers' designee from the board, the board shall elect as a director (to serve until the term of such purchaser designee would have expired) a new purchasers' designee who has been designated by twcp in an additional purchasers' designee notice that has been provided to the company at least seven (7) days prior the date of a regular meeting of the board. twcp shall nominate each purchasers' designee pursuant to an additional purchasers' designee notice in advance of each meeting of shareholders at which such purchasers' designee is to be elected. (c) twcp shall provide notice to the company (the "purchasers' designee notice") as required by section 4.6(a) above for each purchasers' designee, which notice shall contain the following information: (i) the name of the person it has designated to become director, and (ii) all information required by regulation 14a and schedule 14a under the exchange act with respect to each such purchasers' designee. subject to section 4.6(c) below, the purchasers' designee may be any person designated by twcp, including persons who are officers, directors or employees of the purchasers or their affiliates. (d) the company agrees to include the purchasers' designee to be added to or retained on the board pursuant to this agreement in the slate of nominees recommended by the board to the company's shareholders for election as director and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the election or reelection of a purchasers' designee to the board at each meeting of shareholders at which the purchasers' designee is up for election, including soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such persons, it being understood that efforts consistent with those used for other members of the slate recommended by the board shall be deemed reasonable. in the event that, notwithstanding the provisions of this section 4.6(d), the purchasers' designee is not elected to the board then, at the written request of twcp made within 30 days after the date of the shareholder meeting at which the purchasers' designee was not elected, the company shall cause, at the request of twcp, the appointment of the purchaser's designee or any other person designated by twcp, as a non-voting observer (a "non-voting observer") to the board of the company; it being understood that twcp may from time to time change the designation of such non-voting observer. the company shall afford to any purchasers' designee who serves as a non-voting observer, on as nearly equivalent basis as is possible (other than the right to vote) as would have been the case if the purchasers' designee had been elected to the board, the opportunity to meaningfully participate in, express views with respect to and have influence on the deliberations of the board, including through receipt, at the same time as the board receives the same, of all information and material as is distributed to the board. (e) so long as the purchasers and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate preferred stock, warrants and common shares exceeding the ownership threshold, without the prior written consent of twcp, the board of directors shall not amend the provisions of the by-laws of the company, as amended in accordance with section 5.2(x) specifying that the size of the entire board shall consist of eight members. (f) so long as the purchasers and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate preferred stock, warrants and common shares exceeding the ownership threshold, twcp shall have the right to consult with and advise management of the company on significant business issues, including finances and accounts of the company and management's proposed annual operating plans, and meet with management at the company's facilities at mutually agreeable times for such consultation and advice, including to review progress in achieving said plans subject to the execution of a mutually acceptable non-disclosure agreement. the company agrees to consider the advice given and any proposals made by twcp, provided the company should be under no obligation to accept or follow such advice. (g) the rights set forth in this section 4.6 are intended to satisfy the requirement of contractual management rights for purposes of qualifying twcp's interests in the company as venture capital investments for purposes of the department of labor's "plan assets" regulations, and in the event such rights are not satisfactory for such purpose as to twcp, the company and the purchasers shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to agree upon mutually satisfactory management rights which satisfy such regulations. (h) unless otherwise agreed by the company, the purchasers shall cause the purchasers' designee then serving on the board or as a non-voting observer to resign from the board or as a non-voting observer immediately at any time after the purchasers and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate preferred stock, warrants and common shares less than the ownership threshold. 4.7. committees. (a) the preferred stock designee or purchaser's designee, as the case may be, shall be granted representation (as of the closing date) on all board committees, including the audit and compensation committees. in the event that a non-voting observer is serving on the board as the representative for the purchasers, such non-voting observer shall be afforded, on as nearly equivalent basis as is possible (other than the right to vote) the opportunity to meaningfully participate in and express views with respect to the deliberations of the committees. (b) the board will not establish an executive committee authorized to exercise the power of the board generally unless the purchasers are granted representation on such committee proportional to its representation on the board, nor will the board establish or employ committees (unless the purchasers are granted proportional representation thereon) as a means designed to circumvent or having the effect of circumventing the rights of the purchasers under this agreement to representation on the board. 4.8. certificate of designation. the company shall, prior to or concurrently with the closing, cause the certificate of designation to be filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware as set forth in the form of the certificate of designation attached hereto as exhibit 2.2. 4.9. cooperation. each of the purchasers and the company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, as promptly as practicable all such further actions as shall be necessary to make effective and consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement. 4.10. covenants to provide information. the company covenants and agrees with each purchaser that so long as the purchasers and their affiliates own in the aggregate preferred shares, warrants and common shares in excess of the ownership threshold, the company shall deliver to each purchaser: (a) within 45 days after the end of each quarterly fiscal period, (i) unaudited balance sheets and an income statement as of the end of such period, together with statements of retained earnings and cash flow for such period ("quarterly financials"), together with such analysis and comparisons to budget as are routinely provided to the board.

(d) if for any period the company shall have any subsidiary or subsidiaries whose accounts are consolidated with those of the company, then, in respect of such period, the financial statements and information delivered pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section 4.10 shall be the consolidated and consolidating financial statements of the company and all such consolidated subsidiaries. (e) at least 30 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, an annual budget for the company for such fiscal year (displaying anticipated statements of income and cash flows and balance sheets), and promptly upon preparation thereof any other significant budgets prepared by the company and any revisions of such annual budget. (f) promptly (but in any event within ten business days) after the discovery or receipt of notice of (i) any default under any material agreement to which the company and/or any of its subsidiaries is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any other event which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, or business of the company or any of its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the filing of any material litigation against the company or any of its subsidiaries a statement certified by a senior executive officer of the company specifying the nature and period of existence thereof and what actions the company has taken and proposes to take with respect thereto. (g) with reasonable promptness, such other information and financial data concerning the company as the purchasers may reasonably request. 4.11. reserve shares. the company will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery upon conversion of the preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants, the number of shares of common stock from time to time issuable upon conversion of all shares of the preferred stock and exercise of the warrants at the time outstanding. all common shares issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants shall be duly authorized and, when issued upon such conversion or exercise, shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 4.12. notice of breach. from the date hereof through the closing, as promptly as practicable, and in any event not later than two business days after senior management of the company becomes aware thereof, the company shall provide the purchasers with written notice of (a) any representation or warranty of the company contained in this agreement or any other transaction document being untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the closing, or (b) any failure of the company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by the company under this agreement or any other transaction document. 4.13. transfer taxes. the company shall be responsible for liability with respect to any transfer, stamp or similar taxes which may be payable in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this agreement including, without limitation, any such taxes with respect to the issuance of the preferred stock, the warrants or the common shares. 4.14. indemnification. so long as a preferred designee is a director, except for amendments or modifications required by law, the company shall not amend or modify any rights to indemnification now existing in favor of the present and former directors, officers or employees of the company and its subsidiaries provided in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the company or any subsidiary in a manner adverse to any such director, officer or employee, and the company shall maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance carrying the directors of the company with coverage no less favorable than presently in effect. 4.15. use of proceeds. the proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock and warrants shall be used for general corporate purposes as shall be determined by the board of directors. 4.16. registration rights agreement. the company will use its reasonable best efforts prior to closing to amend and restate the registration rights agreement and the amended and restated registration rights agreement, dated may 6, 1996, as amended (the "existing rights agreement"), so that all of the registrable securities under both agreements are covered by a single agreement, the terms of which are approved by the mutual consent of the company and the requisite holders of registrable securities under each of the registration rights agreement and the existing rights agreement. 4.17. future issuances. the company agrees that it shall be a condition of its issuance of any additional common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock) pursuant to any employee benefit plan (other than the issuance of additional shares of common stock upon exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof) that the person receiving such securities, if after receipt thereof such person beneficially owns in excess of 1% of the outstanding shares, to agree not to effect any public sale or distribution of equity securities of the company, including any public sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the period commencing thirty days prior to and ending 90 days after the effective date of any underwritten demand registration or any underwritten piggyback registration under the registration rights agreement. article v conditions 5.1. conditions to obligations of the purchasers and the company. the respective obligations of the purchasers and the company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the closing of each of the following conditions: (i) no statute, rule or regulation or order of any court or administrative agency shall be in effect which prohibits the consummation of the transactions to be consummated at the closing; (ii) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the hsr act applicable to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have expired or been terminated; and (iii) any material required filings or consents set forth on schedule 5.1(iii), if any, shall have been made or obtained. 5.2. conditions to obligations of the purchasers.

(d) whenever the distribution provided for in this section 3 shall be payable in securities or property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such securities or property. section 4. voting rights. in addition to any voting rights provided by law, the holders of shares of series a preferred stock shall have the voting rights set forth in this section 4: (a) (i) right to vote as a single class with holders of common stock. so long as any of the series a preferred stock is outstanding, each share of series a preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the corporation, voting together as a single class with the holders of common stock. the holders of each share of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to vote with respect to each share of series a preferred stock held by each such holder a number of votes equal to the number of votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of series a preferred stock is then convertible on the record date for such vote without such holder being required to convert such shares. fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregation of all shares of common stock into which shares of series a preferred stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward). (ii) right to elect a director. on the issue date, the board of directors shall cause the total number of directors then constituting the whole board of directors to be fixed at eight. the holders of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to designate one director for election to the board of directors of the corporation as a class i director and, voting separately as a series, shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of such designee to the board of directors for so long as the purchasers under the securities purchase agreement and their affiliates own in excess of the ownership threshold (as defined in the securities purchase agreement). any such designee may be removed with or without cause by the holders of the series a preferred stock. (iii) no right to class vote on certain transactions. subject to the rights of holders of shares of series a preferred stock set forth in sections 4(a)(i), 8 and 10, the corporation may, without the consent of any holder of series a preferred stock, consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets as an entirety to, any person, provided that: (a) the successor, transferee or lessee (if not the corporation) is organized and existing under the laws of the united states of america or any state thereof or the district of columbia and the series a preferred stock shall be converted into or exchanged for and shall become shares of, or interests in, such successor, transferee or lessee, having in respect of such successor, transferee, or lessee substantially the same powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, that the series a preferred stock has immediately prior to such transaction; and (b) the corporation delivers to the transfer agent an officers' certificate and provides reasonable evidence that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease complies with this certificate of designation. in the event of any consolidation or merger or conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation that is permitted pursuant to this subparagraph (iii), the successor resulting from such consolidation or into which the corporation is merged or the transferee or lessee to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made, will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the corporation with respect to the series a preferred stock (or the shares or interests into, or for which, the series a preferred stock is converted or exchanged), and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor (if still in existence) shall be released from its obligations and covenants with respect to the series a preferred stock. (b) actions not to be taken without vote of holders of series a preferred stock. so long as any shares of series a preferred stock are outstanding, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of series a preferred stock outstanding at the time of such vote shall be required in order to: (i) authorize, increase the authorized number of shares of, or issue (including on conversion, exercise or exchange of any convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities or by reclassification) (a) any shares of any class or classes or series within a class of the corporation's capital stock ranking prior to (either as to dividends or upon liquidation) the series a preferred stock, or (b) any parity stock; (ii) increase the authorized number of shares of, or issue (including on conversion, exercise or exchange of any convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities or by reclassification) any shares of, series a preferred stock other than as authorized by this certificate of designation; or (iii) reclassify any shares of series a preferred stock or authorize, adopt or approve an amendment to the certificate of incorporation or this certificate of designation which would increase or decrease the par value of the shares of series a preferred stock, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the series a preferred stock. (c) exercise of voting rights. (i) the foregoing rights of holders of shares of series a preferred stock to take any actions (a) as provided in section 4(a)(i) may be exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders held for such purpose or at any adjournment thereof and (b) as provided in sections 4(a)(ii) and 4(b) may be exercised at any annual meeting of holders of series a preferred stock or at a special meeting of holders of series a preferred stock held for such purpose or at any adjournment thereof. the chairman of the board of the corporation may call, and if the holders of series a preferred stock are to vote separately as a single class, upon the written request of holders of record of 20% of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, addressed to the secretary of the corporation, at the principal office of the corporation, the chairman of the board of the corporation shall call, a special meeting of the holders of shares of series a preferred stock entitled to vote as provided herein. the corporation shall use its best efforts to hold such meeting within 10, but in any event not later than 20, days after delivery of such request to the secretary, upon the notice specified by the requesting holders of series a preferred stock or if not so specified as provided by law and in the by-laws of the corporation for the holding of meetings of stockholders. (ii) at each meeting of stockholders at which the holders of shares of series a preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately as a single class, to take any action, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of one-half of the total number of shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. at any such meeting or at any adjournment thereof, in the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of series a preferred stock, a majority of the holders of such shares present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the meeting as to the actions to be taken by the holders of shares of series a preferred stock from time to time and place to place without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a quorum shall be present. (iii) for the taking of any action as provided in sections 4(a)(ii) or 4(b) by the holders of shares of series a preferred stock, each such holder shall have one vote for each share of such stock standing in his name on the transfer books of the corporation as of any record date fixed for such purpose or, if no such date be fixed, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. section 5. restrictions on distributions in respect of common stock. (a) for so long as any shares of series a preferred stock shall remain outstanding, (a) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any default by the corporation in respect of its obligations in favor of any holders of the series a preferred stock, including any obligation to redeem shares of series a preferred stock under section 5 or repurchase shares of series a preferred stock under section 10 and (b) from the date of an other liquidation event or public company liquidation event to the other liquidation event payment date, the corporation shall not declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions, whether in cash, securities or other property, upon, nor shall the corporation redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of parity stock or junior stock, other than the repurchase of shares of capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock of the corporation held by directors or employees of the corporation pursuant to employee benefit plans approved by the board of directors. (b) the corporation shall not permit any subsidiaries of the corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of capital stock of the corporation unless the corporation could, pursuant to clause (a) of this section 5, purchase such shares at such time and in such manner. section 6. redemption. (a) optional redemption. (i) subject to the rights of holders of shares of series a preferred stock set forth in section 8 hereof, the corporation shall, at any time following the first anniversary of the issue date, have the right, at its sole option and election made in accordance with clause (a)(ii) below, to redeem, to the extent the corporation shall have the funds legally available therefor, all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding shares of series a preferred stock within 70 days following any date (the "redemption trigger date") on which the market price per share of common stock for each of at least 20 out of 22 consecutive trading days immediately preceding such date is equal to or greater than $40.992 (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock dividends, splits, combinations and similar events affecting the common stock) (the "trigger price") for an amount in cash per share of series a preferred stock equal to the liquidation preference of such share (the "optional redemption price") as of the optional redemption date (as defined below). (ii) notice of any redemption of shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to clause (a)(i) shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of shares of series a preferred stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the corporation, specifying (x) the optional redemption price and (y) the redemption date (the "optional redemption date"); and calling upon such holder to surrender to the corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, such holder's certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the "optional redemption notice"). the optional redemption notice shall be mailed not more than 35 days following the applicable redemption trigger date. the optional redemption date shall be determined by the corporation but in no event shall be earlier than the 10th day following the date of receipt by the holders of series a preferred stock of the redemption notice or later than the 35th day following the redemption notice. the redemption notice shall be revocable by the corporation by notice to the holders of series a preferred stock received by such holders on or prior to the fifth business day prior to the optional redemption date. (b) mandatory redemption. (i) subject to the rights of holders of shares of series a preferred stock set forth in section 8 hereof, the corporation shall, on the eighth anniversary of the issue date (such date, the "mandatory redemption date"), redeem, to the extent the corporation shall have the funds legally available therefor, all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding shares of series a preferred stock for an amount in cash per share of series a preferred stock equal to the liquidation preference of such share (the "mandatory redemption price") as of the mandatory redemption date. if the funds of the corporation legally available for redemption of shares of series a preferred stock on the mandatory redemption date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon the number of shares of series a preferred stock held by each such holder. the shares of series a preferred stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided in this certificate of designation at any time. thereafter, when sufficient additional funds of the corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of series a preferred stock that remain outstanding, such funds shall immediately be used to redeem the entire balance of the shares of series a preferred stock that the corporation has become obliged to redeem on the mandatory redemption date but which the corporation has not redeemed. (ii) notice of any redemption of shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to clause (b)(i) shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of shares of series a preferred stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the corporation, specifying (x) the number of shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed, (y) the mandatory redemption price and (z) the mandatory redemption date; and calling upon such holder to surrender to the corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, such holder's certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the "mandatory redemption notice"). the mandatory redemption notice shall be mailed not less than 25 and not more than 45 days prior to the mandatory redemption date. (c) payment of redemption price. on the date of any redemption pursuant to this section 6, (i) the corporation shall pay, in cash or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by each holder, the optional redemption price or the mandatory redemption price, as the case may be, for each of its shares of series a preferred stock, and (ii) after payment has been made in accordance with clause (i) above, all rights of the holders thereof as holders of series a preferred stock of the corporation shall cease. section 7. status of converted or redeemed stock. any shares of series a preferred stock converted, redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. all such shares of series a preferred stock shall upon their cancellation, and upon the filing of any document required by the dgcl, become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, of the corporation and may be reissued as part of another series of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, of the corporation. section 8. conversion. (a) right to convert. subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the holders of series a preferred stock shall have the right following the issue date at any time in whole and from time to time in part, at such holder's option, to convert any or all outstanding shares (and fractional shares) of series a preferred stock into common stock as set forth hereinafter. each share of series a preferred stock shall be convertible into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing the liquidation preference as of the conversion date by the conversion price as of the conversion date. the conversion price shall be the initial conversion price (as defined in paragraph (e) below) as adjusted in accordance with clauses (f) and (g) of this section 8. (b) mechanics of conversion. conversion of the series a preferred stock may be effected by any such holder upon the surrender to the corporation at the principal office of the corporation or at the office of any agent or agents of the corporation, as may be designated by the board of directors of the corporation (the "transfer agent"), of the certificate(s) for such series a preferred stock to be converted, accompanied by a written notice (the date of such notice being referred to as the "conversion date") stating that such holder elects to convert all or a specified whole number of such shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 8 and specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued. in case any holder's notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of common stock in such name or names. other than such taxes, the corporation will pay any and all transfer, issue, stamp and other taxes (other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of series a preferred stock pursuant hereto. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of such certificate or certificates and the receipt of such notice relating thereto and, if applicable, payment of all transfer taxes which are the responsibility of the holder as set forth above (or the demonstration to the satisfaction of the corporation that such taxes have been paid), the corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i) certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of common stock, to which the holder of shares of series a preferred stock being converted shall be entitled and (ii) if less than the full number of shares of series a preferred stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or certificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares evidenced by such surrendered certificate or certificates less the number of shares being converted. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the conversion date so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the shares being converted shall cease except for the rights pursuant to section 8(c) to receive shares of common stock, in accordance herewith, and payment for any fractional share and the person entitled to receive the shares of common stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of common stock at such time. in case any shares of series a preferred stock are to be redeemed pursuant to section 6, such right of conversion shall continue in effect through the close of business on the business day preceding the applicable redemption date and thereafter shall cease and terminate as to the shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed unless the corporation shall default in making payment of the amount payable upon such redemption. (c) fractional shares. in connection with the conversion of any shares of series a preferred stock into common stock, no fractions of shares of common stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the market price per share of common stock on the trading day on which such shares of series a preferred stock are deemed to have been converted. if more than one share of series a preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of common stock issuable on conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the total number of shares of series a preferred stock so surrendered. promptly upon conversion, the corporation shall pay to the holder of shares of series a preferred stock so converted, out of funds legally available, an amount in cash, or by wire transfer of same day funds, in lieu of any fractional interest of such holder. (d) reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock, free from any preemptive rights, such number of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock issued pursuant to this certificate of designation into common stock, and shall take all actions required to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock if necessary to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock. (e) initial conversion price. the initial conversion price shall equal $20.496 (the "initial conversion price"). (f) (i) adjustment to conversion price for stock dividends and for combinations or subdivisions of common stock. (i) in case the corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the issue date (a) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, (b) subdivide or split the outstanding shares of common stock, (c) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares or (d) issue by reclassification of the shares of common stock any shares of capital stock of the corporation, then, and in each such case, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier, shall be adjusted so that the holder of any shares of series a preferred stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock or other securities of the corporation which after the happening of any of the events described above such shares of series a preferred stock would have been entitled had such shares of series a preferred stock been surrendered for conversion immediately prior to the happening of such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall become effective (x) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or (y) in the case of such subdivision, split, reclassification or combination, at the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever an event listed above shall occur. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (i) in connection with any transaction to which clause (g) applies. (ii) in case the corporation shall issue shares of common stock (or rights, warrants or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock) (collectively, "additional shares") after the issue date at a price per share (or having a conversion or exercise price per share) less than the current market price as of the date of issuance of such shares (or, in the case of convertible or exchangeable securities, less than the current market price as of the date of issuance of the rights, warrants or other securities in respect of which shares of common stock were issued), then, and in each such case, the conversion price shall be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying (a) the conversion price in effect on the day immediately prior to the date of issuance of such additional shares by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issue multiplied by the then applicable current market price per share and (2) the aggregate consideration receivable by the corporation for the total number of shares of common stock so issued (or into or for which the rights, warrants or other convertible securities may convert or be exercisable or exchangeable), and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issue and (y) the number of additional shares issued (or into or for which the rights, warrants or convertible securities may be converted, exercised or exchanged), multiplied by the current market price. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be made on the next business day following the date on which any such issuance is made and shall be effective retroactively to the close of business on the date of such issuance of additional shares. for purposes of this clause (ii), the aggregate consideration receivable by the corporation in connection with the issuance of shares of common stock or of rights, warrants or convertible securities shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the aggregate offering price (before deduction of underwriting discounts or commissions and expenses payable to third parties) of all such common stock, rights, warrants and convertible securities plus the aggregate amount (as determined on the date of issuance), if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such rights, warrants and convertible securities into shares of common stock. if, subsequent to the date of issuance of such right, warrants or other convertible securities, the exercise or conversion price thereof is reduced, such aggregate amount shall be recalculated and the conversion price shall be adjusted retroactively to give effect to such reduction. on the expiration of any option or the termination of any right to convert or exchange any securities into additional shares, the conversion price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to the conversion price which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination (but taking into account other adjustments made following the time of issuance of such securities) had such security, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued. in case any portion of the consideration to be received by the corporation shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such non-cash consideration shall be utilized in the foregoing computation. if common stock is sold as a unit with other securities, the aggregate consideration received for such common stock shall be deemed to be net of the fair market value of such other securities. the issuance or reissuance of (i) any shares of common stock or rights, warrants or other securities convertible into shares of common stock (whether treasury shares or newly issued shares) (a) pursuant to a dividend or distribution on, or subdivision, split, combination or reclassification of, the outstanding shares of common stock requiring an adjustment in the conversion price pursuant to clause (i) of this clause (f); (b) pursuant to any restricted stock or stock option plan or stock purchase program of the corporation involving the grant of options or rights to acquire common stock to directors, officers and employees and, in the case of options, consultants and service providers, of the corporation and its subsidiaries so long as (x) the granting of such options or rights has been approved by the board of directors and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable by the corporation in connection with such options shall be no less than fair market value, as determined by the board of directors, and in connection with such rights under the employee stock purchase plan of the corporation shall be no less than 85% of the fair market value, as determined by the board of directors, in each case of the common stock underlying such options or rights on the date of grant; (c) pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or convertible security outstanding as of the issue date, or (ii) the series a preferred stock and the warrants issuable pursuant to the securities purchase agreement and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof, shall not be deemed to constitute an issuance of common stock or convertible securities by the corporation to which this clause (f)(ii) applies; provided that, notwithstanding clause (i)(c), the conversion price shall be appropriately reduced to the extent that the number of shares into which any such security may be converted, exercised or exchanged is increased or the price therefor is reduced after the issue date. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (f)(ii) in connection with any transaction to which clause (g) applies. (iii) in case the corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance on a pro rata basis of rights, options or warrants to the holders of its common stock (or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock) entitling such holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock) at a price per share of common stock (or having a conversion, exercise or exchange price per share of common stock, in the case of a security convertible into, or exerciseable or exchangeable for, shares of common stock) less than the current market price on such record date, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants (or conversion of such convertible securities) shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding as of such record date and the conversion price shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph 8(f)(ii) hereof, as though such maximum number of shares of common stock had been so issued for an aggregate consideration payable by the holders of such rights, options, warrants or other securities prior to their receipt of such shares of common stock. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued or expire in whole or in part unexercised, or in the event of a change in the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options or warrants are entitled (other than pursuant to adjustment provisions therein comparable to those contained in this paragraph 8(f)), the conversion price shall again be adjusted as follows: (a) in the event that all of such rights, options or warrants expire unexercised, the conversion price shall be the conversion price that would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed; (b) in the event that less than all of such rights, options or warrants expire unexercised, the conversion price shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph 8(f)(ii) to reflect the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants that remain outstanding (without taking into effect shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of rights, options or warrants that have lapsed or expired); and (c) in the event of a change in the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options or warrants are entitled, the conversion price shall be adjusted to reflect the conversion price which would then be in effect if such holder had initially been entitled to such changed number of shares of common stock. notwithstanding the foregoing, in case the corporation shall issue rights, options or warrants ("stockholder rights") to all holders of its common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock, which rights or warrants (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock, (ii) are not exercisable and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common stock, in each case in clauses (i) through (iii) until the occurrence of a specified event or event ("trigger event"), such stockholder rights shall for purposes of this clause (iii) not be deemed issued or distributed until the occurrence of the earliest trigger event and the conversion price shall not be reduced until the occurrence of such earliest trigger event. (iv) in case the corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of any class of common stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the continuing corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, assets or other property, the conversion price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, (a) the numerator of which shall be the conversion price immediately prior to such distributions less the fair market value of the portion of the assets, other property or evidence of indebtedness so to be distributed which is applicable to one share of common stock and (b) the denominator of which shall be the conversion price immediately prior to such distributions. such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the conversion price shall again be adjusted to be the conversion price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. an adjustment to the conversion price also shall be made in respect of dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash to all holders of any class of common stock (excluding any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, and any cash that is distributed upon a merger, consolidation or other transaction for which an adjustment pursuant to paragraph 8(g) is made) or in the case where the corporation effects any repurchase of its common stock where the sum of (1) all such cash dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months in respect of which no adjustment has been made and (2) any cash and the fair market value of other consideration paid in respect of any repurchases of common stock by the corporation or any of its subsidiaries within the preceding 12 months in respect of which no adjustment has been made, exceeds 5% of the corporation's market capitalization (being the product of the then current market price of the common stock times the aggregate number of shares of common stock then outstanding on the record date for such distribution). the conversion price to be in effect after such adjustment shall be determined by subtracting from the conversion price in effect prior to such adjustment an amount equal to the quotient of (a) the sum of clause (1) and clause (2) above and (b) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date such adjustment is to be determined. (v) the term "dividend," as used in this clause (f), shall mean a dividend or other distribution upon the capital stock of the corporation. (vi) anything in this clause (f) to the contrary notwithstanding, the corporation shall not be required to give effect to any adjustment in the conversion price (x) if, in connection with any event which would otherwise require an adjustment pursuant to this clause (f), the holders of series a preferred stock have received the dividend or distribution to which such holders are entitled under section 2 hereof or (y) unless and until the net effect of one or more adjustments (each of which shall be carried forward), determined as above provided, shall have resulted in a change of the conversion price such that the number of shares of common stock receivable upon conversion of each share of series a preferred stock would differ by at least one two-hundredth of one share of common stock, and when the cumulative net effect of more than one adjustment so determined shall be to change the conversion price by at least one two-hundredth of one share of common stock, such change in conversion price shall thereupon be given effect. all calculations under this section 8 shall be made to the nearest four decimal points. (vii) the certificate of any firm of independent public accountants of recognized national standing selected by the board of directors of the corporation (which may be the firm of independent public accountants regularly employed by the corporation) shall be presumptively correct for any computation made under this clause (f). (viii) if the corporation shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the right of conversion granted by this clause (f) or in the conversion price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

of any jurisdiction. such securities may not be offered, sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, encumbered, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to (i) a registration statement with respect to such securities that is effective under such act or applicable state securities law, or (ii) any exemption from registration under such act, or applicable state securities law, relating to the disposition of securities, including rule 144 provided, if so requested by the company, an opinion of counsel is furnished to the company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company, to the effect that an exemption from the registration requirements of the act and/or applicable state securities law is available. prior to any transfer or attempted transfer of any warrants, the holder of such warrants shall give 10 days' prior written notice (a "transfer notice") to the company of such holder's intention to effect such transfer, describing the manner and circumstances of

may be effected without registration under the securities act. after receipt of the transfer notice and opinion, the company shall, within five days thereof, so notify the holder of such warrants and such holder shall thereupon, subject to compliance with the other restrictions on transfer contained herein, be entitled to transfer such warrants, in accordance with the terms of the transfer notice. each warrant issued upon such transfer shall bear the restrictive legends set forth above, unless, in the opinion of counsel to such holder (which opinion must be reasonably satisfactory to the company and its counsel), such legend is not required in order to ensure compliance with the securities act. the holder of the warrants giving the transfer notice shall not be entitled to transfer such warrants until receipt of notice from the company under this section 6. section 7. terms of warrants; exercise of warrants. subject to the terms of this agreement, the warrants may be exercised at any time after the date hereof in whole and from time to time in part until 5:00 p.m. (et) on february 23, 2008 (the "expiration date"). each warrant, when exercised in accordance with the terms hereof and upon payment in cash of the exercise price of $22.448 per share (the "exercise price") will entitle the holder thereof to acquire from the company (and the company shall issue to such holder of a warrant) one fully paid and nonassessable share of the company's authorized but unissued common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in section 11). no cash dividend shall be paid to a holder of warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants unless such holder was, as of the record date for the declaration of such dividend, the record holder of such warrant shares. a warrant may be exercised upon surrender to the company at the register office of the certificate or certificates evidencing the warrants to be exercised with the form of election to purchase on the reverse thereof duly filled in and signed, together with payment to the company of the exercise price for each warrant share then exercised. in lieu of payment of the exercise price pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the warrant holder shall have the right to require the company to convert the warrants, in whole or in part and at any time or times (the "conversion right"), into shares of common stock by surrendering to the company the certificate or certificates evidencing the warrant to be converted with the form of notice of conversion on the reverse thereof duly filled in and signed. upon exercise of the conversion right, the company shall deliver to the warrant holder (without payment by the holder of the warrant of any exercise price) that number of shares of common stock which is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the value of the number of warrants being exercised at the time the warrants are exercised (determined by subtracting the aggregate exercise price for all such warrants immediately prior to the exercise of the warrants from the aggregate current market price (as defined in section 11) of that number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of such warrants immediately prior to the exercise of the warrants (taking into account all applicable adjustments pursuant to section 11) by (y) the current market price of one share of common stock immediately prior to the exercise of the warrants. subject to the provisions of section 8 hereof, upon surrender of the warrant certificate or certificates, the company shall issue and deliver with all reasonable dispatch, to or upon the written order of the warrant holder and in such name or names as the warrant holder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the number of warrant shares issuable or other securities or property to which such holder is entitled hereunder upon the exercise of such warrants, including, at the company's option, any cash payable in lieu of fractional interests as provided in section 12 hereof. such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such warrant shares as of the date of the surrender of such warrants and payment of the exercise price. the company may issue fractional shares of common stock upon exercise of any warrants in accordance with section 12 hereof. the warrants shall be exercisable on or prior to the expiration date, at the election of the holders thereof, either at any time in whole or from time to time in part (in whole shares) and, in the event that a certificate evidencing warrants is exercised in respect of fewer than all of the warrant shares issuable on exercise of such certificate at any time prior to the expiration date, a new certificate evidencing the remaining warrant or warrants will be issued, and the company will duly execute and deliver the required new warrant certificate or certificates pursuant to the provisions of section 4 and this section 7. all warrant certificates surrendered upon exercise of warrants shall be canceled by the company. such canceled warrant certificates shall then be disposed of in a manner satisfactory to the company and in accordance with any applicable law. the company shall account promptly in writing with respect to warrants exercised and all monies received for the purchase of the warrant shares through the exercise of such warrants. in the event that the company shall purchase or otherwise acquire warrants, the company may elect to have the warrants canceled and retired. the company shall keep copies of this agreement and any notices given or received hereunder available for inspection by the registered warrant holders during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice at the register office. section 8. payment of taxes. the company will pay all taxes and other governmental charges attributable to the initial issuance of warrant shares upon the exercise of warrants; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay any such taxes or charges which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue of any warrant certificates or any certificates for warrant shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of a warrant certificate surrendered upon the exercise of a warrant, and the company shall not be required to issue or deliver such warrant certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the company the amount of such taxes or charges or shall have established to the satisfaction of the company that such taxes or charges have been paid. section 9. mutilated or missing warrant certificates. in case any of the warrant certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the company may in its discretion issue in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated warrant certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the warrant certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new warrant certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent number of warrants, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of such loss, theft or destruction of such warrant certificate and indemnity and security therefor, if requested, also reasonably satisfactory to the company. applicants for such substitute warrant certificates shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the company may prescribe. section 10. reservations of warrant shares. the company (i) shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued common stock, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue warrant shares upon exercise of warrants, the maximum number of shares of common stock which would then be deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding warrants if all such outstanding warrants were then exercisable and (ii) shall not take any action which results in any adjustment of the number of warrant shares if the total number of warrant shares issuable after the action upon the exercise of all of the warrant shares would exceed the total number of shares of common stock then authorized by the company's certificate of incorporation and available for the purpose of issue upon such exercise. the transfer agent for the preferred stock (which may be the company if it is acting as transfer agent) (the "transfer agent") and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. the company will keep a copy of this agreement on file with the transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the warrants. the company will supply such transfer agent with duly executed stock certificates for purposes of honoring all outstanding warrants upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this agreement and the company will provide or otherwise make available any cash which may be payable as provided in section 12 hereof. the company will furnish such transfer agent a copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto which are transmitted to each warrant holder pursuant to section 13 hereof. the company covenants that all warrant shares which may be issued upon exercise of warrants have been duly authorized and will, upon payment of the exercise price or upon the exercise of the conversion right and issuance, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests with respect to the issue thereof. section 11. adjustment of number of warrant shares. (a) initial exercise. each warrant will initially be exercisable by the holder thereof into one share of common stock at the exercise price. (b) adjustment to exercise price for stock dividends and for combinations or subdivisions of common stock. (i) in case the company shall at any time or from time to time after the closing date (a) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, (b) subdivide or split the outstanding shares of common stock, (c) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares or (d) issue by reclassification of the shares of common stock any shares of capital stock of the company, then, and in each such case, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier, shall be adjusted so that the holder of any warrants thereafter exercised shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock or other securities of the company which after the happening of any of the events described above such warrants would have been exercisable had such warrants been exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall become effective (x) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or (y) in the case of such subdivision, split, reclassification or combination, at the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever an event listed above shall occur. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (i) in connection with any transaction to which clause (c) applies. (ii) in case the company shall issue shares of common stock (or rights, warrants or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock) (collectively, "additional shares") after the closing date at a price per share (or having a conversion or exercise price per share) less than the current market price as of the date of issuance of such shares (or, in the case of convertible or exchangeable securities, less than the current market price as of the date of issuance of the rights, warrants or other securities in respect of which shares of common stock were issued), then, and in each such case, the exercise price shall be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying (a) the exercise price in effect on the day immediately prior to the date of issuance of such additional shares by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issue multiplied by the then applicable current market price per share and (2) the aggregate consideration receivable by the company for the total number of shares of common stock so issued (or into or for which the rights, warrants or other convertible securities may convert or be exercisable or exchangeable), and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issue and (y) the number of additional shares issued (or into or for which the rights, warrants or convertible securities may be converted, exercised or exchanged), multiplied by the current market price. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be made on the next business day following the date on which any such issuance is made and shall be effective retroactively to the close of business on the date of such issuance of additional shares. for purposes of this clause (ii), the aggregate consideration receivable by the company in connection with the issuance of shares of common stock or of rights, warrants or convertible securities shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the aggregate offering price (before deduction of underwriting discounts or commissions and expenses payable to third parties) of all such common stock, rights, warrants and convertible securities plus the aggregate amount (as determined on the date of issuance), if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such rights, warrants and convertible securities into shares of common stock. if, subsequent to the date of issuance of such right, warrants or other convertible securities, the exercise or conversion price thereof is reduced, such aggregate amount shall be recalculated and the exercise price shall be adjusted retroactively to give effect to such reduction. on the expiration of any option or the termination of any right to convert or exchange any securities into additional shares, the exercise price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to the exercise price which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination (but taking into account other adjustments made following the time of issuance of such securities) had such security, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued. in case any portion of the consideration to be received by the company shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such non-cash consideration shall be utilized in the foregoing computation. if common stock is sold as a unit with other securities, the aggregate consideration received for such common stock shall be deemed to be net of the fair market value of such other securities. the issuance or reissuance of (i) any shares of common stock or rights, warrants or other securities convertible into shares of common stock (whether treasury shares or newly issued shares) (a) pursuant to a dividend or distribution on, or subdivision, split, combination or reclassification of, the outstanding shares of common stock requiring an adjustment in the exercise price pursuant to clause (i) of this clause (b); (b) pursuant to any restricted stock or stock option plan or stock purchase program of the company involving the grant of options or rights to acquire common stock to directors, officers and employees and, in the case of options, consultants and service providers, of the company and its subsidiaries so long as (x) the granting of such options or rights has been approved by the board of directors and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable by the company in connection with such options shall be no less than fair market value, as determined by the board of directors, and in connection with such rights under the employee stock purchase plan of the corporation shall be no less than 85% of the fair market value, as determined by the board of directors, of the common stock underlying such options or rights on the date of grant; (c) pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or convertible security outstanding as of the closing date, or (ii) the series a preferred stock issuable pursuant to the purchase agreement and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof, shall not be deemed to constitute an issuance of common stock or convertible securities by the company to which this clause (b)(ii) applies; provided that, notwithstanding clause (i)(c), the exercise price shall be appropriately reduced to the extent that the number of shares into which any such security may be converted, exercised or exchanged is increased or the price therefor is reduced after the issue date. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (b)(ii) in connection with any transaction to which clause (c) applies. (iii) in case the company shall fix a record date for the issuance on a pro rata basis of rights, options or warrants to the holders of its common stock (or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock) entitling such holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock) at a price per share of common stock (or having a conversion, exercise or exchange price per share of common stock, in the case of a security convertible into, or exerciseable or exchangeable for, shares of common stock) less than the current market price on such record date, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants (or conversion of such convertible securities) shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding as of such record date and the exercise price shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph 11(b)(ii) hereof, as though such maximum number of shares of common stock had been so issued for an aggregate consideration payable by the holders of such rights, options, warrants or other securities prior to their receipt of such shares of common stock. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued or expire in whole or in part unexercised, or in the event of a change in the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options or warrants are entitled (other than pursuant to adjustment provisions therein comparable to those contained in this paragraph 11(b)), the exercise price shall again be adjusted as follows: (a) in the event that all of such rights, options or warrants expire unexercised, the exercise price shall be the exercise price that would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed; (b) in the event that less than all of such rights, options or warrants expire unexercised, the exercise price shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph 11(b)(ii) to reflect the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants that remain outstanding (without taking into effect shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of rights, options or warrants that have lapsed or expired); and (c) in the event of a change in the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options or warrants are entitled, the exercise price shall be adjusted to reflect the exercise price which would then be in effect if such holder had initially been entitled to such changed number of shares of common stock. notwithstanding the foregoing, in case the company shall issue rights, options or warrants ("stockholder rights") to all holders of its common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock, which rights or warrants (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock, (ii) are not exercisable and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common stock, in each case in clauses (i) through (iii) until the occurrence of a specified event or event ("trigger event"), such stockholder rights shall for purposes of this clause (iii) not be deemed issued or distributed until the occurrence of the earliest trigger event and the conversion price shall not be reduced until the occurrence of such earliest trigger event. (iv) in case the company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of any class of common stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the company is the continuing corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, assets or other property, the exercise price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, (a) the numerator of which shall be the exercise price immediately prior to such distributions less the fair market value of the portion of the assets, other property or evidence of indebtedness so to be distributed which is applicable to one share of common stock and (b) the denominator of which shall be the exercise price immediately prior to such distributions. such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. an adjustment to the exercise price also shall be made in respect of dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash to all holders of any class of common stock (excluding any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation (as defined in the certificate of designation for the series a convertible preferred stock of the company) of the company and any cash that is distributed upon a merger, consolidation or other transaction for which an adjustment pursuant to paragraph 11(c) is made) or in the case where the company effects any repurchase of its common stock where the sum of (1) all such cash dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months in respect of which no adjustment has been made and (2) any cash and the fair market value of other consideration paid in respect of any repurchases of common stock by the company or any of its subsidiaries within the preceding 12 months in respect of which no adjustment has been made, exceeds 5% of the company's market capitalization (being the product of the then current market price of the common stock times the aggregate number of shares of common stock then outstanding on the record date for such distribution). the exercise price to be in effect after such adjustment shall be determined by subtracting from the exercise price in effect prior to such adjustment an amount equal to the quotient of (a) the sum of clause (1) and clause (2) above and (b) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date such adjustment is to be determined. (v) the term "dividend," as used in this clause (b), shall mean a dividend or other distribution upon the capital stock of the company. (vi) anything in this clause (b) to the contrary notwithstanding, the company shall not be required to give effect to any adjustment in the exercise price unless and until the net effect of one or more adjustments (each of which shall be carried forward), determined as above provided, shall have resulted in a change of the exercise price such that the number of shares of common stock receivable upon the exercise of each warrant would differ by at least one two-hundredth of one share of common stock, and when the cumulative net effect of more than one adjustment so determined shall be to change the exercise price by at least one two-hundredth of one share of common stock, such change in exercise price shall thereupon be given effect. all calculations under this section 11 shall be made to the nearest four decimal points. (vii) the certificate of any firm of independent public accountants of recognized national standing selected by the board of directors of the company (which may be the firm of independent public accountants regularly employed by the company) shall be presumptively correct for any computation made under this clause (b). (viii) if the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the right of exercise granted by this clause (b) or in the exercise price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record. (ix) if any event occurs as to which the provisions of this section 11(b) are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the rights of the holders of the warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, the board of directors shall make an adjustment in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, so as to protect such rights of the holders of the warrants (c) adjustment in connection with reclassification and reorganization. in the case of any consolidation or merger or reclassification in connection therewith of the company with or into another corporation (a "transaction") occurring at any time, each warrant then outstanding shall thereafter be exercisable for, in lieu of the common stock issuable upon such conversion prior to consummation of such transaction, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable (including cash) upon the consummation of such transaction by a holder of that number of shares of common stock for which such warrant was exercisable immediately prior to such transaction. in case securities or property other than common stock shall be issuable or deliverable upon conversion as aforesaid, then all references in this section 11 shall be deemed to apply, so far as appropriate and nearly as may be, to such other securities or property. the company, or the person formed by the consolidation or resulting from the merger or which acquires such assets or which acquires the company's shares, as the case may be, shall make provisions in its certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent document to establish such rights and such rights shall be clearly provided for in the definitive transaction documents relating to such transaction. the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent document shall provide for adjustments, which, for events subsequent to the effective date of the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent document, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 11. the provisions of this section 11(c) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. (d) no amendments. the company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any consolidation, merger, reorganization, transfer of assets, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this agreement, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the warrant holders thereof against dilution or other impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company (i) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock on the exercise of the warrants from time to time outstanding and (ii) will not take any action which results in any adjustment of the number of warrant shares if the total number of shares of common stock issuable after the action upon the exercise of all of the warrants would exceed the total number of shares of common stock then authorized by the company's certificate of incorporation and available for the purposes of issue upon such exercise. (e) voluntary increases. the company may, but shall not be obligated to, make such increases in the number of warrant shares, in addition to those required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 11, as it considers to be advisable in order that any event treated for united states federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights shall not be taxable to the recipients or if that is not possible, to diminish any income taxes that are otherwise payable because of such event. (f) when issuance or payment may be deferred. in any case in which this section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the exercise price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the holder of any warrant exercised after such record date the warrant shares and other capital stock of the company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the warrant shares and other capital stock of the company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the exercise price and (ii) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share pursuant to section 13 hereof; provided, however, that the company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional warrant shares, other capital stock and cash upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. (g) form of warrants. irrespective of any adjustments in the exercise price or kind of shares or other assets purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants, warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares or other assets as are stated in the warrants initially issuable pursuant to this agreement. (h) other dilutive events. if any corporate action shall occur as to which the provisions of this section 11 are not strictly applicable but as to which the failure to make any adjustment would adversely affect the purchase rights or value represented by the warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such section 11 (which are to place the warrant holder in a position as nearly equal as possible to the position the warrant holder would have occupied had the warrant holder purchased shares of common stock on the date hereof) then, in each such case, the company shall appoint a firm of independent certified public accountants of recognized national standing (which may be the regular auditors of the company) to give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in this section 11, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the purchase rights represented by warrants. upon receipt of such opinion, the company will promptly mail a copy thereof to warrant holders and will make the adjustments described therein. (i) adjustment in warrant shares. except in connection with an adjustment pursuant to 11(c), upon each adjustment in the exercise price of which a warrant is exercisable pursuant to this section 11, the number of warrant shares covered by such warrant shall be adjusted to equal a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of warrant shares before such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, of which the numerator is the exercise price before giving effect to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the exercise price immediately after giving effect to such adjustment. section 12. fractional interests. the company shall not be required to issue fractional warrant shares on the exercise of warrants, although it may do so in its sole discretion. if more than one warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same holder, the number of full warrant shares which shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of warrant shares purchasable on exercise of the warrants so presented. if any fraction of a warrant share would, except for the provisions of this section 13, be issuable upon the exercise of any such warrants (or specified portion thereof), the company shall pay to the warrant holder an amount in cash equal to the market price per warrant share, as determined on the day immediately preceding the date the warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied by such fraction, computed to the nearest whole cent. section 13. notices to warrant holders; rights of warrant holders. upon any adjustment of the number of warrant shares pursuant to section 11 hereof, the company shall promptly thereafter (i) file with the register office a certificate of the senior financial officer of the company (unless the purchasers request a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing selected by the board of directors (who may be the regular auditors of the company)) setting forth the number of warrant shares (or portion thereof) issuable after such adjustment, upon exercise of a warrant and (ii) give to each of the registered holders of the warrant certificates at its address appearing on the warrant register written notice of such adjustments by first-class mail, postage prepaid. where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part of the notice required to be mailed under the other provisions of this section 13. in case the company shall authorize: (a) the issuance of any dividend or other distribution on the common stock, whether in cash, capital stock, or other securities, evidences of indebtedness or other property; or (b) any action which would require an adjustment of the

upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, reclassification, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. the failure to give the notice required by this section 13 or any defect therein shall

reclassification, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or the vote upon any action. nothing contained in this agreement or in any of the warrant certificates shall be construed as conferring upon

provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by a holder of registrable shares or twp, as applicable, expressly for use therein. (b) any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus referred to in section 7(a) hereof, when they become or became effective or are or were filed with the commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the securities act or the exchange act, as applicable, and none of such documents will contain or contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. section 8. indemnification.

(b) indemnification by the holders and any agents and underwriters in connection with any registration. the company may require, as a condition to including any registrable share in any registration statement and to entering into any underwriting agreement with respect thereto, that the company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from each electing holder of such registrable shares and from each underwriter named (if any) in any such underwriting agreement, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless (i) the company and all other holders of registrable shares, (ii) each controlling person of any person referred to in clause (i), and (iii) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of any person referred to in clause (i) or any such controlling person (any person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), referred to for purposes of this section 8(b) and sections 8(c) through 8(e) as an "indemnified person") against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such indemnified person may become subject, under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such indemnified person expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the company for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by the company in connection with investigating or defending any such actions or claims as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the liability of any electing holder pursuant to this subsection (b) shall not exceed the product of the number of registrable shares sold by such electing holder and the initial offering price therefor as set forth in the prospectus therefor. (c) notifications and other indemnification procedures. promptly after receipt by an indemnified person (as defined under each of subsections (a) and (b) of this section 8) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified person shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under such clause, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified person otherwise than under such subsection or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. in case any such action is brought against any indemnified person and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified person (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified person, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified person of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified person under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified person, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. notwithstanding the foregoing, any indemnified person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified person unless the indemnified person shall have been advised by counsel that representation of the indemnified person by counsel provided by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests between the indemnifying party and the indemnified person, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified person that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar actions or proceedings arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all indemnified parties, except to the extent that local counsel, in addition to its regular counsel, is required in order to effectively defend against such action or proceeding. no indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified person, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified person is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified person from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified person. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified person under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on the one hand or the indemnified person on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the indemnified persons were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). the amount paid or payable by an indemnified person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no electing holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the product of number of registrable shares sold by such electing holder and the initial offering price therefor as set forth in the prospectus therefor exceeds the amount of any damages which such electing holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter or sales agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the shares of common stock underwritten or placed by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter or sales agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) the obligations of the company and the electing holders under this section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the company and the respective electing holders may otherwise have. section 9. underwritten offerings. (a) selection of underwriters. if any of the registrable shares covered by the registration are to be sold pursuant to an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be designated by majority holders, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are reasonably acceptable to the company. (b) participation by holders. each holder of registrable shares hereby agrees with each other such holder that no such holder may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder's registrable shares on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. section 10. rule 144 and rule 144a. the company covenants to the holders of registrable shares and the purchasers that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the exchange act, the company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the exchange act or the securities act (including the reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the exchange act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of rule 144 adopted by the commission under the securities act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the commission thereunder, shall make available to each holder of registrable shares and the purchasers the information required by rule 144a(d)(4), and shall take such further action as any holder of registrable shares or the purchasers may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell registrable shares or the purchasers to sell common stock without registration under the securities act within the limitations of the exemptions provided by rule 144 or rule 144a under the securities act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of any holder of registrable shares or the purchasers in connection with that holder's or the purchasers' sale pursuant to rule 144 or rule 144a, the company shall deliver to such holder or the purchasers a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. section 11. holdoff agreement. (a) the company agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of equity securities of the company, including any public sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, or any securities convertibles into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, (a "public sale"), during the period commencing 30 days prior to and ending 90 days after the effective date of any underwritten demand registration or any underwritten piggyback registration (except as part of such underwritten registration or pursuant to registration on form s-8 or any successor form), unless the underwriters managing the offering otherwise agree. (b) each holder of registrable shares agrees not to effect any public sale (and in the case of investors and purchasers, such holders agree not to effect a distribution to their respective partners in connection with an underwritten demand registration in which the purchasers (in the case of investors) or the investors (in the case of purchasers) are participating under this agreement, provided that the party agreeing not to distribute shall have received notice of such registration at least 45 days prior to the effective date thereof) during the period commencing 30 days prior to and ending 90 days after the effective date of any underwritten registration for the account of the company (except as part of such underwritten registration or pursuant to registration on form s-8 or any successor form) or any demand registration, unless, in any such case, the underwriters managing the offering otherwise agree; provided that the holders of investors' shares shall not be subject to the agreement set forth in this subsection 11(b) until the first anniversary of the date hereof; provided further that nothing in this subsection 11(b) shall be deemed to restrict any distribution by the investors or purchasers to their respective partners of such securities otherwise than as expressly set forth above or to restrict the sale of such securities by the partners of the investors or purchasers after any such distribution. (c) the company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any underwriters managing an offering referred to in the existing registration agreement or otherwise to release the holders of registrable shares from any resale restrictions managed by such underwriters with respect to such offerings no later than and on terms no less favorable to the holders of registrable shares than imposed on other holders of shares of common stock who are so released from such resale restrictions. section 12. miscellaneous.
