to group. item 4. purpose of transaction the company and group entered into a share exchange agreement dated as of may 29, 1996, as amended by letter agreement dated may 29, 1996, and as amended and restated by the amended and restated acquisition agreement (in the form attached hereto as exhibit 1) (such share exchange agreement, as so amended and restated, the "acquisition agreement"), pursuant to which (i) on may 29, 1996 (the "first 7 closing date") group acquired a convertible promissory note of the company (in the form attached hereto as exhibit 2) that, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (of which certain material conditions are not within the control of group, ac or anschutz), is convertible at the election of the holder thereof, into 300,000 shares of common stock and (ii) on september 19, 1996 (the "second closing date") the merger was consummated, pursuant to which (a) merger sub was merged into interwest, with interwest being the surviving corporation, (b) interwest became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and (c) group acquired beneficial ownership of 2,306,541 shares of common stock (referred to below as the additional shares). a. summary of transactions. the following brief summary and description of certain provisions of the acquisition agreement and certain related documents referred to therein, including the note and the registration rights agreement, do not purport to be complete summaries or descriptions thereof and are subject to and qualified in their entirety by reference to the acquisition agreement (including the exhibits attached thereto), the note and the registration rights agreement, which are attached hereto as exhibits 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and to the other documents referred to below. capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the acquisition agreement, note or registration rights agreement, as applicable. note. on the first closing date, at par and for cash, the company issued and sold to group a promissory note of the company in the form attached hereto as exhibit 2 (the "note") (a) in the principal amount of $900,000, (b) having a maturity on december 31, 1996, or, if earlier, the date that is 30 days after the earlier to occur of (i) the failure of the shareholders of the company to approve the transaction documents and the transactions at the shareholders meeting (each as defined in the acquisition agreement) and (ii) the termination of the acquisition agreement by group pursuant to the terms thereof, including, without limitation, upon the breach by the company of any representation or warranty in the acquisition agreement, any modification or amendment of the recommendations (as defined in the acquisition agreement) by the company in any respect materially adverse to group, the acquisition by any person other than group of 30% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or the occurrence of a subsequent event (as defined in the acquisition agreement) with respect to the company or a subsidiary, and (c) bearing interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum from the first closing date to and including july 28, 1996 (or, if the second closing date shall then have occurred, august 27, 1996) and the rate of 12.5% per annum thereafter, payable monthly in arrears or, upon the occurrence and during the 8 continuation of a default under the note, at a rate of interest 3.5% per anum greater than the rate otherwise applicable; provided that, if the company shall fail to pay in full the principal amount of the note and all interest accrued thereon at the maturity thereof (whether at scheduled maturity, on the date of any required prepayment or, after the expiration of applicable grace periods and cure periods, upon acceleration), then, at any time during the period commencing the day after the date of such maturity of the note (if the principal amount thereof and all interest accrued thereon shall then not have been paid in full) and ending on a date that is 45 days after the date of such maturity, group may elect to convert the note into 300,000 shares of the company common stock (the "conversion shares") at a price of $3.00 per share (as such number of shares and price per share may be adjusted pursuant to the terms thereof). additional shares. on the second closing date, the company issued in consideration of the merger 2,306,541 shares of common stock of the company (the "additional shares" and, collectively with the conversion shares, the "company shares") such that the number of additional shares issued to group was equal to approximately 48.96% of the 4,711,227 shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately following consummation of the merger. certain affirmative covenants. section 5.1 of the acquisition agreement provides that the company, effective at the second closing, shall have increased the size of its board of directors from five to eight, divided the board of directors into three classes (with one vacancy per class) and caused the vacancy in each class to be filled by a person designated by group (collectively, "group designees"), which group designees shall serve in such capacity, until the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the company. section 5.1 also provides that the company shall take any action required to qualify the company shares for inclusion in the national association of securities dealers automated quotations/small cap market ("nasdaq/small cap"). section 5.2 of the acquisition agreement provides that the company, group and their respective subsidiaries (including interwest) shall undertake certain actions with respect to the maintenance of existence, compliance with laws, use of best efforts to

records, maintenance of properties, conduct of business, maintenance of insurance, payment of taxes, reservation of shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to the transaction documents, and further assurances. 9 registration rights agreement. on the first closing date, as contemplated by section 1.1(a)(2) of the acquisition agreement, the company and group entered into a registration rights agreement (in the form attached hereto as exhibit 3, the "registration rights agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, group will have the right on five occasions, commencing on the second anniversary of the first closing date, to register the company shares (collectively, the "registrable shares") under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act") and, commencing on the first anniversary of the first closing date, to cause the company to include registrable shares in any registration statement filed under the securities act offering any other shares of common stock. b. purpose of the transactions. group's purpose in entering into the acquisition agreement and acquiring the additional shares pursuant thereto is to acquire a significant equity position in the company and to influence the management, policies and activities of the company. group, ac and anschutz believe that the recapitalization of the company as contemplated by the acquisition agreement will enhance the capital structure of the company and will better position the company to take advantage of acquisition and growth opportunities in the communications industry. on the second closing date, craig d. slater, robert l. smith and john m. couzens, each designated by group, were elected as directors of the company for terms expiring at the annual meetings of the shareholders of the company scheduled to be held in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. on and after the second closing date, through the membership of group designees on the board of directors of the company, group, ac and anschutz believe that group will have considerable influence over the management, policies and activities of the company. group may decide to sell any or all of the additional shares, any portion or all of the note or, upon the conversion thereof, any or all of the conversion shares. group, ac and anschutz may acquire or dispose of other shares of common stock or other equity securities of the company. as defined in the acquisition agreement, "equity securities" of a person means the capital stock of the person and all other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, all rights to subscribe for or to purchase, all options for the purchase of, and all calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of its capital stock and any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of the foregoing. the amount, timing and conditions of any such possible purchase or sale of any shares of common stock or 10 other equity securities of the company by group, ac or anschutz will depend upon the continuing assessment by group, ac and anschutz of all relevant factors, including without limitation the following: the company's business and prospects; the attitude and actions of the management, board of directors and other stockholders of the company; other business and investment opportunities available to group, ac and anschutz; the business and prospects of group, ac and anschutz; economic conditions generally and in the communications industry particularly; stock market, commodity market and money market conditions; the availability and nature of opportunities to dispose of the securities of the company owned by group, ac and anschutz; the availability and nature of opportunities for group, ac and anschutz to purchase additional securities of the company; and other plans and requirements of group, ac and anschutz. depending upon their assessment of these factors from time to time, group, ac and anschutz may change their present intentions as stated above. the determination of group, ac and anschutz to have group make an equity investment in the company was made in the context of an overall review of the company, which included the possibility (which group, ac and anschutz intend to continue or consider) of seeking to acquire the company as an entirety, although none of group, ac and anschutz have any present plans in this regard. should one or more of group, ac and anschutz in the future seek to acquire control of the company (including, without limitation, by means of market or privately negotiated purchases of securities of the company, a tender offer, merger or otherwise), the prior establishment of an equity position in the company might assist them in reaching such result. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer group may be deemed to be the direct beneficial owner, and ac and anschutz may be deemed to be indirect beneficial owners, of 2,306,541 shares of common stock referred to in item 4 as the additional shares that have been issued to group on the second closing date in connection with the merger. based upon the number of shares of common stock that were issued and outstanding on the second closing date, such number of shares of common stock is equal to approximately 48.96% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the second closing date after giving effect to the issuance of such shares. group may be deemed to be the direct beneficial owner, and ac and anschutz may be deemed to be indirect beneficial owners, of 300,000 shares of common stock referred to in item 4 as the conversion shares that are issuable upon conversion of the convertible promissory note referred to in 11 item 4 as the note. based upon the number of shares of common stock that were issued and outstanding on the second closing date after giving effect to the issuance of the additional shares, such number of shares of common stock is equal to approximately 5.99% of the number of shares of common stock that would be outstanding as of the second closing date after giving effect to the issuance of such conversion shares. however, each of group, ac and anschutz disclaim such beneficial ownership because the acquisition of such conversion shares is subject to the satisfaction of material conditions not within the control of group, ac or anschutz. based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the second closing date, and assuming the issuance to group of 300,000 conversion shares upon the conversion of the note in addition to the beneficial ownership by group of 2,306,541 additional shares, group, ac and anschutz would own 2,606,541 shares of common stock, or approximately 52.01% of the shares of common stock that would be outstanding as of the second closing date after giving effect to the issuance of all such shares. group, ac and anschutz may be deemed to direct the disposition of the note and, upon the conversion thereof, to share the power both to vote and to direct the disposition of the conversion shares. group, ac and anschutz may also be deemed to share the power both to vote and to direct the disposition of the additional shares of the company referred to above if and when beneficial ownership thereof is acquired by group. reference is made to item 4 for a summary of the transactions pursuant to which group may acquire such beneficial ownership. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of issuer reference is made to item 4 above and the exhibits filed herewith for a description of the acquisition agreement, the note and the registration rights agreement and certain other documents referred to in item 4. 12 item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit 1 amended and restated acquisition agreement dated as

internet communications corporation, a colorado corporation (the "company"), promises to pay to the order of interwest group, inc. or its assigns (the "holder"), on december 31, 1996 (or such earlier

(a) upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, all or any one or more of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to the holder against the company under this note (including, without limitation, the conversion of this note pursuant to section 5) or any of the other transaction documents, or at law or in equity, may be exercised by the holder at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any portion of the obligations hereunder shall be declared due and payable. any such actions taken by the holder shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as the holder may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of the holder permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other transaction documents. (b) the rights, powers and remedies of the holder under this note shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which the holder may have against the company pursuant to the share exchange agreement, this note or the other transaction documents or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. the rights, powers and 5 remedies of the holder may be pursued singly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as the holder may determine in its sole discretion. no delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an event of default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. a waiver of any event of default with respect to the company shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent event of default by the company or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon. (c) the remedies set forth in this section 4 are subject to the provisions of section 8. section 5. conversion. (a) optional conversion following maturity date. this note may be converted into shares of common stock, as follows: (1) if the principal amount hereof and all interest accrued thereon shall not have been paid in full on the maturity date (whether at stated maturity, on the date of any required prepayment, upon acceleration or otherwise), then, during the period commencing on the day following the maturity date and ending at the close of business on the date that is 45 days after the maturity date, and subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this section 5, at the option of the holder, this note or any portion of the principal amount hereof which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, may be converted at the principal amount thereof into shares of common stock, as said shares shall be constituted on the date on which this note shall be surrendered for conversion and notice given in accordance with the provisions of this section (the "conversion date"), at the conversion price (as defined below) in effect at the conversion date. (2) in order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holder shall surrender this note to the company at its executive offices, together with the conversion notice in the form attached hereto as exhibit a (or similar separate written notice) duly executed, and, if so required by the company, accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the company, duly executed by the holder or by its duly authorized attorney in writing. as promptly as practicable after the surrender of this note for conversion as aforesaid, the company shall deliver at its executive office to such holder, or on its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of common stock deliverable upon the conversion of this note or portion thereof (the "conversion shares") and a check or cash in respect of any fraction of a share of common stock otherwise deliverable upon such conversion, all as provided in this section 5, together with a note in principal amount equal to the unconverted and unredeemed portion, if any, of this note so converted. such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date on which such notice shall have been received at said executive offices and this note shall have been surrendered as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose 6 name or names any certificate or certificates for conversion shares shall be deliverable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become on said date the holder or holders of record of the shares represented thereby; provided, however, that any such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the company shall be closed shall constitute the person or persons in whose name or names the certificates are to be delivered as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the conversion price in effect on the date of such surrender. subject to the foregoing, no payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares that shall be delivered upon the conversion of this note. (3) notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (a) if the conversion of any principal amount of this note is to be made in connection with a business combination transaction, the exercise of the conversion privilege may at the election of the holder be conditioned upon the conclusion of such transaction, in which case such exercise shall not be deemed to be effective until the conclusion of such transaction and (b) if the issuance of any conversion shares pursuant to the conversion of any principal amount of this note is not exempt from the applicable requirements under the hart- scott-rodino act, the exercise of the conversion privilege shall be conditioned upon the compliance by the company, the holder and all other persons with such requirements, in which case such exercise shall not be deemed to be effective until all such requirements are satisfied. the holder may by written notice withdraw any such exercise of such conversion privilege before the effectiveness thereof. any such exercise or withdrawal shall not impair or otherwise affect the other rights and remedies of the holder permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other transaction documents. (b) fractional interests. the company shall not be required to deliver fractions of shares of common stock upon conversions of this note. if any fractional interest in a share of common stock would be deliverable upon the conversion of this note, the company shall make an adjustment therefor in cash equal to the average market price per share (determined as provided below) of the common stock on the conversion date. (c) mechanical adjustments. the number of conversion shares issuable upon the conversion of this note and the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time, as follows: (1) if the company shall at any time pay a dividend on its common stock in shares of its common stock (including, if applicable, shares of common stock held by the company in treasury or by a subsidiary), subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a larger number of shares or combine its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares or otherwise effect a reclassification or recapitalization of the common stock, then in each such case the number of conversion shares thereafter issuable upon conversion of this note shall be adjusted so that this note shall thereafter 7 be convertible into the number of conversion shares equal to the number of shares of common stock which the holder would have held after the occurrence of any of the events described above had this note been exercised in full immediately prior to the occurrence of such event. an adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (1) shall become effective retroactively to the related record date in the case of a dividend and shall become effective on the related effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination, reclassification or recapitalization. (2) except with respect to permitted issuances, if the company or a subsidiary shall at any time issue or sell shares of common stock at a purchase price per share of common stock (the value of any consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the board of directors) less than the average market price per share (determined as provided below) of the common stock on the date of issuance or sale (for the purpose of this paragraph (2), the "adjustment date"), then in each such case, the number of conversion shares thereafter issuable upon conversion of this note after such adjustment date shall be determined by multiplying the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note on the date immediately preceding such adjustment date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date of issuance or sale and the number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date of issuance or sale and the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such average market price. for the purposes of this paragraph (2), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company or by a subsidiary. (3) if the company or a subsidiary shall at any time issue or sell derivative securities (as defined below) providing for the purchase of shares of common stock upon the conversion, exchange or exercise thereof at a price per share of common stock (taking into account any consideration received by the company upon the issuance or sale of such derivative securities and any additional consideration to be received upon the conversion, exchange or exercise thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the board of directors) less than the average market price per share (determined as provided below) of the common stock on the date of issuance or sale (for the purpose of this paragraph (3), the "adjustment date"), then in each such case, the number of conversion shares thereafter issuable upon conversion of this note after such adjustment date shall be determined by multiplying the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note on the date immediately preceding such adjustment date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such adjustment date and the number of additional shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such derivative securities, and the denominator of 8 which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such adjustment date and the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such average market price. such adjustment shall be made whenever any such derivative securities are issued, and shall become effective on the date of issuance retroactive to the adjustment date. if all the shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase are not delivered upon the final conversion, exchange or exercise of such derivative securities, then, upon the final conversion, exchange or exercise of such derivative securities, or the expiration, cancellation or other termination thereof, the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note shall thereafter be readjusted to the number of conversion shares which would have been in effect had the numerator and the denominator of the foregoing fraction and the resulting adjustment been made based upon the number of shares of common stock actually delivered upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such derivative securities, or the expiration, cancellation or other termination thereof rather than upon the number of shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase. if the purchase price provided for in any derivative securities, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any derivative securities or the rate at which any derivative securities are convertible into or exchangeable or convertible into common stock shall change at any time (including, without limitation, at the time of or after such conversion, exchange or exercise), the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note in effect at the time of such change shall be readjusted to the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note which would have been in effect at such time had such derivative securities still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, on the related adjustment date, and such readjustment shall become effective on the date of such change retroactive to the adjustment date; provided, that no such readjustment shall have the effect of decreasing the number of conversion shares issuable upon the conversion of this note by an amount in excess of the amount of the adjustment initially made with respect to the issuance or sale of the derivative securities. for the purposes of this paragraph (3), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company or by a subsidiary. (4) if the company shall at any time declare or pay a dividend or other distribution on its common stock other than a stock dividend payable solely in shares of common stock or a cash dividend paid out of current earnings (the value of any such dividend or other distribution, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the board of directors), then in each such case, the number of conversion shares thereafter issuable upon conversion of this note after the declaration date therefor (for the purpose of this paragraph (4), the "adjustment date") shall be determined by multiplying the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note on the date immediately preceding such adjustment date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such adjustment 9 date and the number of additional shares of common stock which the aggregate value of such dividend or distribution would purchase at such average market price and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such adjustment date. for the purposes of this paragraph (4), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company or by a subsidiary. (5) if the company or a subsidiary shall at any time purchase shares of common stock at a price per share of common stock (the value of any consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the board of directors) less the average market price per share (determined as provided below) of the common stock on the date of such purchase (for the purpose of this paragraph (5), the "adjustment date"), then in each such case, the number of conversion shares thereafter issuable upon conversion of this note after such adjustment date shall be determined by multiplying the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note on the date immediately preceding such adjustment date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such adjustment date and the number of additional shares of common stock which the aggregate purchase price of the total number of shares so purchased would purchase at such average market price and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such adjustment date and the number of shares of common stock so purchased. for the purposes of this paragraph (5), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company or by a subsidiary. (6) in case of any capital reorganization or any reclassification (other than a change in par value) of the capital stock of the company, or of any exchange or conversion of the common stock for or into securities of another corporation, or in case of the consolidation or merger of the company with or into any other person (other than a merger which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of common stock) or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the company, the person formed by such consolidation or resulting from such capital reorganization, reclassification or merger or which acquires such assets, as the case may be, shall make provision such that this note shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, cash and other property receivable upon such capital reorganization, reclassification of capital stock, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, as the case may be, by a holder of the shares of common stock equal to the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note immediately prior to the effective date of such capital reorganization, reclassification of capital stock, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, assuming (1) such holder of common stock of the company is not a person with which the company consolidated or into which the company merged or which merged into the company or to which such sale or transfer was made as the case may be ("constituent 10 entity"), or an affiliate of a constituent entity, and (2) such person failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such capital reorganization, reclassification of capital stock, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and, in any case appropriate adjustment (as determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to rights and interests thereafter of the holder, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including the specified changes in and other adjustments of the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note) shall thereafter be applicable, as near as reasonably may be, in relating to any shares of stock or other securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon conversion of this note. (7) for the purposes of this section 5: (a) "average market price" per share of common stock on any date means the average of the daily closing prices for the fifteen (15) consecutive trading days commencing twenty (20) trading days before the date of declaration or authorization by the board of directors of the company of such issuance or distribution; (b) "closing price" means the last reported sales price, regular way, per share of common stock on such day, or if no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in each case, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on a national securities exchange, or, if shares of such stock are not listed or admitted to trading on a national securities exchange, on the nasdaq/national market system or the nasdaq/small cap market, as the case may be, or, if such last sales price or closing bid and asked prices are not so reported, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by any new york stock exchange member firm selected from time to time by the board of directors for such purpose, or if no such prices are available, the fair market value of the common stock as determined in good faith by the board of directors; (c) "derivative securities" means securities convertible into or exchangeable or convertible into shares of common stock, rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock, options for the purchase of, or calls, commitments or other claims of any character relating to, shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of the foregoing; and (d) "permitted issuances" means the issuance of shares of common stock after the date of this note (i) pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options, in each case in accordance with the terms thereof as of the date of this 11 note, (ii) pursuant to the conversion of this note and (iii) with the approval of holder, which approval may be granted, withheld, conditioned or delayed in its sole discretion. (8) if any shares of common stock or derivative securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. in case any shares of common stock or derivative securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of marketable securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the market price thereof as of the date of receipt. in case any shares of common stock or derivative securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger or other business combination in which the company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of common stock or securities, as the case may be. the fair value of any consideration other than cash or marketable securities shall be determined jointly by the company and the holder. if such parties are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time, such fair value shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the holder, whose determination shall be final and binding on the company and the holder. the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be paid by the company. (9) if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution on its common stock or (b) to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or derivative securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the payment or distribution of such dividend or other distribution or the date of issuance and sale of any shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold in connection thereto. (10) all calculations under this section 5 shall be made to the nearest one-thousandth of a share of common stock. (11) the price payable by the holder for the issuance of conversion shares by the company upon conversion of this note (the "conversion price") is $3.00 per conversion share at the date of this note. whenever the number of conversion shares issuable upon the conversion of this note is adjusted or readjusted pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (10), inclusive, above, the conversion price payable upon conversion of this note shall be adjusted or readjusted by multiplying the conversion price immediately prior to the related adjustment date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of conversion shares purchasable upon the conversion of this note immediately preceding such adjustment date, and the denominator of which shall be the number of conversion shares so purchasable immediately thereafter; provided that no such readjustment pursuant 12 to paragraph (3) above with respect to the conversion, exchange or exercise, or expiration, cancellation or other termination, of any derivative securities shall have the effect of increasing the conversion price by an amount in excess of the amount of the adjustment initially made in respect of the issuance or sale of such derivative securities. (12) if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this section 5 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the company's board of directors shall make an appropriate adjustment in the number of conversion shares issuable upon conversion of this note and the conversion price so as to protect the rights of the holder under this note. (13) for the purpose of this section 5, the term "shares of common stock" means (a) the class of stock designated as the common stock of the company at the date of this note or (b) any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassification of such shares consisting solely of changes in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value. in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4), inclusive, above, the holder shall become entitled to receive any shares of the company other than shares of common stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of this note and the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the conversion shares contained in paragraphs (1) through (4), inclusive, above, and the provisions of sections 5(d), 5(e) and 5(f), inclusive, with respect to the conversion shares, shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. (14) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, there shall be no adjustment in the number of conversion shares or in the conversion price in respect of permitted issuances. (15) in case of any consolidation or merger of the company with or into another entity (whether or not the company is the surviving entity) or in case of any sale, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the company, the company or such successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, shall execute with the holder an agreement that the holder shall have the right thereafter upon payment of the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such action to purchase upon conversion of this note the kind and amount of shares and other securities, cash and property that the holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive after the happening of such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, lease or conveyance had this note been exercised in full immediately prior to such action, and if the successor or purchasing entity is not a corporation, such person shall provide appropriate tax indemnification with respect to such shares or other securities and property so that upon conversion of this note, the holder would have the same benefits it otherwise would have had if such successor or purchasing 13 person were a corporation. such agreement shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in paragraphs (1) through (14), inclusive, above. the provisions of this paragraph (15) shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances. (d) time of adjustments. each adjustment required by section 5(c) shall be effective as and when the event requiring such adjustment occurs. (e) notice of adjustment. whenever the number of conversion shares purchasable upon the conversion of this note or the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided, the company shall promptly mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants selected by the board of directors of the company (who may be the regular accountants employed by the company) setting forth the number of conversion shares purchasable upon the conversion of this note and the conversion price after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made. such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment. (f) no adjustment for dividends. except as provided in section 5(c), no adjustment in respect of any dividends declared or paid on the common stock shall be made during the term of this note or upon the conversion of this note.

it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for the indemnified person, which firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified person). the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceedings, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified person from and against any loss or liability by reason of the settlement or judgment. 11 (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 3 is unavailable to an indemnified person (other than by reason of exceptions provided in this section 3) in respect of losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in this section 3, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified person, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified person as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified person on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified person and by these persons' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 3(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. the amount paid or payable by a person as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by the person in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. notwithstanding in the foregoing to the contrary, no registering stockholder or underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which (1) in the case of any registering stockholder, the net proceeds received by the registering stockholder the sale of registerable shares or (2) in the case of an underwriter, the total price at which the registerable shares purchased by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds, in any such case, the amount of any damages that the registering stockholder or underwriter, as the case may be, has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission. no person guilty of fraudulent representation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) each registering stockholder participating in a registration pursuant to section 1 shall cause each underwriter of any of the registrable shares owned by the registering stockholder to be distributed pursuant to the registration to agree in writing on terms reasonably satisfactory to the company to indemnify and to hold harmless the company and its officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls any of them within the meaning of section 15 (or any successors provision) of the securities act, and their respective successors, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities to third parties (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in the registration statement or the prospectus or other document incident thereto or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and to reimburse the company and each other person indemnified pursuant to the agreement for any legal or any other expense reasonably 12 incurred in connection with investigating or defending any claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided that the agreement shall apply only if (and only to the extent that) the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the company in writing by the underwriter specifically for use in the registration statement or the prospectus. section 4. transfer restrictions. (a) the stockholder acknowledges that the company will issue and sell the shares in reliance upon the exemption afforded by section 4(2) of the securities act for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. the stockholder represents that (1) it will acquire the registrable shares for investment and without any view toward distribution of any of the shares to any other person, (2) it will not sell or otherwise dispose of the registrable shares except in compliance with the registration requirements or exemption provisions under the securities act.

(2) "the shares represented by this certificate are subject to the restrictions contained in the registration rights agreement dated as of may 29, 1995, a copy of which is on file at the office of the secretary of the company." (c) the legend stated in section 4(b)(1) shall be removed by delivery of one or more substitute certificates without such legend if either (1) the related certificates are issued in connection with a sale registered under the securities act or (2) the holder thereof shall have delivered to the company a copy of a letter from the staff of the securities and exchange commission or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company, to the effect that the legend is not required for purposes of the securities act. (d) the legend stated in section 4(b)(2) shall be removed by delivery of one or more substitute certificates without such legend at such time as the related securities are no longer subject to this agreement. section 5. filings. the company shall make all filings with the securities and exchange commission required in order to make available to the holders of registrable shares the exemption from the registration requirements provided by rule 144 (or any successor regulation) under the securities act. 13 section 6. merger, consolidation, exchange, etc. in the event, directly or indirectly, (1) the company shall merge with and into, or consolidate with, or consummate a share exchange pursuant to the colorado business corporation act (or successor provisions or statutes) with, any other person, or (2) any person shall merge with and into, or consolidate, the company and the company shall be the surviving corporation of such merger or consolidation and, in connection with such merger or consolidation, all or part of the registrable shares shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person, then, in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such other person shall be bound by the provisions of this agreement and the term "company" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such other person. section 7. other agreements.
