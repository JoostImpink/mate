(e). &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; not applicable. item&#160;6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer &#160; the reporting person entered into a confidentiality agreement, dated as of december 21, 2016 (the &#8220;confidentiality agreement&#8221;), with the issuer pursuant to which each party agreed to certain restrictions with respect to certain nonpublic information regarding the other party. in addition, the confidentiality agreement provides that, for a period of eighteen months from the date of the confidentiality agreement, unless specifically invited in writing by the board of directors of the issuer, neither the reporting person, its affiliates, subsidiaries or certain representatives acting on the reporting person&#8217;s behalf or on behalf of other persons acting in concert with the reporting person at that time will in any manner, directly or indirectly: a) effect or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) (i) any acquisition of any securities (or beneficial ownership thereof), or rights or options to acquire any securities (or beneficial ownership thereof), or substantially all of the assets of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries (provided that the foregoing shall not apply to any acquisition of securities by any employee benefit plans in the ordinary course of business), (ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving the issuer or any of the subsidiaries constituting a significant portion of the consolidated assets of the issuer and its subsidiaries, (iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, or (iv) any &#8220;solicitation&#8221; of &#8220;proxies&#8221; (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the securities and exchange commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of the issuer; b) form, join or in any way participate in a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under the act) with respect to the issuer or otherwise act in concert with any person in respect of any such securities; c) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek representation on or to control or influence the management, board of directors or policies of the issuer or to obtain representation on the board of directors of the issuer; d) take any action which would or would reasonably be expected to require the issuer to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above; or e) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing. the foregoing restrictions do not apply to the transactions contemplated under the merger agreement or to the support agreement or the non-dissent agreements.&#160; the confidentiality agreement also provides that in the event that the issuer enters into a confidentiality agreement (a &#8220;third party agreement&#8221;) with any person in connection with a proposal to acquire more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer or all or substantially all of the subsidiaries or assets of the issuer (such person being referred to herein as a &#8220;third party&#8221;) which contains standstill provisions that are less favorable to the issuer than the standstill provisions contained in the confidentiality agreement (the &#8220;standstill&#8221;), at the reporting person&#8217;s option, the standstill shall be automatically amended to be substantially similar to the standstill provisions contained in such third party agreement.&#160; under the confidentiality agreement, the standstill restrictions will become inoperative and of no force or effect on the reporting person if (i) any other person or &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined in section 13(d)(3) of the act) acquires or proposes to acquire more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer or (ii) the issuer or any of its affiliates enters into an agreement with a person other than the issuer or any of its affiliates, providing for a merger, share exchange, asset or equity sale or other business combination transaction pursuant to which voting securities representing more than 50% of the then outstanding voting securities of the issuer (or, if applicable, the survivor or successor or its publicly traded direct or indirect parent company) would be beneficially owned by persons other than the then current holders of shares of voting securities of the issuer. &#160; except for the confidentiality agreement, non-dissent agreements, merger agreement and the support agreement described above, to the knowledge of the reporting persons, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise), including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder&#8217;s fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, among the persons named in item 2 or between such persons and any other person, with respect to any securities of issuer, including any securities pledged or otherwise subject to a contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power or investment power over such securities other than standard default and similar provisions contained in loan agreements. &#160;
