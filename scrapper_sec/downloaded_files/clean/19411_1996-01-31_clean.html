___________________________________________(__________) fully paid and nonassessable shares of the company's common stock, par value $.25 per share (the "common stock"), at an exercise price per share of $26.150 (the "exercise price"). the term "warrant shares", as used herein, refers to the shares of common stock purchasable hereunder. the warrant shares and the exercise price are subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 4 hereof. this warrant is one of a series of warrants (the "warrants") issued pursuant to, and is subject to all terms, provisions, and conditions contained in,

purchase agreement which restrict the exercise of the warrants, this warrant may be exercised by the holder hereof, in whole or in part, by the surrender of this a-1 32 warrant, together with a completed exercise agreement in the form attached hereto, to the company during normal business hours on any business day at the company's principal office in atlanta, georgia (or such other office or

shares specified in said exercise agreement, which such payment shall be made in cash or by certified or official bank check. the company shall not be required to issue fractional warrant shares upon

name as shall be designated by said holder. if this warrant shall have been exercised only in part, then, unless this warrant has expired, the company shall, at its expense, at the time of delivery of

face with the same legend appearing on the face of this warrant. the company shall pay all taxes and other expenses and charges payable in connection with the preparation, execution, and delivery of stock certificates (and any new warrants) pursuant to this paragraph 1 except that, in case such stock certificates shall be registered in a name or names other than the holder of this warrant, funds sufficient to pay all stock transfer taxes which shall be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of such stock certificates shall be paid by the holder hereof to the company at the time of the delivery of such stock certificates by the company as mentioned above. 2. period of exercise. subject to the provisions of the purchase agreement which restrict the exercise of the warrants, this warrant is exercisable at any time or from time to time during the period commencing on january ____, 1997 and ending 5:00 p.m. atlanta, georgia, local time, on january ___, 2000 (the "exercise period"). 3. certain actions prohibited. the company will not, by amendment of certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed by it hereunder, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this warrant and in the taking of all such action as may reasonably be requested by the holder of this warrant in order to protect the exercise privilege of the holder of this warrant against dilution or other impairment, consistent with the tenor and purpose of this warrant. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the company will not increase the par value of the shares of common stock receivable upon the exercise of this warrant above the exercise price then in effect, (ii) before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the exercise price below the then par value of the shares of common stock so receivable, the company will a-2 33 take all such corporate action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock at such adjusted exercise price upon the exercise of this warrant, or (iii) the company will not take any action which results in any adjustment of the exercise price if the total number of shares of common stock issuable after the action upon the exercise of this warrant would exceed the total number of shares of common stock then authorized by the company's charter and available for other the purpose of issue upon such exercise. 4. anti-dilution provisions. the exercise price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this paragraph 4. upon each adjustment of the exercise price, the holder of this warrant shall thereafter be entitled to purchase, at the exercise price resulting from such adjustment, the largest number of warrant shares obtained by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of warrant shares purchasable hereunder immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by the exercise price resulting from such adjustment. for purposes of this paragraph 4, the term "capital stock", as used herein, includes the common stock and any additional class of stock of the company having no preference as to dividends or distributions on liquidation which may be authorized in the future by an amendment to the company's charter, provided that the shares purchasable pursuant to this warrant shall include only shares of common stock, or shares resulting from any subdivision or combination of the common stock, or in the case of any reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, or sale of the character referred to in this paragraph 4, the stock or other securities or property provided for in this paragraph 4. (a) subdivisions and combinations. in case at any time the company shall (i) subdivide the outstanding shares of capital stock into a greater number of shares, or (ii) combine the outstanding shares of capital stock into a smaller number of shares, the exercise price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted proportionately so that the adjusted exercise price shall bear the same relation to the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such event as the total number of shares of capital stock outstanding immediately prior to such event shall bear to the total number of shares of capital stock outstanding immediately after such event. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of a subdivision or combination. (b) stock dividends. in case the company at any time after the date hereof shall declare, order, pay or make any dividend or other distribution to all holders of the capital stock payable in capital stock, then in each such case, subject to paragraph 4(d) hereof, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or distribution shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the nearest .001 of a cent) determined by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of capital stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of capital stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution. such adjustment shall be made on the date such dividend is paid or such distribution is made and shall become effective retroactive to the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution. a-3 34 (c) dividends other than stock dividends. in case the company at any time after the date hereof shall declare, order, pay or make any dividend or other distribution to all holders of the capital stock, other than a dividend payable in shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, dividends or distributions payable in cash, evidences of indebtedness, rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock or other securities, or any other securities or other property), then, and in each such case, subject to paragraph 4(d) hereof, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive such dividend or distribution shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the nearest .001 of a cent) determined by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the "market price" (as defined below) in effect on such record date or, if any class of capital stock trades on an ex-dividend basis, the trading date immediately prior to the date of commencement of ex-dividend trading, less the value of such dividend or distribution (as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company) applicable to one share of capital stock, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be such market price on such record date or, if any class of capital stock trades on an ex-dividend basis, the trading date immediately prior to the date of commencement of ex-dividend trading. such adjustment shall be made on the date such dividend is paid or such distribution is made and shall become effective retroactive to the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution. for the purpose hereof, "market price" shall mean, on any date specified herein, (a) if any class of capital stock is listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the highest price obtained by taking the arithmetic mean over a period of 20 consecutive days on which such national securities exchange (or if such stock is traded on more than one national securities exchange, the exchange the company has designated under the securities exchange act of 1934 to receive copies of reports filed by the company under such act) is open for trading on a regular basis (any such day is a "trading day") ending the trading day immediately prior to such date of the average, on each such trading day, of the high and low sale prices of shares of each such class of capital stock or if no such sale takes place on such date, the average of the highest closing bid and lowest closing asked prices thereof on such date, in each case as officially reported on all national securities exchanges on which each such class of capital stock is then listed or admitted to trading, or (b) if no shares of any class of capital stock are then listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the highest closing price of any class of capital stock on such date in the over-the-counter market as shown by the nasdaq national market system or, if no such shares of any class of capital stock are then quoted in such system, as published by the national quotation bureau, inc. or any similar successor organization, and in either case as reported by any member firm of the new york stock exchange selected by the company. if no shares of any class of capital stock are then listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange and if no closing bid and asked prices thereof are then so quoted or published in the over-the-counter market, "market price" shall mean the higher of (x) the book value per share of capital stock (assuming for the purposes of this calculation the economic equivalence of all shares of all classes of capital stock) as determined on a fully diluted basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by the board of directors of the company as of the last day of any month ending within 60 days preceding the date as of which the determination is to be made or (y) the fair value per share of capital stock (assuming for the purposes of this calculation the economic equivalence of all shares of all classes of capital stock), as determined on a fully diluted basis in good faith by the board of directors of the company, as of a date which is 15 days preceding the date as of which the determination is to be made. a-4 35 (d) minimum adjustment of exercise price. if the amount of any adjustment of the exercise price required pursuant to this paragraph 4 would be less than one percent (1%) of the exercise price in effect at the time such adjustment is otherwise so required to be made, such amount shall be carried forward and adjustment with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate at least one percent (1%) of such exercise price; provided that, upon the exercise of this warrant, all adjustments carried forward and not theretofore made up to and including the date of such exercise shall, with respect to the portion of this warrant then exercised, be made to the nearest .001 of a cent. (e) fundamental change transaction. in case at any time after the date hereof a purchase, tender, or exchange offer shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of capital stock, or the company is otherwise a party to any transaction (including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all the company's assets, liquidation, or recapitalization of the capital stock) which is to be effected in such a way that as a result of such transaction or offer (x) the holders of common stock (or any other securities of the company then issuable upon the exercise of this warrant) shall be entitled to receive stock or other securities or property (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for common stock (or such other securities), or (y) the capital stock ceases to be a publicly traded security either listed on the american stock exchange, the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq national market system or any successor thereto or comparable system (each such transaction being herein called a "fundamental change transaction"), then, as a condition of such fundamental change transaction, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the holder of this warrant shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in this warrant, and in lieu of the shares of common stock (or such other securities) purchasable immediately before such transaction upon the exercise hereof, such stock or other securities or property (including cash) as may be issuable or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of common stock (or such other securities) equal to the number of shares of common stock (or such other securities) purchasable immediately before such transaction upon the exercise hereof, had such fundamental change transaction not taken place. in any such case appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the holder of this warrant to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, the provisions for adjustments of the exercise price and of the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise hereof) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof (including an immediate adjustment of the exercise price if by reason of or in connection with such fundamental change transaction any securities are issued or event occurs which would, under the terms hereof, require an adjustment of the exercise price). in the event of a consolidation or merger of the company with or into another corporation or entity as a result of which a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation or entity are issuable to holders of capital stock in respect of the number of shares of capital stock outstanding immediately prior to such consolidation or merger, then the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such consolidation or merger shall be adjusted in the same manner as though there were a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of capital stock. the company shall not effect any such fundamental change transaction unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof the successor corporation or entity (if other than the company) resulting from such consolidation or merger or the corporation or entity purchasing such assets and any other corporation or entity the shares of stock or other securities or property of which are receivable thereupon by the holder of this warrant shall expressly assume, by written instrument executed and delivered (and satisfactory in form) to the holder of this warrant, (i) the obligation to deliver to such holder such stock or other securities or property a-5 36 as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to purchase and (ii) all other obligations of the company hereunder. (f) notice of adjustment. upon the occurrence of any event requiring an adjustment of the exercise price, then and in each such case the company shall promptly deliver to the holder of this warrant a notice stating the exercise price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. within 90 days after each fiscal year in which any such adjustment shall have occurred, or within 30 days after any request therefor by the holder of this warrant stating that such holder contemplates exercise of this warrant, the company will deliver to the holder of this warrant a certificate of the company's chief financial officer confirming the statements in the most recent notice delivered under this paragraph 4(f).
