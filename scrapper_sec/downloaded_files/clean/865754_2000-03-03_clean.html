hereinafter referred to as "murmann" -- and danfoss a/s, nordborg, denmark, represented by jorgen mads clausen, - hereinafter referred to as "danfoss" -- murmann and danfoss hereinafter each called "the party" or also collectively referred to as "the parties" -- and danfoss murmann holding a/s, nordborg, denmark, - hereinafter referred to as "holding" -- preamble (a) murmann and related entities/persons control (directly or indirectly) by majority stockholdership sauer inc., a delaware corporation having its headquarters in ames, iowa, usa (hereinafter referred to as "sauer inc." or "the company"). sauer inc. is active in the design, manufacture and sale of highly engineered hydraulic systems and components for use primarily in demanding applications of off-highway mobile equipment (hereinafter referred to as "mobile hydraulics"). danfoss has -- inter alia -- also substantial activities in special fields of the design, manufacture and sale of mobile hydraulics mainly concentrated in the danfoss fluid power a/s, nordborg, denmark and the danfoss fluid power inc., racine, wisconsin, usa as further described in the stock exchange agreement (appendix 1). (b) both, murmann and danfoss, have become convinced that a close cooperation in the field of mobile hydraulics by way of combining the respective activities of sauer inc. and danfoss will strongly improve the competitive strength and would therefore be in the mutual interest of sauer inc. and danfoss. the overall objective of such 1 combination is to favour a growth and rationalisation strategy that will position the combined business as an important player on the markets with low costs, high quality and innovation will be a substantial value driver compared with other solutions available. (c) for this purpose, murmann and danfoss will concentrate the mobile hydraulics business of sauer inc. and danfoss by involving a new corporation to be owned by the parties, the holding. the holding will hold the majority of sauer inc. ordinary common stock in direct successorship of murmann's present majority position. to reach this target murmann will contribute to holding shares of sauer inc. ordinary common stock and danfoss will contribute to holding the danfoss mobile hydraulics business. the contribution from danfoss will be transferred from holding to sauer inc. against shares of sauer inc. ordinary common stock newly to be issued to holding according to the stock exchange agreement. after the closing date as defined in the stock exchange agreement, but before 31 december 2000, danfoss will further contribute its mobile hydraulics business against shares in holding in holland, belgium, spain, portugal, switzerland, japan, singapore (which also covers sales in asean countries), hong kong, new zealand, australia, brazil (which also covers sales in south america) and mexico through holding to sauer inc. the provisions of this agreement, in particular articles 2 and 4, shall apply correspondingly. furthermore, danfoss will after the closing date on conditions described in the stock exchange agreement continue to act as a distributor for sauer inc. in iceland, russia, india and south africa. sauer inc. will further on operate under the name "sauer-danfoss inc." now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and covenants set forth herein, murmann and danfoss enter into this joint venture agreement (hereinafter referred to as "the agreement") and hereby agree as follows: a. formation of the joint venture article 1 foundation of the holding murmann has acquired all shares of a corporation under danish law with the name danfoss murmann holding a/s with a registered capital stock amounting to dk 500.000 and residing at nordborg, denmark. danfoss murmann holding a/s shall have 500,000 class a shares and 26.512.312 class b shares (such class b shares hereinafter referred to as "shares") with the 2 respective rights in connection therewith as stated in holdings articles of association (appendix 4). article 2 contributions of the parties to the holding (a) the parties shall make the following contributions in kind to the holding: - murmann: 10.362.500 shares of sauer inc. ordinary common stock, - danfoss: the danfoss mobile hydraulics business. (b) by way of capital increase of the holding, the parties shall receive shares of the holding in proportion to 10.362.500 (murmann) to the number of sauer inc. ordinary common stock holding has received as compensation for the danfoss mobile hydraulics business amounting to 16.149.812 (danfoss). in the result, the parties receive for 1 (one) sauer inc. share (with a nominal value of us-$ 0,01 each) 1 (one) holding share (with a nominal value of dkk 1 each). the details of the contributions in kind are set forth in the shareholders' resolution concerning the capital increase based on murmann's contribution attached as draft hereto as appendix 2 and in the shareholders' resolution based on the contribution of danfoss attached as draft hereto as appendix 3. (c) danfoss will acquire 50% of the class a shares amounting to dkk 500.000, which murmann has acquired according to article 1 above, the compensation being half of murmann's expenditures on acquiring the holding. (d) the parties agree to contribute additional shares of sauer inc. ordinary common stock to holding at an equal amount in case of capital increase of sauer inc. by issuance of new shares of ordinary common stock in order always to keep the majority position of the holding (more than 50%). as long as murmann has not contributed the number of shares holding has received as compensation for the danfoss mobile hydraulics business, first, before the equal commitment of both parties mentioned above, murmann shall contribute the missing shares to maintain holding's majority position with sauer inc. 3 (e) murmann is entitled to contribute at any time additional shares of sauer inc. ordinary common stock against new shares of holding at a corresponding amount according to the provision of (b) above limited to a 50% shareholdership in the holding, however murmann is obligated on or before december 31, 2003 to contribute and maintain ownership thereafter of additional sauer inc. shares to holding so his total contribution to holding of sauer inc. shares is minimum 25.1% of the total issued sauer inc. shares calculated on a diluted basis. (f) each party is entitled to withdraw at any time after december 31, 2003 shares of sauer inc. ordinary common stock against the return of shares of holding, however each party is obligated to keep at all times a total contribution of minimum 25.1% of the total issued sauer inc. shares calculated on a fully diluted basis. the parties are further in agreement to reduce the share capital of holding, if it is necessary, to provide for such withdrawal by one party. (g) one holding share shall always equal one sauer inc. share common stock. this principle contains generally the formula for determining the number of shares of holding which either party shall receive or contribute to holding if such party either contributes or withdraws sauer inc. shares from holding. (h) murmann guarantees that the 6.812.500 shares owned by k. murmann & co. kg and by murmann (conversion of silent partnership shares) will vote together with holding in any shareholder/board vote of sauer inc. the above mentioned 6.812.500 shares shall not be transferred to a third party (outside the murmann group consisting of the k. murmann & co. kg and its partners and murmann and its subsidiaries) without the prior written consent of danfoss, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. article 3 stock exchange agreement (a) the holding will contribute and transfer the acquired danfoss mobile hydraulics business to sauer inc. against 16,149.812 newly issued shares of sauer inc. ordinary common stock. (b) the contribution and assignment mentioned under subsection a) above is set forth in detail in the stock exchange agreement between sauer inc. and the holding. 4 article 4 warranties of the parties in connection with their contributions (a) danfoss shall grant in favour of murmann and the holding the identical representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities regarding its contribution as the holding has to grant in favour of sauer inc. according to the stock exchange agreement, but shall only indemnify and hold harmless sauer inc. from any such claims pursuant of the stock exchange agreement. if a claim will be raised against holding under the stock exchange agreement, danfoss shall hold harmless holding from any such claims. danfoss shall at its own expense choose and instruct counsel to defend holding in connection with such claims and shall decide the existence, timing and details of any settlement by holding of such claims as set forth in the stock exchange agreement. (b) murmann and holding shall grant in favour of danfoss with regard to the compensation for the contribution of the danfoss mobile hydraulics business the representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities as sauer inc. has to grant in favour of holding according to the stock exchange agreement, except for claims under section 9.04 and 905, which sauer inc will pay to danfoss in full. as regards claims of danfoss the parties agree as follows: any claim of danfoss based on the representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities described in (b) above is limited to the amount equal to the percentage of shares of sauer inc. holding has received as compensation for the danfoss mobile hydraulics business contributed to sauer inc. at closing. in case of such claims of danfoss in accordance with the stock exchange agreement murmann agrees -- for the benefit of sauer inc. and its minority shareholders -- to hold sauer inc. harmless from such claims of holding, and danfoss agrees that murmann can compensate danfoss by paying danfoss 80% of the amount to be paid by murmann as described above. sauer inc. has agreed that murmann is entitled at its own expense to choose and instruct counsel to defend sauer inc. in connection with such claims and shall decide the existence, timing and the details of any settlement by sauer inc. of such claims. murmann shall pay the amount to be paid by murmann as described above by transferring shares of sauer inc. ordinary common stock to danfoss, the valuation of the shares shall be the average price at which such shares have been traded on the new york stock exchange during the last two weeks before murmann's indemnification is 5 payable, or by transferring an equal number or shares in holding. instead of payment by shares, payment can also take place by cash. the parties agree that with the aforementioned 80% payment made by murmann to danfoss, holding is fully compensated for such claims against sauer inc. and against murmann, and that danfoss is fully compensated for such claims with respect to murmann's contribution to the holding and on payment to danfoss, holding and danfoss shall give full release regarding such claims. the following example may clarify the agreement set forth above under this subsection: damage with sauer inc.: us$ 8 million minus basket us$ 5 million relevant damage for indemnification: us$ 3 million participation of holding on total sauer inc. outstanding stock received as compensation for the contribution of the danfoss mobile hydraulics business: 1/3 (one third) of 3 million = us$ 1 million murmann's liability to pay to danfoss: 80% of us$ 1 million = us$ 800.000 (in the above example holding has received as compensation 1/3 of the shares) (c) should a claim arise under a) or b) above, both parties shall cause on one hand sauer inc. and its subsidiaries and on the other hand danfoss fluid power a/s and its subsidiaries and danfoss fluid power inc. to make full disclosure to the other party in connection with such claims consistent with litigation discovery procedure in the usa. (d) murmann or danfoss shall in no event be obligated to indemnify twice the same damage under the stock exchange agreement and this agreement. this agreement shall not expand the parties' liability under the stock exchange agreement. (e) both parties have been taken external tax advise on the tax conditions of the holding and neither party has been granting the other party any warranty for present or future tax conditions of the holding. this shall, however, not affect the parties' rights and obligations regarding tax matters under the stock exchange agreement. 6 b. cooperation of the parties in order to organise the administration and management of the holding article 5 holding company (a) the parties shall agree on the articles of association and the rules of procedure, the draft of which being attached hereto appendix 4 and 5.
