(c) furnish to each holder such number of prospectuses and other documents incident thereto, including any amendment of or supplement to the prospectus, as a selling holder from time to time may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of registrable securities covered by them; (d) notify each seller of such registrable securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act , of the happening of any event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits a fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made (a "changing event"), and, the company will as soon as possible prepare and furnish to such seller (a "correction event") a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; (e) cause all registrable securities included in such registration to be listed on each, if any, securities exchange or system on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed; (f) register or qualify for offer and sale the registrable securities by the time the registration is declared effective by the commission under all applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws of the 50 states of the united states or obtain appropriate exemptions therefrom, to keep each such registration or qualification effective during the period the registration statement is required to be kept effective, and to do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable each holder to consummate the disposition in 6 7 each such jurisdiction of the registrable securities owned by such holder; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to submit to the general service of process in any such jurisdiction unless the company is already subject to such service in such jurisdiction; (g) during the period that the company is required to keep the registration statement effective, the company will advise the holders within a reasonable time (i) when the prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment thereto has been filed, and when the same has become effective, (ii) of any request by the commission for any amendments to, or issuance by the commission of any stop order with respect to the registration statement or any prospectus or amendment thereto, or (iii) of the issuance by any state securities commission or other regulatory authority of any order suspending the registration or qualification or exemption from registration or qualification or any proceedings for that purpose; (h) if reasonably requested by holders' counsel or any holder, incorporate as promptly as practicable in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as such holder or holders' counsel requests to be included therein, including, without limitation, with respect to the registrable securities being sold by such holder to any underwriter or underwriters, the purchase price being paid therefor by such underwriter or underwriters and any other terms of any underwritten offering of the registrable securities to be sold in such offering, and the company shall promptly make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; (i) cooperate with the holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (which shall not bear any restrictive legends unless required under applicable law) representing registrable securities sold under a registration statement to the purchasers thereof, and enable such registrable securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or such holders may request and keep available and make available to the company's transfer agent prior to the effectiveness of such registration statement a supply of such certificates; (j) enter into such customary agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other actions as the holders or the underwriters retained by the holders participating in an underwritten public offering, if any, may reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of registrable securities;

(a) the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder, its partners, officers, directors, trustees, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls any holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, together with the partners, officers, directors, trustees, employees and agents of such controlling person, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions, proceedings or settlements in respect thereof), joint or several, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement (or amendment thereto), prospectus or other document (including any related registration statement, any amendments thereto and all documents incorporated by reference therein) incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or arising out of or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or based on any violation or alleged violation by the company of the securities act, the exchange act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the exchange act or any state securities law, and will reimburse each such person, for any legal and other expenses as are reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) made in such registration statement, prospectus or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder or underwriter and stated to be specifically for use therein or to the extent due to the failure of such holder or underwriter to provide an updated prospectus or other document to a purchaser at a time when the company has informed such holder or underwriter of a material misstatement or omission in a prospectus or other document and has provided updated prospectuses or other documents correcting such misstatement or omission. (b) each holder (on a several and not joint basis) will indemnify the company, its officers, directors, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, together with the officers, directors, employees and agents of such controlling person, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, and each other holder, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions, proceedings or settlements in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement (or amendment thereto), prospectus, or other document (including any related registration statement, any amendments thereto and all documents incorporated by reference therein) incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or arising out of or based on or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such person for any legal and other expenses as are reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus 8 9 or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder and stated to be specifically for use therein; provided, that in no event shall any indemnity under this section 4(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder, and no holder shall be liable under this section 4(b) for any statements or omissions of any other holder; and provided, further, that no holder shall be liable in any such case to the extent due to the failure of the company or underwriter to provide an updated prospectus or other document to a purchaser at a time when such holder has informed the company or underwriter of a material misstatement or omission in a prospectus or other document and has written information correcting such misstatement or omission. (c) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 4 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice in writing to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such indemnified party's expense; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall pay the expense of one counsel for all similarly situated indemnified parties if representation of such indemnified parties by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the indemnified parties and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding, and provided further that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 4, unless such failure materially prejudices the ability of the indemnifying party to defend against the claims asserted against the indemnified party. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation, and no indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment or settle such claim or litigation without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 4 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and such holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the 9 10 company or by such holder and the parties' relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4(d) were based solely upon the number of entities from whom contribution was requested or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this section 4(d). the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above in this section 4(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim, subject to the provisions of section 4(d) hereof. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the obligations of each holder under this section 4(d) are several and not joint, and are subject to the limitation set forth in the proviso to section 4(b) above. 5. information by holders. each holder shall furnish to the company such information regarding such holder and the distribution proposed by such holder as the company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this agreement. 6. "lock-up" agreement. each holder, if requested by the company and the managing underwriter of an offering by the company of common stock, or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock of the company, pursuant to a registration statement, shall agree in writing (the "lock-up agreement") not to sell publicly or otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares of common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock of the company held by such holder (other than those included in the registration, if applicable) for a specified period of time (not to exceed ninety (90) days) following the effective date of such registration statement. notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder shall not be required to enter into a lock-up agreement if a holder has duly elected, in accordance with the instructions provided to him by the company or the underwriter, to include a certain number of his registrable securities in a registration statement contemplated under section 3.2 and, as a result of the limitations set forth in section 3.2(b), is unable to sell more than 50% of such registrable securities under such registration statement. 7. rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may permit the sale of restricted securities to the public without registration, the company agrees to: (a) use its reasonable best efforts to make and keep current public information available as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act at all times; (b) use its reasonable best efforts to file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act; and (c) furnish to the holders forthwith upon request a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of rule 144, and of the securities 10 11 act and the exchange act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents so filed as the holders may reasonably request in availing themselves of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing the holders to sell any such securities without registration. 8. transfer or assignment of registration rights. the rights to cause the company to register securities granted to the holders by the company under section 3 may be transferred or assigned to a person or entity who, on the written advice of counsel, would not be able to sell registrable securities without being subject to the volume and timing restrictions of rule 144 or rule 145; provided that the company is given written notice at the time of or within a reasonable time after said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of said transferee or assignee and identifying the registrable securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and provided further that the transferee or assignee of such rights assumes the obligations of the holders under this agreement. 9. termination. the provisions of this agreement shall terminate on the fourth anniversary of the date of this agreement. 10. amendment; waiver. no amendment, alteration or modification of this agreement shall be valid unless in each instance such amendment, alteration or modification is expressed in a written instrument executed by holders who own at least a majority of the issued and outstanding registrable securities. no waiver of any provision of this agreement shall be valid unless it is expressed in a written instrument duly executed by the party or parties making such waiver; it being agreed and understood that execution by holders who own a majority of the registrable securities shall constitute a waiver by all the holders. the failure of any party to insist, in any one or more instances, on performance of any of the terms and conditions of this agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any rights granted hereunder or of the future performance of any such term, covenant or condition but the obligation of any party with respect thereto shall continue in full force and effect. 11. specific performance, remedies. the parties hereby declare that it is impossible to measure in money the damages which will accrue to a party hereto by reason of a failure to perform any of the obligations under this agreement. therefore, all parties hereto shall have the right to specific performance of the obligations of the other parties under this agreement, and if any party hereto shall institute an action or proceeding to enforce the provisions hereof, any person (including the company) against whom such action or proceeding is brought hereby waives the claim or defense therein that such party has an adequate remedy at law, and such person shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such remedy at law exists. 12. notices. all notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed by first-class, certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or transmitted by facsimile or delivered either by hand, by messenger or by nationally recognized overnight courier, addressed: (a) if to the holders, at the addresses set forth on schedule i attached hereto or at such other address as they shall have furnished to the company in writing. 11 12 with a copy to: kelley drye & warren llp two stamford plaza 281 tresser boulevard stamford, ct 06901-3229 attn: paul f. mccurdy, esq. and clifford chance rogers & wells llp 200 park avenue new york, new york 10166 attn: bonnie a. barsamian, esq. fax: (212) 878-8375 (b) if to the company, at the following address, or at such other address as the company shall have furnished to the holders, labranche & co inc. one exchange plaza new york, new york 10006 fax: (212) 344-1469 attn: michael labranche with a copy to: fulbright & jaworski l.l.p. 666 fifth avenue new york, new york 10103 fax: (212) 752-5958 attention: jeffrey m. marks, esq. alternatively, to such other address as a party hereto supplies to each other party in writing. 13. successors and assigns. all the terms and provisions of this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective permitted transferees, successors and assigns of the parties hereto, whether so expressed or not. 14. governing law. this agreement is to be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the state of new york without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof. 15. titles and subtitles. the titles of the sections of this agreement are for the convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construing this agreement. 12 13 16. severability. the invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this agreement shall not be deemed to affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this agreement. 17. entire agreement. this agreement and the merger agreement constitute the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous agreements, arrangements and understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 18. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. 19. future agreements. the company shall not hereafter enter into any registration rights or other agreement or instrument which violates or materially impairs the rights granted to the holders in this agreement. 20. rpm stockholder agreement. a stockholder shall not have any rights or benefits under this agreement unless such stockholder has executed and delivered to the company an rpm stockholder agreement.

"affiliate" of robb peck mccooey financial services, inc., a delaware corporation ("target"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "rules and regulations") of the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"). pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of january 18, 2001, as amended as of february 15, 2001 (as so amended, the "merger agreement"), by and between labranche & co inc., a delaware corporation ("purchaser"), and target, all of the issued and outstanding shares of target's common stock shall be exchanged for newly issued shares of purchaser common stock and purchaser series a preferred stock (the "merger"). capitalized terms used in this letter and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the merger agreement. as a result of the merger, the undersigned will receive shares of purchaser common stock and purchaser series a preferred stock (collectively, the "purchaser shares") in exchange for the target shares owned by the undersigned. the undersigned represents, warrants, and covenants to purchaser that: a. the undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of purchaser shares in violation of the act or the rules and regulations. 2 b. the undersigned has carefully read this letter and the merger agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations upon the undersigned's ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of purchaser shares to the extent the undersigned felt necessary with counsel for the undersigned or counsel for target. c. the undersigned has been advised that the issuance of the purchaser shares to the undersigned pursuant to the merger agreement has been registered with the commission under the act. however, the undersigned has also been advised that, since at the time the merger agreement was submitted for a vote of the stockholders of target, (a) the undersigned may be deemed to have been an affiliate of target and (b) the distribution by the undersigned of the

sale, transfer, or other disposition has been registered under the act, (ii) such sale, transfer, or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of rule 145 promulgated by the commission under the act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to purchaser, or a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the commission, such sale, transfer, or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the act. d. the undersigned understands that, except as provided for in the registration rights agreement, purchaser is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer, or other disposition of the purchaser shares by the undersigned or on the undersigned's behalf under the act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. e. the undersigned also understands that unless the transfer by the undersigned of the undersigned's purchaser shares has been registered under the act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of rule 145, purchaser reserves the right to instruct its transfer agent to put the following legend on the certificates issued to the undersigned's transferee: "the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which rule 145 promulgated under the securities act of 1933 applies. the shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred unless 2 3 registered thereunder or unless an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 is available." f. execution of this letter should not be considered an admission by the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of target as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter. g. in the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of purchaser shares pursuant to rule 145, the undersigned will supply purchaser with evidence of compliance with such rule, in the form of a broker's letter in customary form or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to purchaser, which evidence may be delivered a reasonable time after such sale or other disposition is executed. the undersigned understands that purchaser may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any purchaser shares disposed of by the undersigned, but that, upon receipt of such evidence of compliance, the transfer agent shall effectuate the transfer of the purchaser shares sold as indicated in such evidence. the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (g) shall cease to be applicable to the undersigned if (i) one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the purchaser shares received in the merger and the provisions of rule 145(d)(2) are then available to the undersigned or (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the purchaser shares received in the merger and the provisions of rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to the undersigned. very truly yours, /s/ george e. robb, jr. -------------------------- george e. robb, jr. 3 4 agreed and accepted
