(a) warrant shares. as used in this agreement, the term "warrant shares" means that number, rounded up to the nearest whole integer, which is equal to the product of (x) the seller common ratio applicable to the cmp warrant, treating cmp as a holder of seller common shares, multiplied by (y) seven million seven hundred thousand (7,700,000) minus the aggregate number of the preferred exchange shares. (b) escrow warrant. buyer shall deliver at the closing to the escrow agent a warrant (the "escrow warrant") entitling cmp or any successor holder thereof to purchase buyer shares. the escrow warrant shall be identical in all material respects to the cmp warrant, except that (i) the number of buyer shares purchasable immediately after the closing upon the full exercise of the escrow warrant shall be that number, rounded to the nearest whole share, which is equal to the product of (x) the total number of warrant shares multiplied by (y) the escrow ratio, and (ii) the exercise price per buyer share of the escrow warrant shall be that price, rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent ($.001), which is equal to the quotient of (x) $1,500 divided by (y) the total number of warrant shares.

(d) if the cmp warrant is exercised in part prior to the closing, there will be an appropriate adjustment to the number of warrant shares and the exercise price of the buyer warrants. if the cmp warrant is exercised in full prior to the closing, none of the buyer warrants will be issued in the merger. 2.6 anti-dilution. in the event that, subsequent to the date of this agreement but prior to the effective time, the outstanding shares of buyer common stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or securities through a split, reverse stock split, or other like changes in buyer's capitalization, other than pursuant to this agreement, as the case may be (a "recapitalization"), then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the number of buyer shares so that each seller stockholder shall receive under section 2.4, or upon exercise of the buyer warrants, the number of buyer shares (except for fractional shares) that such stockholder would have held immediately after the recapitalization if the merger had occurred immediately prior to the recapitalization or the record date therefor, as applicable. for purposes of this section 2.6 and by way of illustration and not limitation, a "recapitalization" will in no event include the (i) issuance of shares or securities by buyer pursuant to any existing or hereafter established or granted stock option or equity award or other compensation plan or arrangement to, or for the benefit of, one or more employees, officers, directors or contractors of buyer or

amount (the "agreed amount") may be released from the escrow fund to buyer or (iii) contest that any of the escrow fund may be released to buyer. cvc may contest the release of escrow fund assets

indemnification under section 8.1(b) or (d) of the merger agreement. if no response notice is delivered to the escrow agent by cvc within the 30-day period from the escrow agent's receipt of such claim notice, cvc shall be deemed to have agreed, on behalf of itself and all escrow account beneficiaries, including the management stockholders, that all of the claimed amount may be released to

be settled by three arbitrators in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules then in effect of the american arbitration association (the "aaa rules"). cvc and buyer shall each designate one arbitrator within 15 days of the delivery of the arbitration notice. cvc and buyer shall cause such designated arbitrators mutually to agree upon and shall designate a third arbitrator; provided, however, that (i) failing such agreement within 45 days of delivery of -7- 8 the arbitration notice, the third arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the aaa rules and (ii) if either cvc or buyer fails to timely designate an arbitrator, the dispute shall be resolved by the one arbitrator timely designated. cvc and buyer shall pay the fees and expenses of their respectively designated arbitrators and shall bear equally the fees and expenses of the third arbitrator. cvc and buyer shall cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be arbitrated pursuant hereto within 60 days after

terms of the merger agreement and this agreement. the final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be furnished to cvc, the management representative, buyer and the escrow agent in writing and shall constitute a conclusive, final and nonappealable determination of the issue in question, binding upon cvc, the management representative, buyer, the escrow agent and all escrow account beneficiaries. such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators' award. after delivery of a response notice that the claimed amount is contested by cvc, the escrow agent shall continue to hold in the escrow fund an amount of escrow fund assets sufficient to cover the contested amount (or such lesser amount as is then available in the escrow fund), notwithstanding the occurrence of the termination date, until (i) delivery of a copy of a settlement agreement executed by buyer and cvc setting forth instructions to the escrow agent as to the release of escrow fund, if any, that shall be made with respect to the contested amount or (ii) delivery of a copy of the final award of the majority of the arbitrators setting forth instructions to the escrow agent as to the amount of the escrow fund, if any, that shall be released with respect to the contested amount. the escrow agent shall promptly thereafter release such

assets having a value equal to all of the claimed amount may be released from the escrow fund to buyer or (ii) the escrow agent is instructed pursuant to section 6.3 to release escrow fund assets to buyer, the escrow agent shall promptly thereafter transfer, deliver and assign to buyer such an amount of assets from the escrow fund equal to (x) in the case of clause (i) of this sentence, the amount of the escrow fund assets that cvc has agreed (or is deemed to have agreed) to allow the escrow agent to release (or such lesser amount of assets as then comprises the entire escrow fund) or (y) in the case of clause (ii) of this sentence, the amount of the escrow fund assets that the escrow agent has been directed to release (or such lesser amount of assets as then comprises the entire escrow fund), in each case pro rata from each escrow account in accordance with the designated percentages. for purpose of calculating the amount of escrow fund assets to be released, escrow

securities must be released in order to give effect to the provisions hereof), secondary escrow securities, cash or cash equivalents or other property constituting assets of each escrow account or any combination -8- 9 thereof per the written instructions of each escrow account beneficiary). if the escrow agent does not receive such instruction from an escrow account beneficiary at least two (2) business days prior to an anticipated release date, buyer shall so instruct the escrow agent. under no circumstances shall the terms of this escrow agreement require the escrow agent to release or distribute all or any portion of the escrow fund sooner than two (2) business days after the escrow agent has received the requisite notices or paperwork in good form, or passage of the applicable claims period or release date, as the case may be. 6.5 limitations on escrow account beneficiary liability. notwithstanding anything contained in this agreement to the contrary, if the escrow value of the escrow fund assets in an escrow account is insufficient to satisfy the indemnification obligations to the buyer with respect thereto, none of cvc, the management representative, the escrow account beneficiary of that escrow account or any other escrow account beneficiary shall be liable hereunder for such deficiency. 7. release of escrow fund upon termination date. promptly after the termination date, the escrow agent shall distribute to the escrow account beneficiaries, all of the assets constituting each such escrow account beneficiary's escrow account after the payment of such escrow account beneficiary's share of the fees and expenses of the escrow agent. notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if buyer has previously given a claim notice which has not then been resolved in accordance with section 6, the escrow agent shall retain in the escrow fund after the termination date an amount of assets from the escrow fund equal to the claimed amount which has not then been resolved, which amount shall be retained pro rata from each escrow account in accordance with the designated percentages. for purpose of calculating the amount of escrow fund assets to be distributed pursuant to this section 7, escrow securities shall be valued at the escrow value. if less than all of the escrow fund assets in an escrow account will be released to an escrow account beneficiary pursuant to this section 7, such assets shall be released in the following order: (i) first, secondary escrow securities, cash or cash equivalents, or other property (other than primary escrow securities) in such amounts as the escrow account beneficiary may direct in writing and (ii) second (to the extent that additional assets from an escrow account must be released in order to give effect to the provisions hereof), primary escrow securities in such amounts as the escrow account beneficiary may direct in writing. if the escrow agent does not receive such instruction from an escrow account beneficiary, buyer shall so instruct the escrow agent. 8. fees and expenses. the fees and expenses of the escrow agent (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) for the preparation of this agreement and the services to be rendered by the escrow agent hereunder in accordance with the attached fee schedule (which may be subject to change hereafter on an annual basis)
