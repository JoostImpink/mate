insurance company, a corporation organized under the laws of switzerland ("zurich"). the address of the principal business and principal office of zurich is 2 mythenquai, ch-8002 zurich, switzerland. zurich and its subsidiaries and affiliates are engaged in life and property and casualty insurance and reinsurance and insurance related businesses and the asset management business. information regarding the identity and background of the directors and executive officers of zurich is set forth in schedule i hereto, which is incorporated by reference in response to this item 2. neither zurich, nor to the best of its knowledge, any of the directors or executive officers set forth in schedule i hereto, have been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) during the last five years. neither zurich, nor to its knowledge, any of the directors or executive officers set forth in schedule i hereto, have been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which zurich was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws during the last five years. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. the family stockholder agreement described in item 4 of this statement (including the voting agreements contained therein) was entered into by the maclellan stockholders (as defined below) as an inducement to zurich to enter into the purchase agreement and the relationship agreement, as described in item 4. except as set forth in the previous sentence, zurich has paid no consideration in connection with the voting agreements contained in the family stockholder agreement. item 4. purpose of transaction. pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement, dated as of may 31, 1996 (the "purchase agreement"), between provident and zurich and subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the receipt of all necessary regulatory and requisite stockholder approvals and the consummation of the merger (as defined below), provident will issue to zurich or one or more of zurich's affiliates, and zurich or one or more of zurich's affiliates will purchase from provident, 9,523,810 newly authorized but unissued shares of common stock, at a price of $31.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $300 million, payable in cash (the "zurich common stock investment"). the purchase agreement is attached to this statement as exhibit 1 and the description of the purchase agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit, which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. the net proceeds from the zurich common stock investment will be used by provident to finance a portion of the cash payments to be made to the paul revere corporation ("paul revere") stockholders pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of april 29, 1996 (the "merger agreement"), by and among provident, patriot acquisition corporation, a massachusetts corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of provident ("newco"), and paul revere. subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory and requisite stockholder approvals, the merger agreement provides for the merger (the "merger") of newco with and into paul revere, with paul revere surviving the merger. the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the purchase agreement (and the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement) must be approved by a majority of votes cast at a special meeting of stockholders of provident anticipated to be held in july 1996 (the "provident special meeting") on each such proposal, respectively, provided that the total votes cast on each such proposal represents over 50% in interest of all shares of common stock entitled to vote at the provident special meeting. approval of the proposed amendment to provident's charter to increase from 65 million to 75 million the number of shares of common stock that provident is authorized to issue (the "charter amendment"), which is required to consummate the zurich common stock investment and the merger, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the provident special meeting. pursuant to the family stockholder agreement, dated as of may 31, 1996 (the "family stockholder agreement"), among zurich, the maclellan foundation, inc., a tennessee nonprofit corporation, and certain members of the maclellan family and certain family trusts, which own of record and beneficially 17,940,903 shares of common stock, or approximately 39.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock (collectively, the "maclellan stockholders"), the maclellan stockholders have agreed to vote, subject to certain exceptions and conditions, all common stock that is beneficially owned by such stockholders in favor of (i) the merger, the merger agreement and the charter amendment and (ii) the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement including the issuance and sale of the shares of common stock to zurich. the family stockholder agreement is attached to this statement as exhibit 3 and the description of the family stockholder agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit, which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. in connection with the purchase agreement, provident and zurich have entered into a relationship agreement, dated as of may 31, 1996 (the "relationship agreement"). the relationship agreement is attached to this statement as exhibit 2, and the description of the relationship agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit, which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. the relationship agreement sets forth (i) certain rights of zurich to designate persons to serve as members of the board of directors of provident, (ii) certain standstill arrangements regarding the acquisition by zurich of additional shares of common stock and (iii) certain restrictions on the ability of zurich to dispose of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by it. pursuant to the relationship agreement, while zurich remains the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the outstanding common stock, zurich shall be entitled to designate two persons to serve as members of the board of directors of provident and any of its subsidiaries. while zurich owns between 5% and 10% of the outstanding common stock, zurich shall have the right to designate one person to serve as a director of provident or any of its subsidiaries. as long as zurich ownership of common stock remains above 5% of the shares outstanding, zurich is entitled to have a zurich designee serve on any executive committee of the board of directors of provident or any of its subsidiaries or any other committee or group performing a similar function. in the event zurich and its affiliates are the beneficial owners of less than 5% of the outstanding common stock, zurich will not be entitled to designate any person to serve as a director of provident. so long as zurich is entitled to designate at least one member of the board of directors of provident, during any period that the requisite number of zurich designees are not members of the board of directors, provident shall cause one person (to be designated by zurich in its sole discretion) to be permitted to attend all meetings of the board of directors of provident and all meetings of the executive committee of provident. provident has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause the election of the number of directors contemplated by the relationship agreement, including (i) placing zurich designees on the slate of directors recommended to stockholders at each annual meeting at which zurich is entitled to designate a person to serve unless (x) a zurich designee requests not to be included or (y) service by a zurich designee would violate applicable law or regulation (in which case zurich may designate an alternate to serve), and (ii) in the event a zurich designee is unable to serve, or is removed or withdraws after service has commenced, zurich may designate a person to serve as such director's replacement. zurich has also agreed to use all reasonable efforts to cause any zurich designee(s) to resign from office in the event that its ownership of provident securities falls below the mandatory thresholds set forth above. in the event the provident board of directors is classified at some point, zurich may appoint its designees to different classes. the relationship agreement sets forth certain conditions and limitations in connection with zurich's ownership of common stock which are to be effective for a period of seven years from the closing of the proposed transactions. zurich and its affiliates have agreed not to acquire shares of common stock in amounts that would cause zurich's ownership of common stock to exceed the percentage of the outstanding common stock represented by the shares of common stock owned by zurich immediately following consummation of the merger and the zurich common stock investment (the "threshold percentage"); provided, that zurich and its affiliates are not prohibited from acquiring shares of common stock that would cause zurich and its affiliates to exceed the threshold percentage if (i) such shares are acquired from (x) the maclellan stockholders, (y) persons other than the maclellan stockholders (under certain circumstances) or (z) textron, inc. ("textron") (with certain restrictions and limitations, including zurich's agreement that prior to purchasing any provident voting securities from textron, zurich will first offer to the maclellan stockholders the right to sell to zurich the same number of voting securities on the same terms as those offered to textron) and (ii) after giving effect to such acquisition of common stock, zurich and its affiliates would not beneficially own more than 40% of the outstanding common stock. however, zurich may acquire shares of common stock from the maclellan stockholders in amounts that would result in zurich beneficially owning more than 40% of the outstanding common stock if zurich first offers to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock at the same price pursuant to either a tender offer to all stockholders or a binding merger agreement. in addition, pursuant to the family stockholder agreement, the maclellan stockholders have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions and conditions, in the event any of them desires to sell shares of common stock, such maclellan stockholder shall first offer to zurich the opportunity to purchase such shares. the relationship agreement also provides that zurich and its affiliates may not dispose of its beneficial interest in any provident voting securities, except: (a) to provident or to any person approved by a majority of the board of directors of provident; (b) in conversion, exchange or otherwise pursuant to the terms of such provident voting securities; (c) in a merger or consolidation in which provident is acquired, in a plan of liquidation of provident, or pursuant to a tender offer under the terms of the relationship agreement; (d) pursuant to a bona fide underwritten public offering; (e) pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"); (f) to an affiliate of zurich, subject to transfer and buyback restrictions; (g) to insurance partners, l.p. or insurance partners offshore (bermuda), l.p. or one or more affiliates of either of them, provided that all voting rights with respect to such provident voting securities are retained by zurich or an affiliate of zurich; and (h) in any other manner, provided that prior to making any offer to sell, sale or other transfer to any person pursuant to this clause (h) of provident voting securities representing beneficial ownership of more than two percent (2%) of the then outstanding provident voting securities, zurich shall give provident the opportunity to purchase, or to designate an alternative purchaser of, such provident voting securities in the manner set forth in the relationship agreement. except as set forth herein, neither zurich nor, to the best of its knowledge, any person set forth in schedule i hereto, has any plans or proposals with respect to any material change in the business or corporate structure of provident or, generally, any other action referred to in instructions (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) zurich may be deemed the beneficial owner of 17,940,903 shares of common stock representing the total number of shares held by the maclellan stockholders, which constitute approximately 39.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock (the "voting shares"). in accordance with rule 13d-3 of the general rules and regulations of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, zurich may be deemed to beneficially own the voting shares because, as more fully described in item 4, under the family stockholder agreement, the maclellan stockholders have agreed to vote the voting shares in accordance with the terms of the family stockholder agreement. the percentage used in this paragraph 5(a) is calculated based upon 45,465,135 shares of common stock outstanding as reported in the company's form 10-q for the quarterly period ended march 31, 1996, as filed with the securities and exchange commission on may 13, 1996. (b) by virtue of the family stockholder agreement, zurich may be deemed to beneficially own the voting shares with shared power to vote and direct the vote of such voting shares on certain issues. zurich does not have the power to dispose or direct the disposition of any shares of common stock. zurich expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the voting shares. (c) except as set forth in this item 5, neither zurich nor, to the best of its knowledge, any executive officer or director listed in schedule i hereto, beneficially owns any shares of common stock or has effected any transactions in the common stock during the preceding 60 days. (c), (d) and (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. in connection with the purchase agreement, provident has agreed to register the shares to be purchased by zurich pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed under the securities act pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement, dated as of may 31, 1996 (the "registration rights agreement"), by and between provident and zurich. provident has also granted to zurich certain limited demand registration rights and unlimited "piggy back" registration rights with respect to shares of common stock beneficially owned by zurich. the registration rights agreement is attached to this statement as exhibit 4 and the description of the registration rights agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit, which is incorporated by reference thereto. other than as set forth in this statement, neither zurich nor, to the best of its knowledge, any of the directors or executive officers set forth in schedule i hereto, has any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with each other or with any other person with respect to any securities of the company, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit 1. common stock purchase agreement, dated as of may 31, 1996, between provident companies, inc. and zurich insurance company. exhibit 2. relationship agreement, dated as of may 31, 1996, between provident companies, inc. and zurich insurance company. exhibit 3. family stockholder agreement, dated as of may 31, 1996, among zurich insurance company, the maclellan foundation, inc. and the stockholders listed in schedule a thereto. exhibit 4. registration rights agreement, dated as of may 31, 1996, between zurich insurance company and provident companies, inc. signatures after reasonable inquiry and to the best knowledge and belief of the undersigned, the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct. date: june 10, 1996 zurich insurance company by: /s/ david a. bowers name: david a. bowers title: executive vice president schedule i directors of zurich insurance company name and business address principal occupation - - ------------------------- -------------------- henry c.m. bodmer deputy chairman, zurich insurance company;

executive vice president zurich insurance company by:/s/ steven m. gluckstern name: steven m. gluckstern title: representative 1 exhibit 1 terms of merger agreement the strategic relationship described herein will be set forth in a "marketing agreement" entered into by the parties. the concepts listed below require further discussions to develop them fully, but it is contemplated that the marketing agreement would include the following: 1. provident intends to continue to offer a wide range of individual and employee benefit products to its customers, through multiple distributions channels. provident would agree to utilize products developed by zurich whenever possible to meet its customers' needs. in the individual marketplace, these products opportunities may include term life, whole life, universal life, variable universal life, individual property and casualty insurance products, and fixed and variable annuities. when a "zurich product" is sold, provident would expect to receive consideration "normal and customary" for the business and would expect to have reasonable opportunity to participate as a reinsurer on this business. 2. provident intends to expand its offerings of retirement/asset accumulation products to its individual and employee benefits customers. it would be provident's intent, depending on the products' design and features, to offer to its customers mutual funds and institutional asset management services offered by zurich. as provident considers integrating life and investment product features into its disability products, provident would intend to utilize zurich's products, as appropriate, in these new product offerings. provident would again expect "normal and customary" consideration when placing business in this capacity. 3. zurich would agree to market provident's individual disability product through its u.s. marketing channels whenever possible, including kemper. the terms of such an agreement would be similar to those used in other "corporate agreements", where zurich would receive consideration for acting as an intermediary. provident would also intend to offer zurich the opportunity to reinsure a portion of this business if appropriate. 4. zurich and provident would jointly explore opportunities to market individual and group disability products outside the u.s. in general it would be expected that provident would 2 contribute its product and risk management expertise, while zurich would contribute its local market knowledge and marketing capabilities. 5. zurich and provident would jointly explore opportunities which may exist in linking group long-term disability coverage with workers compensation coverage. both companies recognize the potential market for a "24 hour" coverage and would commit the resources necessary to investigate whether a mutually acceptable opportunity may exist. 6. zurich and provident would continue to seek other opportunities to leverage each other's strengths, and to bring better value and service to both organizations' customers. this may include reinsurance transactions and potential investment management ventures. 7. if provident elects to engage in a significant reinsurance transaction with respect to its individual disability block of business, provident will give zurich the right to provide such reinsurance on market terms. provident agrees to offer to zurich the opportunity to propose other reinsurance transactions and investment management arrangements and to consider such proposals in good faith. the strategic initiatives outlined above would not be finalized prior to the closing of the other "investor transactions" described in the letter agreement to which this exhibit is attached. provident and zurich would however

and (b) as soon as practicable, use its reasonable best efforts to effect such registration (including, without limitation, the execution of an undertaking to file post-effective amendments, appropriate qualification under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with applicable regulations issued under the securities act) as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such registrable securities as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the registrable securities of any holder or holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request received by the company within 10 business days after written notice from the company is given under section 2(a)(i)(a) above;

provided, however, that the periods during which the company shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this section 2(a) together with any periods of suspension under section 2(i) hereof may not exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any period of 12 consecutive months; (w) if the registrable securities requested by all holders to be registered pursuant to such request are included in, and eligible for sale under, the shelf registration (as defined below); (x) in any particular jurisdiction in which the company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance, unless the company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the securities act or applicable rules or regulations thereunder; (y) after the company has effected three (3) such registrations pursuant to this section 2(a) (in the aggregate for all holders) 5 and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective and the sales of such registrable securities shall have closed; provided, that holders shall not have the right to request an underwritten registration pursuant to this section 2(a) more than one (1) time in any six-month period; or (z) if the registrable securities requested by all holders to be registered pursuant to such request do not have an anticipated aggregate public offering price (before any underwriting discounts and commissions) of not less than $10,000,000. the registration statement filed pursuant to the request of the initiating holders may, subject to the provisions of section 2(a)(ii) below, include other securities of the company which are held by persons who, by virtue of agreements with the company, are entitled to include their securities in any such registration ("other stockholders"). (ii) underwriting. if the initiating holders intend to distribute the registrable securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the company as a part of their request made pursuant to section 2(a). if other stockholders request inclusion in any such registration, the holders shall offer to include the securities of such other stockholders in the underwriting and may condition such offer on their acceptance of the further applicable provisions of this section 2. the holders whose shares are to be included in such registration and the company shall (together with all other stockholders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting) enter into underwriting and related agreements in customary form with the representative of the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the initiating holders and reasonably acceptable to the company. such underwriting agreement will contain such representations and warranties by the company and such other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation, indemnities and contribution to the effect and to the extent provided in section 2(f) hereof and the provision of opinions of counsel and accountants' letters to the effect and to the extent provided in section 2(e) hereof, and the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of the holders. the company shall cooperate fully with the holders and the underwriters in connection with any underwritten offering. notwithstanding any other provision 6 of this section 2(a), if the representative advises the holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, the securities of the company held by other stockholders shall be excluded from such registration to the extent so required by such limitation. if, after the exclusion of such shares, further reductions are still required, the number of shares included in the registration by each holder shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (based on the number of shares held by such holder), by such minimum number of shares as is necessary to comply with such request. no registrable securities or any other securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriter's marketing limitation shall be included in such registration. if any other stockholder who has requested inclusion in such registration as provided above disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such person may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company, the underwriter and the initiating holders. the securities so withdrawn shall also be withdrawn from registration. if the underwriter has not limited the number of registrable securities or other securities to be underwritten, the company and officers and directors of the company may include its or their securities for its or their own account in such registration if the representative so agrees and if the number of registrable securities and other securities which would otherwise have been included in such registration and underwriting will not thereby be limited. (b) company registration. (i) if the company shall determine to register any of its equity securities either for its own account or for the account of other stockholders, other than a registration relating solely to benefit plans, or a registration relating solely to a commission rule 145 transaction, or a registration on any registration form which does not permit secondary sales or does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of registrable securities, the company will: (a) promptly give to each of the holders a written notice thereof (which shall include a list of the jurisdictions in which the company intends to attempt to qualify such securities under the applicable blue sky or other state securities laws); and (b) include in such registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance), and in any underwriting involved therein, all the registrable securities specified in a written request or requests, made by the holders within ten (10) business days after the giving of the written 7 notice from the company described in clause (i) above, except as set forth in section 2(b)(ii) below. such written request shall specify the amount of registrable securities intended to be disposed of by a holder and may specify all or a part of the holders' registrable securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time after giving such written notice of its intention to effect such registration and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to register such equity securities the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the holders and thereupon the company shall be relieved of its obligation to register such registrable securities in connection with the registration of such equity securities (but not from its obligation to pay registration expenses to the extent incurred in connection therewith as provided herein), without prejudice, however, to the rights (if any) of holders immediately to request that such registration be effected as a registration under section 2(a) hereof. (ii) underwriting. if the registration of which the company gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the company shall so advise each of the holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to section 2(b)(i)(a). in such event, the right of each of the holders to registration pursuant to this section 2(b) shall be conditioned upon such holders' participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holders' registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. the holders whose shares are to be included in such registration shall (together with the company and the other stockholders distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the representative of the underwriter or underwriters selected for the underwriting by the company or such other stockholders, as the case may be. such underwriting agreement will contain such representations and warranties by the company and such other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation, indemnities and contribution to the effect and to the extent provided in section 2(f) hereof and the provision of opinions of counsel and accountants' letters to the effect and to the extent provided in section 2(e), and the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of the holders whose shares are to be included in such registration. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 2(b), if the representative determines that 8 marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, the company shall so advise all holders of securities requesting registration, and the number of shares of securities that are entitled to be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated in the following manner: the securities of the company held by officers, directors and other stockholders of the company (other than securities held by existing holders or holders who by contractual right demanded such registration ("demanding holders")) shall be excluded from such registration and underwriting to the extent required by such limitation, and, if a limitation on the number of shares is still required, the number of shares that may be included in the registration and underwriting by each of the holders, existing holders which are not demanding holders with respect to such registration and demanding holders with respect to such registration which are not existing holders shall be reduced, on a pro rata basis (based on the number of shares held by such holder), by such minimum number of shares as is necessary to comply with such limitation; provided, however, that in the event that an existing holder is a demanding holder with respect to such registration, the number of shares of registrable securities proposed to be included in any such registration by each holder shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (based on the number of shares held by such holder) prior to any reduction in the number of shares to be included in such registration by such demanding holder. if any of the holders or any officer, director or other stockholder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, he may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the underwriter. any registrable securities or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration. (c) shelf registration. (i) on or before july 1, 1996, the company shall file a "shelf" registration statement pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act (the "shelf registration") with respect to the registrable securities to be issued under the stock purchase agreement. the company shall (a) use its reasonable best efforts to have the shelf registration declared effective on or before the closing date (as defined in the stock purchase agreement) or as soon thereafter as practicable and (b) subject to section 2(i) hereof, use its reasonable best efforts to keep the shelf registration continuously effective from the date such shelf registration is declared effective until the date of termination of this agreement pursuant to section 2(j) hereof in order to permit the prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by holders during such period. except as set forth in section 2(c)(iii) below, the shelf registration may not include other securities of the company which are held by other stockholders. 9 (ii) subject to section 2(i) hereof, the company shall supplement or amend the shelf registration, (a) as required by the registration form utilized by the company or by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by the securities act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (b) to include in such shelf registration any additional securities that become registrable securities by operation of the definition thereof and (c) following the written request of an initiating holder pursuant to section 2(c)(iii) below, to cover offers and sales of all or a part of the registrable securities by means of an underwriting including the incorporation of any information required pursuant to section 2(e)(x) below. the company shall furnish to the holders of the registrable securities to which the shelf registration relates copies of any such supplement or amendment sufficiently in advance (but in no event less than five business days in advance) of its use and/or filing with the commission to allow the holders a meaningful opportunity to comment thereon. (iii) the holders may, at their election and upon written notice by an initiating holder to the company, subject to the limitations set forth in clauses (u), (v), (x), (y) and (z) of section 2(a)(i)(b) hereof, effect offers and sales under the shelf registration by means of one or more underwritten offerings, in which case the provisions of section 2(a)(ii) above shall apply to any such underwritten distribution of securities under the shelf registration and such underwriting shall, if sales of registrable securities pursuant thereto shall have closed, be regarded as the exercise of one of the registration rights contemplated by section 2(a) hereof. in the event of such an election, and, without the consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding registrable securities, under no other circumstances, the shelf registration may, subject to section 2(a)(ii) above, be amended to include other shares of common stock which are held by other stockholders. (d) expenses of registration. all registration expenses incurred in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this section 2 (including all registration expenses incurred in connection with the shelf registration and any supplements or amendments thereto, whether or not it becomes effective, and whether all, none or some of the registrable securities are sold pursuant to the shelf registration) shall be borne by the company, and all selling expenses shall be borne by the holders of the securities so registered pro rata on the basis of the number of their shares so registered; provided, however, that if, as a result of the withdrawal of a request for registration by any of the holders, as applicable, the registration statement does not become effective, the holders and other stockholders requesting registration may elect to bear the registration expenses (pro 10 rata on the basis of the number of their shares so included in the registration request, or on such other basis as such holders and other stockholders may agree), in which case such registration shall not be counted as a registration pursuant to section 2(a)(i)(b)(y). (e) registration procedures. in the case of each registration effected by the company pursuant to this section 2, the company will keep the holders, as applicable, advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration and as to the completion thereof. at its expense, the company will: (i) other than the shelf registration, the obligations in respect of which are set forth in section 2(c)(i)(b) above, keep such registration effective for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days or until the holders, as applicable, have completed the distribution described in the registration statement relating thereto, whichever first occurs; (ii) furnish to each holder, and to any underwriter before filing with the commission, copies of any registration statement (including all exhibits) and any prospectus forming a part thereof and any amendments and supplements thereto (including all documents incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein prior to the effectiveness of such registration statement and including each preliminary prospectus, any summary prospectus or any term sheet (as such term is used in rule 434 under the securities act)) and any other prospectus filed under rule 424 under the securities act, which documents, other than documents incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference, will be subject the review of the holders and any such underwriter for a period of at least five business days, and the company shall not file any such registration statement or such prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such registration statement or prospectus to which any holder or any such underwriter shall reasonably object within five business days after the receipt thereof; a holder or such underwriter(s), if any, shall be deemed to have reasonably objected to such filing only if the registration statement, amendment, prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to be filed, contains a material misstatement or omission; (iii) furnish to each holder and to any underwriter, such number of conformed copies of the applicable registration statement and of each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits) and such number of copies of the prospectus forming a part of such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus, any summary prospectus or any term sheet (as such term is used in rule 434 under the securities act)) and any other prospectus filed under rule 424 under the 11 securities act, in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents, including without limitation documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference prior to the effectiveness of such registration, as each of the holders or any such underwriter, from time to time may reasonably request; (iv) to the extent practicable, promptly prior to the filing of any document that is to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or prospectus forming a part thereof subsequent to the effectiveness thereof, and in any event no later than the date such document is filed with the commission, provide copies of such document to the holders, if requested, and to any underwriter, make representatives of the company available for discussion of such document and other customary due diligence matters, and include such information in such document prior to the filing thereof as any holder or any such underwriter reasonably may request; (v) make available at reasonable times for inspection by the holders, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration and any attorney or accountant retained by the holders or any such underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the company and cause the officers, directors and employees of the company to supply all information reasonably requested by the holders and any such underwriters, attorneys or accountants in connection with such registration subsequent to the filing of the applicable registration statement and prior to the effectiveness of the applicable registration statement; (vi) use its reasonable best efforts (x) to register or qualify all registrable securities and other securities covered by such registration under such other securities or blue sky laws of such states of the united states of america where an exemption is not available and as the sellers of registrable securities covered by such registration shall reasonably request, (y) to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as the applicable registration statement remains in effect, and (z) to take any other action which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such sellers to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities to be sold by such sellers, except that the company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified, or to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance, unless the company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be 12 required by the securities act or applicable rules or regulations thereunder; (vii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all registrable securities covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other federal or state governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary in the opinion of counsel to the company and counsel to the holders of registrable securities to enable the holders thereof to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities; (viii) subject to section 2(i) hereof, promptly notify each holder of registrable securities covered by a registration statement (a) upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which, the prospectus forming a part of such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (b) of the issuance by the commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation of proceedings for that purpose, (c) of any request by the commission for (1) amendments to such registration statement or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in any such registration statement, (2) supplements to the prospectus forming a part of such registration statement or (3) additional information, (d) of the receipt by the company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, and at the request of any such holder promptly prepare and furnish to it a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ix) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any such registration, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction; (x) if requested by any initiating holder, or any underwriter, promptly incorporate in such registration statement or prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if necessary, such information as the 13 initiating holder and any underwriter may reasonably request to have included therein, including, without limitation, information relating to the "plan of distribution" of the registrable securities, information with respect to the principal amount or number of shares of registrable securities being sold to such underwriter, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the registrable securities to be sold in such offering and make all required filings of any such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the company is notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; (xi) furnish to the holders, addressed to them, an opinion of counsel for the company, dated the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement, if any, or the date of effectiveness of the registration statement if such registration is not an underwritten offering, and use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the holders, addressed to them, a "cold comfort" letter signed by the independent certified public accountants who have certified the company's financial statements included in such registration, covering substantially the same matters with respect to such registration (and the prospectus included therein) and, in the case of such accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent to the date of such financial statements, as are customarily covered in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' letters delivered to underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities and such other matters as the holders may reasonably request; (xii) provide promptly to the holders upon request any document filed by the company with the commission pursuant to the requirements of section 13 and section 15 of the exchange act; and (xiii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all registrable securities included in any registration pursuant hereto to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same class are then listed or, if not then listed on any securities exchange, to be eligible for trading in any over-the-counter market or trading system in which securities of the same class are then traded. (f) indemnification. (i) the company will indemnify each of the holders, as applicable, each of its officers, directors, members and partners, and each person controlling each of the holders, with respect to each registration which has been effected pursuant to this section 2, and each 14 underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any prospectus, offering circular or other document (including any related registration statement, notification or the like) incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by the company of the securities act or the exchange act or any rule or regulation thereunder applicable to the company and relating to action or inaction required of the company in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and will reimburse each of the holders, each of its officers, directors, members and partners, and each person controlling each of the holders, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating and defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission based upon written information furnished to the company by the holders or underwriter and stated to be specifically for use therein. (ii) each of the holders will, if registrable securities held by it are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify the company, each of its directors and officers and each underwriter, if any, of the company's securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls the company or such underwriter, each other stockholder and each of their officers, directors, members and partners, and each person controlling such other stockholder against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document made by such holder, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements by such holder therein not misleading, and will reimburse the company and such other stockholders, directors, officers, partners, members, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged 15 omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder and stated to be specifically for use therein; provided, however, that the obligations of each of the holders hereunder and under clause (vi) below shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds to such holder of securities sold as contemplated herein. (iii) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 2(f) (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld) and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense (unless the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in such action, in which case the fees and expenses of one such counsel for all indemnified parties shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party), and provided further that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 2 unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. (iv) if the indemnification provided for in this section 2(f) is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such 16 proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue (or alleged untrue) statement of a material fact or the omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (v) notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with any underwritten public offering contemplated by this agreement are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in such underwriting agreement shall be controlling. (vi) the foregoing indemnity agreement of the company and holders is subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any loss, claim, liability or damage made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the commission at the time the registration statement in question becomes effective or the amended prospectus filed with the commission pursuant to commission rule 424(b) (the "final prospectus"), such indemnity or contribution agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter or holder (but only if such holder was required to deliver such final prospectus) if a copy of the final prospectus was furnished to the underwriter and was not furnished to the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such action is required by the securities act. (g) information by the holders. each of the holders holding securities included in any registration shall furnish to the company such information regarding such holder and the distribution proposed by such holder as the company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this section 2. (h) rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may permit the sale 17 of restricted securities to the public without registration, the company agrees to: (i) make and keep public information available as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act ("rule 144"), at all times; (ii) use its best efforts to file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act; and (iii) so long as the holder owns any registrable securities, furnish to the holder upon request, a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of rule 144, and of the securities act and the exchange act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents so filed as the holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing the holder to sell any such securities without registration. (i) holdback agreement; postponement. notwithstanding the provisions of sections 2(a),(b) and (c), if the board of directors of the company determines in good faith that it is in the best interests of the company (a) not to disclose the existence of facts surrounding any proposed or pending acquisition, disposition, strategic alliance or financing transaction involving the company or (b) for any purpose, to suspend the registration rights set forth herein, the company may, by notice to the holders in accordance with section 4(a), (1) suspend the rights of the holders to make sales pursuant to the shelf registration and (2) postpone any registration which is requested pursuant to section 2(a), in each case for such a period of time as the board of directors may determine; provided that (x) such periods of suspension together with any periods of suspension effected pursuant to section 2(a)(i)(b)(v) hereof may not exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any period of 12 consecutive months and (y) the company may not impose such a suspension or a postponement pursuant to section 2(a)(i)(b)(v) following the printing and distribution of a preliminary prospectus in any underwritten public offering of registrable securities pursuant to section 2(a)(i) or 2(c)(iii) (except such suspension, not to exceed 10 days, which results from an event that is not within the reasonable control of the company). notwithstanding the provisions of section 2(a)(i)(b)(v) or this section 2(i), the company shall not suspend the registration rights set forth herein at any time during which any similar rights of the existing holders are not similarly suspended. (j) termination. the registration rights set forth in section 2(a) shall not be available to any holder if, in 18 the opinion of counsel to the company, all of the registrable securities then owned by such holder could be sold in any 90-day period pursuant to rule 144 (without giving effect to the provisions of rule 144(k)). (k) assignment. the registration rights set forth in section 2 hereof may be assigned, in whole or in part, to any transferee of registrable securities (who shall be considered thereafter to be a holder (provided that any transferee who is not an affiliate of investor shall be a holder only with respect to such registrable securities so acquired and any stock of the company issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for or in replacement of, such registrable securities) and shall be bound by all obligations and limitations of this agreement). 3. interpretation of this agreement (a) directly or indirectly. where any provision in this agreement refers to action to be taken by any person, or which such person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such person. (b) governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such state. (c) section headings. the headings of the sections and subsections of this agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof. 4. miscellaneous (a) notices.
