(f) each of the directors and executive officers of the reporting person is a united states citizen. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. all 4,336,226 shares of common stock beneficially owned by the reporting person were acquired pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") dated as of april 1, 1997, by and among the issuer, the reporting person, brooks fiber communications of texas, inc., a delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer ("sub"), and metro access networks, inc. ("metro"), a delaware corporation, a majority of the $.10 par value per share common stock ("metro common stock") of which was owned by the reporting person. in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, on may 5, 1997, sub was merged with and into metro and, in connection therewith, all 3,063 shares of metro common stock owned by the reporting person were converted into 4,336,226 shares of common stock. no part of the consideration for such shares of common stock was represented by funds loaned by a bank or amounts borrowed or otherwise obtained for the purpose of acquiring such common stock. to the best of the reporting person's knowledge, none of the directors or executive officers of the reporting person own any common stock except for harvey p. perry, who acquired 500 shares of common stock with personal funds, none of which were loaned by a bank or borrowed or otherwise obtained for the purpose of acquiring such common stock. the reporting person disclaims beneficial ownership of the 500 shares of common stock held by mr. perry. item 4. purpose of transaction. the reporting person acquired 4,336,226 shares of common stock for investment purposes pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreement. metro owns and operates and has under construction fiber optic telecommunications networks in several texas metropolitan areas and has made arrangements for the provision of full local exchange switched services in such areas. the boards of directors of sub and metro determined that it was in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate a business combination transaction in which (i) sub would merge with and into metro (the "merger"), (ii) each outstanding share of common stock of sub would be converted into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation"), (iii) each outstanding share of metro common stock would be converted into a certain number of shares of common stock as determined in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement (subject to certain exceptions not applicable to the reporting person), and (iv) the name of the surviving corporation would be amended to be brooks fiber communications of texas, inc. the result of such business combination was that, in effect, the issuer acquired metro from century and the other owners of metro in exchange for the above-described consideration. the reporting person is obligated under the merger agreement to indemnify the issuer and the surviving corporation for certain losses that may arise in connection with the merger if the aggregate amount of such losses exceeds $250,000. all such losses that in the aggregate amount are equal to 4% or less of the "merger consideration" (as that term is defined in the merger agreement) must be paid by the reporting person in shares of common stock valued at $20.60 for each such share. after the reporting person has indemnified the issuer for such losses in an amount equal to 4% of the "merger consideration," the reporting person will have the option to pay for any additional indemnifiable losses in either cash or shares of common stock valued at $20.60 for each such share. all indemnifiable losses are computed net of any recovery of insurance proceeds. claims for such indemnification must be made within certain time limitations. the reporting person will not be liable for any such losses in an amount greater than the aggregate value of the 4,336,226 shares of common stock it acquired in the merger, determined at $20.60 for each such share. upon the consummation of the merger, the reporting person and the issuer entered into an affiliate agreement (the "affiliate agreement") dated as of may 5, 1997, pursuant to which the issuer agreed to maintain its registration statement no. 333-21223 on form s-4 (the "registration statement") filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") under the securities act of 1933 (the "1933 act") effective for resales of the common stock acquired in the merger by the reporting person for a period of five years following the merger. the issuer also agreed to use its best efforts to register or qualify resales of common stock by the reporting person under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the reporting person may reasonably request. if, however, the reporting person's ownership of common stock should fall below 5% of the outstanding common stock during the five-year period, the issuer's obligation with respect to maintaining the effectiveness of the registration statement would cease unless and to the extent that the volume limitations of rule 145 promulgated by the sec under the 1933 act would continue to be applicable to resales of common stock by the reporting person. in the event that a material change or development should occur that would require an amendment or supplement to the registration statement, the reporting person will suspend any resales of common stock for the period specified in the affiliate agreement. the reporting person also agreed that, in the event that it is afforded an opportunity to participate in an underwritten public offering of issuer equity securities when it owns more than 1% of the outstanding common stock, it will not, without the prior written consent of the issuer and the managing underwriters thereof, effect any public sale or distribution of common stock, other than in connection with such offering, during the period commencing seven days prior to the effective date of such offering and ending on a date between ninety and one hundred and eighty days after the effective date of such offering as selected by the managing underwriters thereof. in connection with the merger agreement, the reporting person and the issuer also entered into a stockholder agreement (the "stockholder agreement") dated as of april 1, 1997, to establish certain terms and conditions concerning the acquisition and disposition of issuer securities after the merger by the reporting person and the corporate governance of the issuer after the merger. pursuant to the requirements of the stockholder agreement, the board of directors (the "board of directors") of the issuer created two vacancies in the board of directors and elected two designees of the reporting person to fill the two vacancies and to serve until the end of their respective terms. the reporting person's designees are glen f. post, iii and w. bruce hanks, who are also directors and executive officers of the reporting person. in accordance with the provisions of the stockholder agreement, one of the nominees, mr. post, was designated as vice chairman of the board of directors. the issuer agreed that, in connection with each meeting of the issuer's stockholders at which the term of any director designated by the reporting person expires, its board of directors will nominate for election as a director of the issuer a designee of the reporting person to stand for election for a succeeding term and will vote all management proxies in favor of such nominee, except for such proxies as specifically indicated to the contrary. the issuer will also recommend its stockholders to vote in favor of such nominees and will use reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies voted in favor of such nominees. if any director designated by the reporting person should decline or be unable to serve for any reason, or if such director resigns or is removed, the board of directors will promptly upon the request of the reporting person nominate or elect a new qualified person recommended by the reporting person to replace such designee. the reporting person will cease to have the right under the stockholder agreement to designate or cause the nomination or election of any member of the board of directors when the reporting person and its affiliates beneficially own outstanding voting securities of the issuer and any issuer securities convertible or exchangeable into its voting securities that represent less than 5% of the voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the issuer. until such time as the reporting person and its affiliates beneficially own outstanding voting securities of the issuer representing less than 5% of the voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the issuer, the reporting person has agreed that it and its affiliates will vote the voting securities of the issuer held by them for the nominees recommended by the board of directors, provided such nominees include the reporting person's nominees. the reporting person and its affiliates will cause the directors designated by the reporting person to resign from the board of directors at such time as the reporting person and its affiliates beneficially own less than 5% of the voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the issuer. if, however, the reporting person's percentage of the voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the issuer is reduced below 5% as the result of an issuance of outstanding voting securities by the issuer, the reporting person will be afforded ninety days to purchase a sufficient amount of additional voting securities of the issuer necessary to maintain its level of representation on the board of directors. the issuer has the obligation under the stockholder agreement to take all necessary action to insure at all time that its certificate of incorporation and by-laws are not at any time inconsistent with the provisions of the stockholder agreement. the issuer agreed that, except as required by applicable law, rule, or regulation or the merger agreement, it will not approve or recommend to its stockholders any transaction or approve, recommend, or take any other action that would impose limitations on the legal rights of the reporting person or its affiliates as stockholders of the issuer to designate directors pursuant to the stockholder agreement, otherwise materially adversely discriminate against the reporting person or its affiliates as stockholders of the issuer, or restrict the right of any director designated by the reporting person to vote on any matter as such director believes appropriate in accordance with such designee's fiduciary duties as a director of the issuer. in accordance with the provisions of the stockholder agreement, neither the reporting person nor any of its affiliates may acquire beneficial ownership of any issuer equity securities that would cause their ownership of the voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the issuer to exceed 15% thereof without the prior consent of the board of directors except (i) in the event that the issuer receives a bona fide offer from a third party to acquire in excess of 50% of the issuer's outstanding voting securities, in which event such restriction would be temporarily waived to permit the reporting person, if it so desired, to make one or more offers to increase its ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer on the same basis as such third party offer and (ii) in the event that the reporting person exercises its right to sell its membership interests in michigan fiber communications l.l.c., a delaware limited liability company, pursuant to the provisions of the limited liability company agreement (the "limited liability company agreement") entered into between the reporting person and a subsidiary of the issuer, such restriction would be waived by the issuer if necessary to permit the reporting person to receive payment of the purchase price therefor from the issuer in shares of common stock. (the reporting person hereby agrees to furnish supplementally to the securities and exchange commission upon request a copy of the limited liability company agreement, pursuant to which the parties thereto may contribute cash or assets to construct and to operate jointly local telecommunications networks within the state of michigan.) the reporting person also agreed that, for as long as one or more of its nominees is a director of the issuer, neither it nor any of its affiliates will, and they will not assist or encourage other persons to directly or indirectly (i) acquire ownership of any substantial portion of the assets or equity securities of the issuer, (ii) engage in any solicitation of proxies or form, join, or in any way participate in a "group" (as defined under the securities exchange act of 1934) with respect to equity securities of the issuer, or (iii) subject to the obligation of its designees on the board of directors to exercise their fiduciary duties as directors, otherwise seek or propose to acquire control of the board of directors. except as described above in this item 4, there are no plans or proposals that the reporting person has or, to the best of its knowledge, that the directors and executive officers of the reporting person have that relate to or would result in (a) the acquisition of additional securities of the issuer or the disposition of securities of the issuer; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the issuer; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (f) any other material change in the issuer's business or corporate structure; (g) changes in the issuer's certificate of incorporation, by-laws, or other instruments corresponding thereto or other actions that may impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person; (h) causing a class of securities of the issuer to cease to be authorized to be quoted on the nasdaq inter-dealer quotation system; (i) a class of equity securities of the issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration under the securities exchange act of 1934; or (j) any action similar to any of the matters enumerated above. the reporting person intends, however, to review continuously all aspects of its investment in the issuer, including the issuer's business, operations, financial results and condition and prospects, the market price of the common stock, conditions in the securities markets generally, and general economic and industry conditions. the reporting person reserves the right, in light of its continuing review of these factors and in accordance with and subject to its rights and its obligations under the merger agreement, the affiliate agreement, and the stockholder agreement, to acquire additional shares of common stock, to dispose of any or all of the shares of common stock it currently holds, or otherwise to change its intention with respect to any or all of the matters referred to in this item 4. thus, based on its continuing review of its investment in the issuer, the reporting person may formulate a plan or proposal relating to one or more of the matters enumerated above. in addition, in the course of performing their duties as directors of the issuer, messrs. post and hanks may discuss one or more of the matters enumerated above with other directors of the issuer or the issuer's management or may formulate a plan or proposal relating to one or more of the matters enumerated above. the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement, the affiliate agreement and the stockholder agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, each of which is filed as an exhibit hereto and is hereby incorporated into this item 4. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.

(d) upon receipt of a notice of dispute, metro and seller shall promptly consult with the buyer with respect to its specified points of disagreement in an effort to resolve the dispute. if any such dispute cannot be resolved by the parties within ten (10) business days after metro and seller receive the notice of dispute, the parties shall refer the dispute to a partner in national firm of certified public accountants mutually agreed upon by buyer and metro (the "arbiter"), as an arbitrator to finally determine, as soon as practicable, and in any event within fifteen (15) days after such reference, all points of disagreement with respect to the march balance sheet. for purposes of such arbitration each of buyer and metro shall submit a proposed march balance sheet. metro's proposed march balance sheet need not be identical to the march balance sheet delivered pursuant to section 2.03(b). the arbiter shall conduct the arbitration under such procedures as the parties may agree or, failing such agreement, under the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association. the fees and expenses of the arbitration and the arbiter incurred in connection with the arbitration of the march balance sheet shall be allocated between buyer and seller by the arbiter in proportion to the extent either buyer or metro did not prevail on items in dispute in the march balance sheet; provided, that such fees and expenses shall not include, so long as such party complies in all material respects with the procedures of this section 2.03, the other party's outside counsel or accounting fees. all determinations by the arbiter with respect to the march balance sheet and the allocation of arbitration fees and expenses shall be final, conclusive and binding on buyer, metro and the shareholders. article iii representations and warranties of seller seller hereby makes the following representations and warranties to buyer and sub. 3.01 existence and qualification.

(c) if any adjustment is made in a pre-closing action of metro (or of seller which relates in any way to metro) resulting in a deficiency which would have required a larger tax payment by metro if such adjustment had been included in the original return, and such deficiency represents a permanent difference in tax liability, the seller shall be solely responsible for such deficiency. if the deficiency represents a timing difference in tax liability, the seller will pay to buyer an amount equal to the tax liability net of any future tax benefit to the surviving corporation, in each case discounted to present value on the date of payment from the due date of such future tax liability and tax benefit at the rate of 9% per annum.

town & country, missouri 63017 ladies and gentlemen: the undersigned has been advised that as of the date hereof it may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of metro access networks, inc., a delaware corporation ("metro"), as that term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "rules and regulations") of the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 act"). pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger dated as of april 1, 1997 (the "merger agreement"), among brooks fiber properties, inc., a delaware corporation ("bfp"), brooks fiber communications of texas, inc., a delaware corporation wholly owned by bfp ("sub"), century telephone enterprises, inc., a louisiana corporation, and metro, providing for the merger of sub with and into metro (the "merger"), and as a result of the merger, the undersigned will receive shares of bfp's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("bfp common stock"), in exchange for the shares of common stock of metro owned by the undersigned at the effective time (as defined in the merger agreement) of the merger. the undersigned represents and warrants to bfp, and bfp agrees, as follows: a. the undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the bfp common stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the merger in violation of the 1933 act or the rules and regulations. b. the undersigned has carefully read this letter and the merger agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon the ability of the undersigned to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of bfp common stock with its counsel. c. the undersigned has been advised that the issuance of bfp common stock to it pursuant to the merger has been registered with the commission under the 1933 act on bfp's registration statement no. 333- 21223 on form s-4 under the 1933 act (the "registration statement"). however, the undersigned has also been advised that, since at the time the merger was submitted for a vote of the stockholders of metro the undersigned may have been deemed to have been an affiliate of metro, the bfp common stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the merger must be held by it indefinitely unless (i) a distribution of bfp common stock by it has been registered under the 1933 act (including a distribution pursuant to the registration statement), (ii) a sale of bfp common stock by it is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of rule 145 promulgated by the commission under the 1933 act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to bfp (jones, walker, waechter, poitevent, carrere & denegre, l.l.p. is so acceptable to bfp), some other exemption from registration is available with respect to a proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of the bfp common stock by it. d. bfp shall timely file reports in compliance with the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 act"), in order that there will be publicly available current public information concerning the company within the meaning of rule 144(c) of the commission under the 1933 act, and, in connection with any proposed sale by the undersigned pursuant to rule 145 under the 1933 act, shall furnish to the undersigned upon request a written statement as to whether bfp has complied with such reporting requirements during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that bfp may have been required to file such reports). bfp hereby represents that, as of the date hereof, it is in compliance with such reporting requirements. e. the undersigned agrees to furnish bfp in writing such information as bfp may reasonably request and which is customary in connection with any resales of bfp common stock pursuant to the registration statement. in the event a material(1) change or development should occur that, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for bfp, would require an amendment or supplement to the registration statement, the undersigned shall, upon receipt of written notice from bfp, suspend all such resales pursuant to the registration statement until the earlier of (i) two business days after bfp files with the commission its next report on form 8-k or its next quarterly or annual report under the 1934 act on form 10-q or 10-k, or (ii) bfp has advised the undersigned that the registration statement may again be used for such resales. in such event, at the request of the undersigned, bfp shall promptly prepare and furnish to the undersigned a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment to the prospectus then included as part of the registration statement which appropriately reflects such change or development for delivery to purchasers of the bfp common stock from the undersigned. bfp shall keep the registration statement effective for use in connection with resales for a period of up to five years following the effective time; provided, however, that if during such five-year period the undersigned's ownership of bfp common stock falls below 5% of the outstanding shares of bfp common stock (and, as a result thereof, the undersigned is no longer permitted to designate two bfp directors under the stockholder agreement dated as of april 1, 1997 by and between bfp and the undersigned), the undersigned understands that the registration statement will not be kept effective for resales by the undersigned unless and to the extent the volume limitations of rule 145 continue to be applicable to sales by the undersigned of shares of bfp common stock acquired in the merger. as soon as reasonably practicable following the earliest date permitted under regulation c promulgated under the 1933 act, bfp shall amend the registration statement to enable bfp to disclose information with respect to its business in accordance with item 10 of form s-4 under the 1933 act. in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement, or of any order suspending or preventing the use of any related prospectus or suspending the qualification of any bfp common stock registered under such registration statement for sale in any jurisdiction, bfp agrees to use its reasonable best efforts promptly to obtain the withdrawal of such order. ________________________________ (1) information is material when "there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important" (tsc industries, inc. v. northway, 426 u.s. 438, 449, 1976) or if there is "a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the `total mix' of information made available" (basic, inc. v. levison, 485 u.s. 224, 231-232, 1988). f. in connection with any underwritten offering by the undersigned pursuant to the registration statement, bfp agrees to amend or supplement the registration statement at the reasonable request of the undersigned or its underwriters and to otherwise cooperate with the undersigned and its underwriters in connection with any such offering; provided, however, that the underwriters of any such offering shall be reasonably acceptable to bfp. bfp further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify resales of bfp common stock by the undersigned under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the undersigned reasonably requests and is legally required to do so and to take any and all other acts that may be necessary to enable the undersigned to consummate such resales in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that bfp will not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this sentence, file a general consent to service of process or subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where bfp would not otherwise be subject to taxation. g. in the event of an underwritten public offering of any bfp equity securities by bfp or any of its other stockholders, in which the undersigned is offered the opportunity to participate and at a time when the undersigned owns more than 1% of the outstanding shares of bfp common stock, the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of bfp and the managing underwriters of such offering, effect any public sale or distribution of its bfp common stock during the period commencing on the seventh day prior to, and ending on the ninetieth day (or such longer period up to 180 days as shall be required by the managing underwriters) following, the effective date of such underwritten public offering, except in connection therewith. h. the undersigned also understands that stop transfer instructions will be given to bfp's transfer agents with respect to the bfp common stock acquired by the undersigned in connection with the merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for such bfp common stock, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: "the shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which rule 145 promulgated under the 1933 act applies. the shares represented by this certificate may only be transferred in accordance with the terms of an agreement dated may 5, 1997 (the "agreement"), between the registered holder hereof and brooks fiber properties, inc. (the "corporation"), a copy of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of the corporation. the agreement permits a sale of the shares represented by this certificate (i) pursuant to the corporation's registration statement on form s-4 (no. 333-21223) and (ii) in conformity with the volume and other limitations of rule 145(d). i. the undersigned also understands that unless the transfer by it of its bfp common stock is pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 act (including the registration statement) or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of rule 145, bfp reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to any transferee: "the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which rule 145 promulgated under such act applies. the shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of such act and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of such act." it is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs h and i above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend in the event of a distribution by the undersigned pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 act (including the registration statement) or as otherwise permitted by rule 145 or if (i) the undersigned shall have delivered to bfp a copy of a letter from the staff of the commission, or an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to bfp, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 act, (ii) a period of at least one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the bfp common stock received in the merger and the provisions of rule 145(d)(2) are then applicable to the undersigned, (iii) a period of at least two years shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the bfp common stock received in the merger and the provisions of rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to the undersigned, or (iv) rule 145 shall have been amended such that the volume limitations thereof no longer apply to sales by the undersigned of shares of bfp common stock acquired in the merger. execution of this letter agreement should not be considered an admission on the part of the undersigned that it is an "affiliate" of the company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, or as defined under rule 144 of the 1933 act, nor as a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have to object to any claim that it is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter. this letter agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure the benefit of, the undersigned and bfp and their respective successors. very truly yours, century telephone enterprises, inc. /s/ glen f. post, iii by:__________________________________ glen f. post, iii vice chairman, president and chief executive officer accepted and agreed as of this 5th day of may, 1997, by: brooks fiber properties, inc. /s/ james c. allen by:_______________________________ james c. allen vice chairman and chief executive officer ex-2 4 exhibit 2.3 - stockholder agreement stockholder agreement by and between brooks fiber properties, inc. and century telephone enterprises, inc. dated as of april 1, 1997 table of contents page no. article i defintions...................................................1 1.01 definitions......................................................1 article ii board of directors.........................................3 2.01 composition of board of directors................................3 2.02 resignations and designations....................................4 2.04 certificate of incorporation and by-laws.........................5 2.05 certain restrictions.............................................5 article iii century's rights to purchase additional equity securities;

(b) thereafter, and subject to the next succeeding sentence, the board of directors (or any committee of the board of directors which nominates directors) shall, in connection with each meeting of stockholders of bfp at which the term of any century director expires, nominate for election as a director of bfp, in accordance with bfp's procedures for nomination of directors as provided for in its by-laws, a designee of century to stand for election for a succeeding term, and shall vote all management proxies in favor of such nominee, except for such proxies that specifically indicate to the contrary. bfp shall recommend its stockholders to vote in favor of such nominees, and shall use reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies voted in favor of such nominees. notwithstanding the foregoing, century shall cease to have the right to designate, or cause the nomination or election of any member of the board of directors from and after such date as the restricted group beneficially owns outstanding voting securities representing less than 5% of the voting power of all outstanding voting securities. the obligation of the board of directors hereunder to nominate for election as directors individuals designated by century shall be subject to the foregoing limitation. (c) until such time as the restricted group beneficially owns outstanding voting securities representing less than 5% of the voting power of all outstanding voting securities, if any director designated by century in accordance with this section 2.01 shall decline or be unable to serve for any reason, or if such director resigns or is removed, the board of directors shall promptly upon the request of century nominate or elect, as the case may be, a new qualified person recommended by century to replace such designee.
