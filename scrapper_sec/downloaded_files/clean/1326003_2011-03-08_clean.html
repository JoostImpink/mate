(b) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; priority on incidental registration .&#160;&#160;if the sole or managing underwriter of a registration advises the company in writing that in its opinion the number of registrable securities and other securities requested to be included exceeds the number of registrable securities and other securities which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the distribution of the securities being offered, the price that will be paid in such offering or the marketability thereof, the company will include in such registration the registrable securities and other securities of the company in the following order of priority: &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 7 such other registration rights based on the respective amounts of registrable securities hereunder and registrable securities (as defined in the other registration rights agreement) and securities subject to such other registration rights held by each such holder. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;upon delivering a request under this section 2.3, a covered person (excluding vestar and its affiliates, but including any other permitted transferee of any thereof) will, if requested by the company, execute and deliver a custody agreement and power of attorney in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company and vestar with respect to such covered person&#8217;s securities to be registered pursuant to this section 2.3 (a &#8220;

follow-on holdback period &#8221;), except as part of any such underwritten registration (or for such shorter period as to which the managing underwriter or underwriters may agree, provided that such shorter period applies equally to all covered persons).&#160;&#160;if (i)&#160;the company issues an earnings release or discloses other material information or a material event relating to the company occurs during the last 17 days of a follow-on holdback &#160;

provided, that the failure of the indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this article ii, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. &#160; in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party&#8217;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified party and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.&#160;&#160;it is understood and agreed that the indemnifying person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. any such separate firm (x) for any covered person, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such indemnified party shall be designated in writing by the requesting holder, (y) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the board.&#160;&#160;the indemnifying person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying person agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying person shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (a) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (b) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 14 such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.&#160;&#160;the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties&#8217;

the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.&#160;&#160;no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160;
