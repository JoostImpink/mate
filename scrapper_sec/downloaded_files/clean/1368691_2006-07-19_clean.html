the reporting person identified on pages 2 through 7 to this schedule 13d hereby makes the following statement (this "statement") pursuant to section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. &#160; -1- &#160; item 1. security and issuer &#160; this statement relates to the common stock, $.001 par value per share (the "common stock"), of valley forge composite technologies, inc., formerly known as quetzal capital 1, inc., a florida corporation (the "issuer"). as of july 6, 2006, the issuer's principal executive office was located at 628 jamie circle, king of prussia, pennsylvania 19406. &#160; item 2. identity and background &#160; this statement is being filed by louis j. brothers and his wife rosemary a. brothers as tenants by the entirety (the "reporting person"). &#160; louis j. brothers is the chief executive officer, president, and chairman of the board of directors of the issuer. rosemary a. brothers is a homemaker. mr. and mrs. brothers are u.s. citizens. &#160; the reporting person has not, during the last five years (a) been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (b) been a party to any civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction, and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree, or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. &#160; item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration &#160; valley forge composite technologies, inc. was formed as a pennsylvania corporation in november 1996 (hereafter the pennsylvania corporation is referred to as &#8220;vfct&#8221;). louis j. brothers is a founder of vfct, and he and mrs. brothers were original shareholders. until vfct&#8217;s merger by share exchange with quetzal capital i, inc., a florida corporation on july 6, 2006 (the &#8220;share exchange&#8221;), vfct was a private company. louis j. brothers contributed both his labor and personal funds during the approximately ten years of vfct&#8217;s existence. as a result, at the time of the share exchange, louis j. brothers and rosemary a. brothers owned 47.2% of vfct&#8217;s common stock. as a result of the share exchange, mr. and mrs. brothers&#8217; interest in vfct was exchanged for 38% of the common stock of quetzal capital 1, inc. &#160; item 4. purpose of the transaction &#160; the purpose of the share exchange is to provide the shareholders of vfct with control of a publicly reporting company that eventually will become a publicly trading company. this will enable vfct and/or its shareholders to: a) have greater access to capital and greater opportunity or flexibility to acquire or merge with other companies through the use of the company&#8217;s securities; b) have greater liquidity of stockholdings; c) use common stock and other securities as a means of compensation; and d) enhance the prestige and publicity of the company. &#160; the reporting person intends that in the immediate future the issuer will seek additional investors to contribute capital in exchange for equity interests in the issuer, that in the near future the issuer will file a registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission to register some of its shareholders&#8217; equity interests in the issuer; and that the issuer will seek to obtain a trading symbol and have the price of its common stock quoted in the over the counter bulletin board. &#160; -2- &#160; item 5. interest in securities of the issuer &#160; (a) as of july 6, 2006, the issuer had 50,000,000 shares outstanding. as a result of the share exchange, the reporting person directly owns 18,880,000 shares of the issuer&#8217;s common stock, which is the equivalent of 38% of the outstanding common stock of the issuer. &#160; (b) as of july 6, 2006, the reporting person had sole power to vote and to dispose or direct the disposition of direct the disposition of 18,880,000 shares of the issuer&#8217;s common stock, which is the equivalent of 38% of the outstanding common stock of the issuer. &#160; (c) on july 6, 2006, the share exchange occurred, which resulted in a change of control of the issuer. on the effective date of the share exchange, and pursuant to the share exchange agreement, vfct became a wholly-owned subsidiary of quetzal capital 1, inc. (previously defined as the &#8220;issuer&#8221; above). the issuer will continue its corporate existence as a florida corporation while vfct will continue its corporate existence under the laws of the state of pennsylvania as a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the issuer. each share of vfct common stock issued and outstanding at the effective time of the share exchange will automatically be converted into the right to receive 40,000 shares of issuer common stock upon completion of the share exchange. each share of issuer common stock issued and outstanding at the effective date of the share exchange will remain issued and outstanding as one share of common stock of the issuer. for a complete discussion, please refer to the form 8-k and its attached exhibits filed by the issuer july 11, 2006, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. following the share exchange, assuming full participation by the former vfct stockholders, the former vfct stockholders will become the controlling stockholders of issuer, owning 80% of the outstanding common stock of the issuer, and their designees, louis j. brothers, larry k. wilhide, and randy broadright, will become the directors and/or officers of the issuer. &#160; item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer &#160; louis j. brothers has an agreement with rosemary a. brothers to vote her interest in the reporting person&#8217;s securities as his own. &#160; -3- &#160; item 7. material to be filed as exhibits &#160; exhibit 1. form 8-k filed july 11, 2006 by valley forge composite technologies, inc.
