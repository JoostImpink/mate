(f) mr. horejsi, ms. ciciora and dr. sippy are each citizens of the united states. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. the total amount of funds required by the mildred trust to purchase the shares as reported in item 5(c) was $7,330,716.96. such funds were provided by the mildred trust's cash on hand and margin borrowings under an account maintained by merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated ("merrill lynch"). the mildred trust's margin borrowings from merrill lynch bear interest at the federal funds rate plus 40 basis points and are due on demand. such margin borrowings are based on the collateral in the account maintained by the mildred trust. the foregoing description of the mildred trust's account agreement with merrill lynch is qualified in its entirety by reference to the cash management account agreement attached as exhibit 1. item 4. purpose of transaction the mildred trust acquired the shares reported in item 5(c) in order to acquire an equity ownership of the company. the mildred trust may seek to increase its interest so as to acquire control of the company. depending upon its evaluation of the company's investments and prospects, and upon future developments (including, but not limited to, performance of the company's equity securities, including the shares in the market, effective yield on the shares or other equity securities, availability of funds, alternative uses of funds, leveraged assets, money, stock market and general economic conditions), any of the reporting persons or other horejsi family controlled entities or trusts that may act with the reporting persons (collectively referred to as the "other trusts") may from time to time purchase the company's equity securities, including the shares, and any of the reporting persons or other horejsi family controlled entities or other trusts may from time to time dispose of all or a portion of the equity securities or shares held by such person, or cease buying or selling shares or other equity securities. any such additional purchase or sale of the shares or equity securities may be in open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. historically, when the mildred trust and the other trusts have taken large stakes in companies similar to the company, they have nominated and elected to the companies' boards directors whom they know, trust, and in whom they have confidence with regard to company-related business decisions. consistent with this, the mildred trust may nominate new trustees, reduce the number of overall trustees from 11 to 5 to ensure a better functioning board of trustees, propose terminating the existing investment manager, propose replacing the existing administrator, and propose a change to the company's investment objective. in the past, the mildred trust and certain of the other trusts successfully gained control of the boards of btf, bif and first financial fund, inc. ("ff"). in the case of btf and bif, the ernest horejsi trust no. 1b (the "ernest trust") and the lola brown trust no. 1b (the "lola trust") recommended, and the respective boards and a majority of the funds' respective shareholders agreed, that, among other changes, bia and sia should replace the prior investment advisers of these funds and that the funds' investment objectives or restrictions should be changed. the ernest trust and the lola trust were able to successfully prevent the renewal of the investment advisory agreement for bif (which formerly traded under the name "us life income fund, inc."), while holding approximately 20% of the voting shares of this fund. subsequent to this, the ernest trust's and the lola trust's proposals to change the investment objectives, replace the investment adviser, amend bif's fundamental investment restrictions, and implement certain other changes were adopted by shareholders. in the case of ff, the ernest trust and the lola trust concluded that the incumbent adviser should be retained and the fund's investment objective left unchanged, and ff's newly elected board concurred. for bif, btf and ff, the respective boards retained fund administrative services, llc ("fas"), which is owned by the lola trust and indirectly by certain other horejsi family trusts, as administrator for these funds. the reporting persons may propose that the company replace the current adviser with bia and sia, replace the current administrator with fas, and may propose a different or expanded investment objective for the company. in any decision, the reporting persons would consider market conditions at the time and the performance of the incumbent adviser. the reporting persons oppose proposals to open-end or merge the company into an open-end fund, including the company's announced proposal to merge into a putnam open-fund. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) the mildred trust is the direct beneficial owner of 531,263 shares or approximately 19.10% of the 2,780,987 shares outstanding as of october 31, 2006 (the "outstanding shares"), according to information contained in the company's semi-annual report to shareholders. by virtue of the relationships reported in this statement, mr. horejsi may be deemed to share indirect beneficial ownership of the shares directly beneficially owned by the mildred trust. mr. horejsi disclaims all such beneficial ownership. (b) the mildred trust has the direct power to vote and direct the disposition of the shares held by it. by virtue of the relationships described in this statement, mr. horejsi and the trustees may be deemed to share the indirect power to vote and direct the disposition of the shares held by the mildred trust or other trusts, but each of mr. horejsi and the trustees disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares or any other equity securities in the company. based on its previous experiences with other closed-end funds (bif, btf, and ff), the mildred trust and other trusts believe that its acquisition of approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of the company will enable it to prevent the merger into another putnam fund and enable the trust to implement the purpose of its transaction as discussed in item 4, above.

by subscribing to the cma visa gold program i agree that i will not dispose of my assets in my cma service account or any other account i may have with wither mlpf&s or mlnf, if such disposal will
