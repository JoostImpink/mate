shall not give the holders of such options additional benefits or additional vesting rights (other than rights to the acceleration of vesting or the lapse of the right of repurchase caused by the merger under existing contractual arrangements) which they did not have immediately prior to the effective date or relieve the holders of any obligations or restrictions applicable to their options or the shares obtainable 6 13 upon exercise of the options. after the effective date, the stock option plans shall be continued in effect by parent subject to amendment, modification, suspension,

(e) if any claim shall be brought against an indemnified party, parent shall assume the defense thereof with counsel of its selection, and shall have absolute discretion to settle any claims, and each indemnified party shall cooperate with the defense or settlement thereof. after parent has assumed the defense of such claim, parent shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this section 8.5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently 30 37 incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. section 8.6. hsr act. the company and parent shall use their best efforts to file as soon as practicable notifications under the hsr act in connection with the merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the department of justice for additional information or documentation and to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries and requests received from any state attorney general or other governmental authority in connection with antitrust matters. section 8.7. additional agreements.
