by the issuer of a proposal by santander to acquire the issuer that is made in compliance with the restrictions set forth in, and that the issuer is required to accept under the terms of, the investment agreement; (iii) the issuer&#146;s consummation of an acquisition proposal made by a third party (other than santander); or (iv) the breach of certain covenants of the investment agreement by the issuer (the &#147;standstill termination date&#148;), santander cannot: &#149; acquire additional voting securities of the issuer except as specifically provided for in the investment agreement (such as in connection with its right to increase its ownership percentage to 24.99% or its gross-up rights); &#149; make an acquisition proposal to the issuer; or &#149; engage in the solicitation of proxies with respect to the issuer or participate in any group engaging in any such proxy solicitation. in addition, from the standstill termination date until santander owns less than 10% of the outstanding shares and has no representative on the board of directors of the issuer, santander will not take any &#147;hostile action&#148; (e.g., make an unsolicited acquisition proposal or acquire the issuer securities without the consent of the issuer&#146;s board of directors, or engage in or participate in a proxy solicitation against an action of the issuer&#146;s board of directors). general non-solicitation restrictions from the closing on may 31, 2006 to the earlier of (i) the standstill termination date or (ii) such time as santander and its affiliates hold less than 19.8% of the issuer&#146;s outstanding common stock, the issuer may not solicit, respond to or accept a third party proposal to acquire the issuer or grant to any third party any waiver or release under any of its anti-takeover defensive measures except as permitted by the investment agreement (including in accordance with the procedures described below during the standstill periods). page 5 of 16 first standstill period procedures from the closing through the second anniversary of the closing, the investment agreement provides, among other things, that: &#149; santander may not make an acquisition proposal to the issuer, unless invited by the issuer to do so. &#149; the issuer may solicit santander to make an acquisition proposal, which proposal may be subject to any conditions specified by the issuer. &#149; the issuer may not solicit acquisition proposals from any third party. &#149; the issuer can respond to unsolicited proposals from third parties, but santander would then have a right of first negotiation for 30 days and a right to match any third party proposal, and if the issuer enters into an acquisition agreement with a third party or removes or waives any anti-takeover defensive measure, the restrictions imposed on santander with respect to the sale of the shares would then terminate. &#149; if the issuer accepts a santander acquisition proposal, (i) the issuer will sign an exclusive acquisition agreement with santander (i.e., the issuer&#146;s board of directors will not be allowed to solicit third parties&#146; offers or entertain any unsolicited offers from third parties with respect to such proposed agreement); (ii) the issuer&#146;s board of directors will vote to approve the exclusive acquisition agreement; and (iii) the issuer&#146;s board of directors will convene a shareholders meeting and, subject to its fiduciaries duties, will recommend that the shareholders approve the agreement. the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the issuer&#146;s common stock not held by santander and its affiliates will be required to approve the acquisition agreement. &#149; subject to santander&#146;s right of first negotiation and santander&#146;s right to match any third party proposal, if the third party proposal is higher than santander&#146;s offer, the issuer may accept the third party proposal; the transaction would be submitted to the issuer&#146;s shareholders, and santander would be obligated to vote its shares for and against the proposal in the same proportion as the remaining shareholders of the issuer vote

market check process involving the solicitation of firm third party offers or in an appraisal process involving the valuation of the issuer by investment banks or other appraisers. &#149; if santander agrees to pay the higher of &#36;40 and the price resulting from the appraisal process or the market check process, as the case may be, or if the parties otherwise agree on the terms of a santander acquisition proposal, (i) the issuer will sign an exclusive acquisition agreement with santander; (ii) the issuer&#146;s board of directors will vote to approve the exclusive acquisition agreement; and (iii) the issuer&#146;s board of directors will convene a shareholders meeting and, subject to its fiduciaries duties, will recommend that shareholders approve the agreement. the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the issuer&#146;s common stock not held by santander and its affiliates will be required to approve the acquisition agreement. &#149; if the issuer receives an unsolicited acquisition proposal from a third party, santander has a right of first negotiation for 30 days and, if santander makes an offer that is greater than &#36;40 per share, the issuer would be obligated to complete the process described above (e.g., negotiate with santander, and if an agreement is not reached, perform an appraisal process or market check process). if santander does not make such an offer, or does page 6 of 16 not agree to pay the higher of &#36;40 per share and the price resulting from the appraisal process or the market check process, as the case may be, and subject to a last look right to match the third party offer, the issuer would be free to accept the third party offer and, if it does, santander would be obligated to vote its shares at any shareholders&#146; meeting held to approve such third party offer in the same proportion as the issuer&#146;s other shareholders vote. the issuer is not be permitted in any case to accept an unsolicited offer from a third party at a price per share of &#36;40 or less. third standstill period procedures from the third anniversary of the closing until the fifth anniversary of the closing, the investment agreement provides, among other things, that: &#149; santander can make an offer to acquire the issuer at any price, but the issuer can defer any negotiations with santander once for a period of up to 270 days. &#149; the issuer can invite santander to make a proposal, but santander can defer any negotiations for a period of up to 270 days. &#149; upon the receipt of an acquisition proposal from santander, the issuer and santander will negotiate exclusively (either immediately or after any deferral period) for a period of up to 90 days. &#149; if the parties are unable to agree on the terms of a santander proposal, the issuer will engage in either the market check process or the appraisal process described above in &#147;second standstill period procedures.&#148; &#149; if santander agrees to pay the price resulting from the appraisal process or the market check process, as the case may be, or if the parties otherwise agree on the terms of santander&#146;s acquisition proposal, (i) the issuer will sign an exclusive acquisition agreement with santander; (ii) the issuer&#146;s board of directors will vote to approve the exclusive acquisition agreement; and (iii) the issuer&#146;s board of directors will convene a shareholders meeting and, subject to its fiduciaries duties, will recommend that shareholders approve the agreement. the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issuer&#146;s common stock not held by santander and its affiliates will be required to approve the acquisition agreement. &#149; if the issuer receives an unsolicited acquisition proposal from a third party, santander has a right of first negotiation for 30 days, and if it makes an offer, the issuer would be obligated to complete the process described above (e.g., negotiate with santander, and if an agreement is not reached, perform an appraisal process or market check process). if santander does not make such an offer, or does not agree to pay the price resulting from the appraisal process or the market check process, as the case may be, and subject to a last look right to match the third party offer, the issuer would be free to accept the third party offer and, if it does, santander would be obligated to vote its shares at any shareholders&#146; meeting held to approve such third party offer in the same proportion as the issuer&#146;s other shareholders vote. &#149; if the issuer invites santander to make an acquisition proposal but santander does not do so (either within ten business days of such invitation or within ten business days of the expiration of its 270 day deferral period), the issuer may solicit acquisition proposals from third parties. transfer restrictions from the closing until the earlier of: (i) the fifth anniversary of the closing, (ii) the

recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction approved by a majority of the members of the issuer&#146;s board of directors that are not affiliated with santander, (b) to an affiliate, or (c) pursuant to a bona fide pledge to a financial institution. page 7 of 16 after the sale restriction termination date, santander shall have the right to: &#149; transfer its shares to an affiliate of santander; &#149; sell its shares in a registered public offering (including in connection with the exercise of registration rights received from the issuer under the registration rights agreement), using its reasonable efforts not to materially disrupt the public market for the issuer&#146;s common stock and to minimize the possibility that any person who purchases such common stock shall become a holder of more than 5% of the issuer&#146;s outstanding common stock after such purchase; &#149; subject to compliance with rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and other applicable securities laws, sell its shares in the public markets, on the same basis as described in the bullet point immediately above; &#149; subject to a right of first offer and, in

the issuer may provide to santander; &#149; sell its shares in connection with a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, tender offer or other similar transaction approved by a
