("north castle partners"), a private investment firm specializing in acquisition transactions. purchaser was formed at the direction of north castle partners to effect the proposed transactions described in item 4 below and has not engaged in any activities other than those incident to its formation and such proposed transactions. the principal business address of each of the reporting persons is c/o north castle partners, l.l.c., 60 arch street, greenwich, ct 06830. the present principal occupation of mr. baird is managing director of north castle partners. mr. baird is a citizen of the united states. during the last five years, none of the reporting persons has been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors), or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. 8 9 item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. as more fully described in item 4 hereof, purchaser and each of the stockholders listed on schedule a hereto (the "continuing stockholders") have entered into separate voting agreements (as such term is defined in item 4) with respect to the merger (as described in item 4). the continuing stockholders each entered into the voting agreements to induce purchaser to enter into the merger agreement (as such term is defined in item 4), as such, no funds were expended by any of the reporting persons in connection with the voting agreements. item 4. purpose of the transaction. on january 5, 2000, purchaser, ncp-sbg recapitalization corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of purchaser ("mergerco"), and the company entered into a stock purchase agreement and agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") providing for the merger of mergerco with and into the company (the "merger"), whereupon the separate existence of mergerco will cease and the company will continue as the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation"). at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than (i) up to 700,000 shares of common stock owned by the continuing stockholders, (ii) shares of common stock owned by the company and (iii) shares of common stock subject to dissenters' rights) will be converted into the right to receive $6.00 in cash without interest. in the merger, up to 700,000 shares of common stock owned by the continuing stockholders will be converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of the surviving corporation. immediately after the merger, purchaser will purchase shares of common stock of the surviving corporation (the "stock purchase") for a per share consideration of $6.00. as a result of the merger and the stock purchase, purchaser and the continuing stockholders will hold approximately 90% and 10% of the common stock of the surviving corporation, respectively. the obligations of the parties to the merger agreement to effect the merger are subject to certain conditions, and prior to the effective time purchaser or the company may terminate the merger agreement under certain conditions, in each case as set forth in the merger agreement. because approval of the company's stockholders is required by applicable law in order to consummate the merger, the company will submit the merger to its stockholders 9 10 for approval. in anticipation of this requirement, concurrently with and as a further condition to the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, purchaser and each of the continuing stockholders entered into separate voting agreements, each dated as of january 5, 2000 (the "voting agreements"). subject to the terms and conditions of the voting agreements, the continuing stockholders have appointed purchaser as their irrevocable proxy to vote in the aggregate 2,400,217 shares (the "shares") of the common stock, representing approximately 43.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of january 4, 2000 (based on the number of shares of common stock represented by the company in the merger agreement), and representing approximately 58.8% of the aggregate voting power of the common stock (see item 5(b)), in favor of the merger and of certain related agreements and actions and against certain other enumerated actions or agreements. if the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (including upon acceptance by the board of directors of the company of a superior acquisition proposal), the covenants and agreements in the voting agreements with respect to the shares will also terminate at such time. subject to the foregoing and to certain exceptions and conditions, the continuing stockholders have agreed pursuant to the voting agreements to refrain from soliciting or responding to certain inquiries or proposals regarding the company, to restrictions on transfer of the shares, to waive any rights of appraisal available in the merger with respect to the shares and to take or refrain from taking certain other actions. the voting agreements provide purchaser with sufficient voting power to cause the merger agreement to be adopted and to approve the merger at a duly convened meeting of the stockholders of the company. at the effective time, (i) the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the company, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will be amended and restated as set forth in exhibits a and b, respectively, of the merger agreement and, as so amended and restated, will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the surviving corporation, (ii) the members of the board of directors of mergerco at the effective time will become the directors of the surviving corporation and (iii) the officers of the company at the effective time will remain the officers of the surviving corporation. after the effective time, pursuant to the stockholders agreement, dated as of january 5, 2000 and effective as of the effective time (the "stockholders agreement"), among the company, purchaser and the continuing stockholders, four of the directors will be nominated by purchaser and three directors will be nominated by the surviving corporation's chief executive officer. in addition, pursuant to the stockholders agreement, the continuing stockholders have agreed to certain transfer restrictions on their shares of common stock in the surviving corporation. as contemplated by the stockholders agreement, north castle and the continuing stockholders currently intend that the surviving corporation will serve as the platform company to acquire other companies in the refrigerated juice industry. 10 11 if consummated, the merger and the stock purchase will result in purchaser and its affiliates becoming the controlling stockholders of the company. no shares of the surviving corporation will continue to be (i) listed on the nasdaq national market system or (ii) registered under the exchange act. the preceding summary of certain provisions of the merger agreement, the voting agreements and the stockholders agreement is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, copies of which are incorporated herein by reference. other than as described above, none of the reporting persons has any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions described in this item 4 (although subject to the provisions of the merger agreement, they reserve the right to develop such plans). item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) and (b). as of january 5, 2000, no reporting person owned any shares of common stock. however, as of january 5, 2000, under the definition of "beneficial ownership" as set forth in rule 13d-3 under the exchange act, by virtue of the terms of the voting agreements, purchaser may be deemed to have beneficially owned the shares subject to the voting agreements, constituting in the aggregate 2,400,217 (or approximately 43.2%) of the outstanding shares of common stock (based on the number of shares of common stock represented by the company in the merger agreement as outstanding as of january 4, 2000). of the shares subject to the voting agreements, 1,877,262 are class a common stock and 522,955 are class b common stock. each share of class a common stock entitles the holder to one vote and each share of class b common stock entitles the holder to five votes at each annual or special meeting of stockholders, in the case of any written consent of stockholders, and for all other purposes, including the election of directors of the company. the class a common stock and class b common stock are substantially identical except for disparity in voting power, and the holders of class a common stock and class b common stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders (including the merger) except as otherwise provided by law. due to the disparate voting power of the class a common stock and class b common stock, the shares subject to the voting agreements as to which purchaser may be deemed to have beneficial ownership represent 58.8% of the aggregate voting power of the company. 11 12 none of the reporting persons has any right to dispose or direct the disposition of any of the shares, except that the voting agreements impose certain limitations on transfer of the shares by the continuing stockholders. the general partner of purchaser is sbg, l.l.c. the sole member of sbg, l.l.c. is north castle fund. the general partner of north castle fund is gp ii, l.p. the general partner of gp ii, l.p. is gp ii, l.l.c. the sole member of gp ii, l.l.c. is mr. baird. the action of the general partner or sole member of each such entity is sufficient to cause the limited partnership or limited liability company, as applicable, to take action. therefore, mr. baird and each such entity may be deemed to have the shared power to direct the voting of the shares subject to the voting agreements. mr. baird is the senior managing member of north castle partners and, as such, has management control of north castle partners. each reporting person other than purchaser disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares. (c) except as set forth in this item 5, to the best knowledge of each reporting person, none of the reporting persons has beneficial ownership of, or has engaged in any transaction during the past 60 days in, any shares of common stock. (d) none of the reporting persons, to the best knowledge of each reporting person, has the right to receive or to the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the shares. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. except as set forth in this statement, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, there are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the company, including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities of the company, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, or a pledge or contingency, the occurrence of which would give another person voting power over the securities of the company. 12 13 item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. 1. stock purchase agreement and agreement and plan of merger, dated as of january 5, 2000, among saratoga beverage group,

recommendation of a special committee of independent directors of the company (the "special committee"), has approved, and deems it advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders of the

the company, based upon the unanimous recommendation of the special committee, and the board of directors of mergerco have each approved this agreement and the merger of mergerco with and into the company in accordance with the terms of this agreement and the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"); whereas, in connection with the recapitalization, purchaser desires to purchase and the

dated as of the date hereof (the "voting agreements"), with each of the continuing stockholders (as defined herein), pursuant to which the continuing stockholders agree to vote their shares of common

hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 7 article i merger; purchase of shares 1.1 merger; purchase of shares. (a) on the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the dgcl, at the effective time, mergerco shall be merged (the "merger") with and into the company and the separate corporate existence of mergerco shall cease. after the merger, the company shall continue as the surviving corporation (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "surviving corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the state of delaware. the merger shall have the effect as provided in the applicable provisions of the dgcl. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the merger, all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the company and mergerco shall vest in the surviving corporation and all restrictions, obligations, duties, debts and liabilities of the company and mergerco shall be the restrictions, obligations, duties, debts and liabilities of the surviving corporation. (b) on the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, immediately after the effective time, the surviving corporation shall, in consideration for the payment of the purchase price, issue, transfer, deliver and sell to purchaser and purchaser shall purchase and accept from the surviving corporation (the "stock purchase") the purchased shares. the "purchase price" shall mean $28,660,000, provided that if the full amount (the "debt commitment amount") of the debt financing contemplated by the letters referred to in section 3.6(ii) and (iii) is unavailable at the effective time from the financial institutions party to such letters or from other financing sources on terms substantially similar to the terms contained in such letters or on less favorable terms that are acceptable to purchaser, then the "purchase price" shall equal the sum of (x) $28,660,000 and (y) 90% of the positive difference between (a) the debt commitment amount and (b) the amount of debt financing actually obtained at the effective time, provided, further, that the "purchase price" shall not exceed $38,660,000 under any circumstance. purchaser shall provide written notice to the company two business days prior to the effective time of the purchase price. 1.2 issuance of purchased shares and cash payment. at the closing (i) the surviving corporation shall deliver to purchaser certificates representing the purchased shares, duly authorized and issued in blank, free and clear of all liens and (ii) purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the surviving corporation the purchase price by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account or accounts designated at least three business days prior to the closing by the company in a written notice to purchaser. 2 8 1.3 conversion or cancellation of shares. the manner of converting or canceling shares of company common stock and shares of common stock of mergerco in the merger shall be as follows: (a) at the effective time, each share of class a common stock of the company, par value $.01 per share (the "class a common stock") and class b common stock of the company, par value $.01 per share (the "class b common stock", and together with the class a common stock, the "company common stock") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares that are held by stockholders (the "dissenting stockholders") exercising appraisal rights with respect to such shares pursuant to section 262 of the dgcl) shall, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, without interest: (i) with respect to each such share held by any non-continuing stockholder, cash in an amount equal to the per share merger consideration; (ii) with respect to each cashed out share held by any continuing stockholder, cash in an amount equal to the per share merger consideration; and (iii) with respect to each rollover share held by any continuing stockholder, a number of shares of surviving corporation common stock equal to the quotient of (x) the per share merger consideration divided by (y) the per share amount. (b) notwithstanding the foregoing, no fractions of a share of surviving corporation common stock shall be issued in the merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of company common stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of surviving corporation common stock shall, upon surrender of his or her certificate or certificates, be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the per share amount by the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. (c) at the effective time, each share of company common stock issued and held in the company's treasury immediately prior to the effective time shall, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 3 9 (d) at the effective time, each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of mergerco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of mergerco or the holders thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(a) prior to the effective time, mergerco shall designate the company's registrar and transfer agent or such other bank or trust company as may be approved in writing by the company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), to act as exchange agent for the holders of shares of company common stock in connection with the merger (the "exchange agent"), to receive the certificates representing the shares of surviving corporation common stock and the funds to which holders of shares of company common stock shall become entitled pursuant to this article i. on or prior to the effective time, the company will deposit in trust with the exchange agent, for the benefit of holders of company common stock, (i) the funds necessary to complete the payments contemplated by this article i and (ii) the certificates representing the shares of surviving corporation common stock to be issued hereunder. (b) at the effective time, the surviving corporation will instruct the exchange agent to promptly, and in any event not later than three business days following the effective time, mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the effective time represented outstanding shares of company common stock, whose shares were converted pursuant to section 1.3 into the right to receive the merger consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as mergerco and the company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such certificates in exchange for the merger consideration (which shall provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder, such certificates may be surrendered, and payment therefor collected, by hand delivery). upon surrender of such certificates for cancellation to the exchange agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the company, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration specified in section 1.3 for each share of company common stock formerly represented 4 10 by such certificate, to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within three business days of receipt thereof, and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. if payment of the merger consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the merger consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the surviving corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. until surrendered as contemplated by this section 1.4, each certificate (other than certificates representing dissenting shares) shall be deemed at any time after the effective time to represent only the right to receive the merger consideration as contemplated by this section 1.4. (c) in the event any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the merger consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this article i, provided that the person to whom the merger consideration is paid shall, as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, give the surviving corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct or otherwise indemnify the surviving corporation in a manner satisfactory to it against any claim that may be made against the surviving corporation with respect to the certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. (d) any portion of the funds deposited with the exchange agent (and the proceeds of any interest and other income received by the exchange agent in respect of all such funds) and any certificates representing shares of surviving corporation common stock that remain unclaimed by the former stockholders of the company one year after the effective time shall be delivered to the surviving corporation. any former stockholders of the company who have not theretofore complied with this article i shall thereafter look only to the surviving corporation for payment of any merger consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any certificates such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this agreement, without any interest thereon. (e) none of mergerco, the company, the surviving corporation, the exchange agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of company common stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 5 11 (f) any payment or issuance made pursuant to this section 1.4 shall be subject to and made net of applicable withholding taxes. 1.5 options; warrants; 2000 note.

(b) at or immediately prior to the effective time, all warrants to purchase shares of company common stock (each such warrant, a "company stock warrant") outstanding under the warrant issued to global financial group and any other outstanding company stock warrant, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be repurchased or canceled, and the surviving corporation shall pay each such holder at or promptly after the effective time for each such warrant an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the per share exercise price of such warrant by (ii) the number of shares of company common stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all warrants) had such holder exercised such warrants in full immediately prior to the effective time, such amount subject to any required withholding. the company shall use its best efforts to obtain all necessary consents of the holders of company stock warrants to the cancellation or repurchase of such warrants on the terms provided in the preceding sentence. (c) at or immediately prior to the effective time, the 2000 note shall be repurchased or canceled, and the surviving corporation shall pay the holder thereof at or promptly after the effective time an amount in cash equal to (x) the quotient of (i) 1.5 million plus a number equal to the amount of accrued but unpaid interest on the 2000 note through the effective time divided by (ii) 3.5, multiplied by (y) the per share merger consideration, such amount subject to any required withholding. the company shall use its best efforts to obtain all necessary consents of the holder of the 2000 note to 6 12 the cancellation or repurchase of the 2000 note on the terms provided in the preceding sentence. 1.6 dissenting shares. notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, shares of company common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and that are held by stockholders who have perfected any dissenters' rights provided under the dgcl, if applicable (the "dissenting shares"), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the merger consideration unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to appraisal and payment under the dgcl. if such holder shall have so failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the effective time, the right to receive the merger consideration, without any interest thereon. 1.7 certificate of incorporation; by-laws. (a) the certificate of incorporation of the company as in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall, in accordance with the terms thereof and the dgcl, be amended and restated as set forth in exhibit a and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation until duly amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the dgcl.

was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the corporation as a director or officer, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, and may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to such an action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was or has agreed to become an employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful; except that in the case of an action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor (1) such indemnification shall be limited to expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in the defense or settlement of such action or suit, and (2) no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the delaware court of 16 89 chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the delaware court of chancery or such other court shall deem proper. the termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. section 6.02. successful defense. to the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in section 6.01 hereof or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. section 6.03. determination that indemnification is proper. any indemnification of a director or officer of the corporation under section 6.01 hereof (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation unless a determination is made that indemnification of the director or officer is not proper in the circumstances because he has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in section 6.01 hereof. any indemnification of an employee or agent of the corporation under section 6.01 hereof (unless ordered by a court) may be made by the corporation upon a determination that indemnification of the employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in section 6.01 hereof. any such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders. section 6.04. advance payment of expenses. expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this article. such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the board 17 90 of directors deems appropriate. the board of directors may authorize the corporation's counsel to represent such director, officer, employee or agent in any action, suit or proceeding, whether or not the corporation is a party to such action, suit or proceeding. section 6.05. procedure for indemnification of directors and officers. any indemnification of a director or officer of the corporation under sections 6.01 and 6.02, or advance of costs, charges and expenses to a director or officer under section 6.04 of this article, shall be made promptly, and in any event within 30 days, upon the written request of the director or officer. if a determination by the corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this article is required, and the corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for indemnity, the corporation shall be deemed to have approved such request. if the corporation denies a written request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within 30 days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this article shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the corporation. it shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under section 6.04 of this article where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in section 6.01 of this article, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in section 6.01 of this article, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. section 6.06. survival; preservation of other rights. the foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each director, officer, employee and agent who serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the delaware corporation law are in effect and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. such a "contract right" may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such director, officer, employee or agent. 18 91 the indemnification provided by this article vi shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. section 6.07. insurance. the corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him or on his behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this article, provided that such insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be made by a vote of a majority of the entire board of directors. section 6.08. severability. if this article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director or officer and may indemnify each employee or agent of the corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. article vii offices section 7.01. registered office. the registered office of the corporation in the state of delaware shall be located at corporation trust center, 1209 orange street in the city of wilmington, county of new castle. section 7.02. other offices. the corporation may maintain offices or

(b) obligation to effect registration. within 10 days after receipt by the company of any request for registration pursuant to section 3.1(a), the company shall 6 132 give written notice of such requested registration to all holders, and thereupon will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of: (i) the registrable securities which the company has been so requested to register pursuant to section 3.1(a); and (ii) all other registrable securities which the company has been requested to register by the holders thereof by written request given to the company within 20 days after the company has given such written notice (which request shall specify the intended method of disposition of such registrable securities), all to the extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the registrable securities so to be registered. notwithstanding the preceding sentence: (x) the company shall not be required to effect a registration requested pursuant to section 3.1 if the aggregate number of registrable securities referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this section 3.1(b) included in such registration shall be less than 10% of the number of purchased shares (as defined in the recapitalization agreement); and (y) if the board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with a firm of nationally recognized underwriters, that there will be an adverse effect on a then-contemplated initial public offering of the common stock, the holders requesting such registration shall be given notice of such fact and shall be deemed to have withdrawn such request and such registration shall not be deemed to have been effected or requested pursuant to this section 3.1; and (z) the company shall be entitled to postpone for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 180 days from the date a request pursuant to section 3.1(a) is received, the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to this section 3.1, if the board of directors of the company (i) in good faith determines at such time that such registration and offering would materially adversely affect or interfere with any proposed or pending financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction or the conduct or outcome of any material litigation involving the company or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) as promptly as practicable gives the relevant holders written notice of such postponement, setting forth the duration of and reasons for such postponement; provided, however, that the company shall not effect such a postponement more than once in any 360 day period. if the company shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, the holder or holders making the 7 133 request pursuant to section 3.1(a) shall within 10 days after receipt of the notice of postponement advise the company in writing whether or not it has determined to withdraw its request for registration. failure by such holder or holders to timely notify the company of its determination shall for all purposes be treated as a withdrawal of the request for registration. in the event of a withdrawal, such request for registration shall not be deemed exercised for purposes of determining whether such holder or holders still have the right to make a request for registration pursuant to this section 3.1. (c) registration statement form. each registration requested pursuant to this section 3.1 shall be effected by the filing of a registration statement on form s-1, form s-2 or form s-3 (or any other form which includes substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement on such forms as presently constituted), unless the use of a different form is (i) required by law or (ii) permitted by law and agreed to in writing by the holders of at least a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities as to which registration has been requested pursuant to this section 3.1. at any time after the company has issued and sold any shares of its capital stock registered under an effective registration statement under the securities act, or after the company shall have registered any class of equity securities pursuant to section 12 of the exchange act, it will use its reasonable best efforts to qualify for registration on form s-2 or form s-3 (or any other comparable form hereinafter adopted). (d) expenses. the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with (i) the first four registrations that are effected as requested under section 3.1(a)(i). the registration expenses in connection with each other registration, if any, requested under this section 3.1 shall be apportioned among the holders whose registrable securities are then being registered, on the basis of the respective amounts of registrable securities then being registered by them or on their behalf. however, in the case of all registrations requested under section 3.1(a), the company shall pay all amounts in respect of (i) any allocation of salaries of personnel of the company and its subsidiaries or other general overhead expenses of the company and its subsidiaries or other expenses for the preparation of financial statements or other data normally prepared by the company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) the expenses of any officers' and directors' liability insurance, (iii) the expenses and fees for listing the securities to be registered on each exchange on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed or, if no such securities are then listed, on an exchange selected by the company, and (iv) all fees associated with filings required to be made with the nasd (including, if applicable, the fees and expenses of any "qualified independent underwriter" and its counsel as may be required by the rules and regulations of the nasd). notwithstanding the provisions of this section 3.1(d) or of section 3.2, each 8 134 seller of registrable securities shall pay all registration expenses to the extent required to be paid by such seller by applicable law. (e) inclusion of other securities. the company shall not register securities (other than registrable securities) for sale for the account of any person other than the company in any registration requested pursuant to section 3.1(a) unless permitted to do so by the written consent of holders holding at least a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities proposed to be sold in such registration. (f) effective registration statement. a registration requested pursuant to section 3.1(a) shall not be deemed to have been effected unless it is declared effective by the sec and remains effective for the period specified in section 3.3(b). notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a registration requested pursuant to section 3.1(a) that does not become effective after the company has filed a registration statement with respect thereto by reason of the refusal to proceed of the holder or holders of the registrable securities requesting registration shall be deemed to have been effected by the company at the request of such holder or holders. (g) pro rata allocation. if the holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities for which registration is being requested pursuant to section 3.1(a) determine, based on consultation with the managing underwriters or, in an offering which is not underwritten, with an investment banker, that the number of securities to be sold in any such offering should be limited due to market conditions or otherwise, holders of registrable securities proposing to sell their securities in such registration shall share pro rata in the number of securities being offered (as determined by the holders holding a majority of the registrable securities for which registration is being requested in consultation with the managing underwriters or investment banker, as the case may be) and registered for their account, such sharing to be based on the number of registrable securities as to which registration was requested by such holders. 3.2 incidental registration. if the company at any time proposes to register any of its equity securities (as defined in the exchange act) under the securities act (other than pursuant to section 3.1 or pursuant to a special registration), whether or not for sale for its own account, and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of registrable securities, it shall each such time give prompt written notice to all holders of registrable securities of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of any holder of registrable securities given to the company within 30 days after the company has given any such notice (which request shall specify the registrable securities intended to be disposed of by such holder and the intended method of disposition thereof), the company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of all registrable securities which the company has been so requested 9 135 to register by the holders thereof, to the extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the registrable securities so to be registered, provided that: (a) if such registration shall be in connection with the initial public offering, the company shall not include any registrable securities in such proposed registration if the board shall have determined, after consultation with the managing underwriters for such offering, that it is not in the best interests of the company to include any registrable securities in such registration, provided that, if the board makes such a determination, the company shall not include in such registration any securities not being sold for the account of the company; (b) if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to register such securities, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each holder that was previously notified of such registration and, thereupon, shall not register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but shall nevertheless pay the registration expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any holders to request that a registration be effected under section 3.1; (c) if the company shall be advised in writing by the managing underwriters (or, in connection with an offering which is not underwritten, by an investment banker) that in their or its opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration (whether by the company, pursuant to this section 3.2 or pursuant to any other rights granted by the company to a holder or holders of its securities to request or demand such registration or inclusion of any such securities in any such registration) exceeds the number of such securities which can be sold in such offering: (i) the company shall include in such registration the number (if any) of registrable securities so requested to be included which in the opinion of such underwriters or investment banker, as the case may be, can be sold and shall not include in such registration any securities (other than securities being sold by the company, which shall have priority in being included in such registration) so requested to be included other than registrable securities unless all registrable securities requested to be so included are included therein; and 10 136 (ii) if in the opinion of such underwriters or investment banker, as the case may be, some but not all of the registrable securities may be so included, all holders of registrable securities requested to be included therein shall share pro rata in the number of shares of registrable securities included in such public offering on the basis of the number of registrable securities requested to be included therein by such holders, provided that, in the case of a registration initially requested or demanded by a holder or holders of securities other than registrable securities, the holders of the registrable securities requested to be included therein and the holders of such other securities shall share pro rata (based on the number of shares if the requested or demanded registration is to cover only common stock and, if not, based on the proposed offering price of the total number of securities included in such public offering requested to be included therein), and the company shall so provide in any registration agreement hereinafter entered into with respect to any of its securities; and (d) if prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company is informed by the managing underwriter (or, in connection with an offering which is not underwritten, by an investment banker) that the price at which such securities are to be sold is a price below that price which the requesting holders shall have indicated to be acceptable, the company shall promptly notify the requesting holders of such fact, and each such requesting holder shall have the right to withdraw its request to have its registrable securities included in such registration statement. the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with each registration of registrable securities requested pursuant to this section 3.2. no registration effected under this section 3.2 shall relieve the company from its obligation to effect registrations upon request under section 3.1. the company shall not be obligated to cause any "incidental" registration to be underwritten. 3.3 registration procedures. if and whenever the company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of any registrable securities under the securities act as provided in sections 3.1 and 3.2, the company shall: (a) subject to clauses (x), (y) and (z) of section 3.1(b), prepare and file with the sec, as soon as practicable, a registration statement with respect to such securities, make all required filings with the nasd and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; 11 137 (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith and such other documents as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement until such time as all of such securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement, but in no event for a period of more than six months after such registration statement becomes effective; (c) furnish to counsel (if any) selected by the holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement copies of all documents proposed to be filed with the sec in connection with such registration, which documents will be subject to the review of such counsel; (d) furnish to each seller of registrable securities, without charge, such number of conformed copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each case, including all exhibits and documents required to be filed therewith (other than those filed on a confidential basis), except that the company shall not be obligated to furnish any seller of securities with more than two copies of such exhibits and documents), such number of copies of the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus) in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents, as such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the securities owned by such seller; (e) use its reasonable best efforts (x) to register or qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as each seller shall request, (y) to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as such registration statement remains in effect and (z) to do any and all other acts and things which may be necessary or advisable to enable such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities owned by such seller, except that the company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified, subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so subject, or take any action which would subject it to general service of process in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so subject; 12 138 (f) in connection with a public offering only, use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each seller of registrable securities a signed counterpart, addressed to the sellers, copies of: (i) an opinion of counsel for the company experienced in securities law matters, dated the effective date of the, and (ii) a "comfort" letter signed by the independent public accountants who have issued an audit report on the company's financial statements included in the registration statement, each covering substantially the same matters with respect to the registration statement (and the prospectus included therein) and, in the case of such accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent to the date of such financial statements, as are customarily covered in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities; (g) (i) notify each holder of registrable securities subject to such registration statement if such registration statement, at the time it or any amendment thereto became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, upon discovery by the company of such material misstatement or omission, and, as promptly as practicable, prepare and file with the sec a post-effective amendment to such registration statement and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such post-effective amendment to become effective such that such registration statement, as so amended, shall not contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) notify each holder of registrable securities subject to such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, if the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, upon discovery by the company of such material misstatement or omission or upon discovery by the company of the happening of any event as a result of which the company believes there would be a material misstatement or omission, and, as promptly as is practicable, prepare and furnish to such holder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to, or an amendment of, such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to 13 139 purchasers of such securities as required under the securities act, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (h) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the sec, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement of the company complying with the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and rule 158 under the securities act; (i) notify each holder of any registrable securities covered by such registration statement (i) when such registration statement, or any post-effective amendment to such registration statement, shall have become effective, or any amendment of or supplement to the prospectus used in connection therewith shall have been filed, (ii) of any request by the sec to amend such registration statement or to amend or supplement such prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the sec of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes, and (iv) of the suspension of the qualification of such securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the institution of any proceedings for any of such purposes; (j) use its reasonable best efforts (i) (a) to list such securities on any securities exchange on which the common stock is then listed or, if no common stock is then listed, on an exchange selected by the company, if such listing is then permitted under the rules of such exchange or (b) if such listing is not practicable or the board determines that quotation as a nasdaq national market system security is preferable, to secure designation of such securities as a nasdaq "national market system security" within the meaning of rule 11aa2-1 under the exchange act and (ii) to provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for such registrable securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement; and (k) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the lifting of any stop order that might be issued suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, provided that if the company is unable to obtain the lifting of any such stop order in connection with a registration pursuant to section 3.1(a), the request for 14 140 registration shall not be deemed exercised for purposes of determining whether such registration has been effected for purposes of section 3.1(a) or (d). the company may require each holder of any registrable securities as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the company such information regarding such holder and the distribution of such securities as the company may from time to time reasonably request in writing and as shall be required by law or regulations of the sec in connection therewith. each such holder agrees to furnish promptly to the company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the company by such holder not materially misleading. the company agrees not to file or make any amendment to any registration statement with respect to any registrable securities, or any amendment of or supplement to the prospectus used in connection therewith, which refers to any seller of any securities covered thereby by name, or otherwise identifies such seller as the holder of any securities of the company, without the consent of such seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, except that no such consent shall be required for any disclosure that is required by law or regulations of the sec. by the acquisition of registrable securities, each holder shall be deemed to have agreed that upon receipt of any notice from the company pursuant to section 3.3(g), such holder will promptly discontinue such holder's disposition of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such registrable securities until such holder shall have received, in the case of clause (i) of section 3.3(g), notice from the company that such registration statement has been amended, as contemplated by section 3.3(g); or, in the case of clause (ii) of section 3.3(g), copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 3.3(g). if so directed by the company, each holder will deliver to the company (at the company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, in such holder's possession of the prospectus covering such registrable securities at the time of receipt of such notice. in the event that the company shall give any such notice, the period mentioned in section 3.3(b) shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when each seller of any registrable securities covered by such registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 3.3(g). although shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain options are included in the definition of registrable securities, the company shall, in respect of any such registrable securities requested to be registered pursuant hereto, be required to include in any registration statement only shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such options and only if the company has received assurances, 15 141 reasonably satisfactory to it, that such options will be exercised promptly after such registration statement has become effective or the sale to an underwriter has been consummated so that only common stock shall be distributed to the public under such registration statement. 3.4 underwritten offerings. the provisions of this section 3.4 do not establish additional registration rights but instead set forth procedures applicable, in addition to those set forth in sections 3.1 through 3.3, to any registration that is an underwritten offering. (a) underwritten offerings exclusive. whenever a registration requested pursuant to section 3.1 is for an underwritten offering, only securities that are to be distributed by the underwriters may be included in the registration. (b) underwriting agreement. if requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering by holders pursuant to a registration requested under section 3.1, the company shall enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters for such offering, such agreement to be reasonably satisfactory in substance and form to the holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities to be covered by such registration and to the underwriters and to contain such representations and warranties by the company and such other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in section 3.7, provisions for the delivery of officers' certificates, opinions of counsel and accountants' "comfort" letters and hold-back arrangements. the holders of registrable securities to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to such underwriting agreement and may, at their option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters be made to and for the benefit of such holders and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement shall also be conditions precedent to the obligations of such holders. if any condition to the obligations under such underwriting agreement are not met or waived, and such failure to be met or waived is not attributable to the fault of the holders requesting a demand registration pursuant to section 3.1(a), such request for registration shall not be deemed exercised for purposes of determining whether such registration has been effected for purposes of section 3.1. no such holder shall be required by the company to make any representations or warranties to, or agreements with, the company or the underwriters other than as set forth in sections 3.4(e) and 3.7(b), and representations, warranties or agreements regarding such holder and such holder's intended method of distribution and any other representations required by applicable law. 16 142 (c) selection of underwriters. whenever a registration requested pursuant to section 3.1(a) is for an underwritten offering, the company shall have the right to select one or more underwriters to administer the offering at least one of which shall be an underwriter of nationally recognized standing satisfactory to the holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities to be included in such registration. if the company at any time proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act for sale for its own account and such securities are to be distributed by or through one or more underwriters, the company shall have the right to select one or more underwriters to administer the offering at least one of which shall be an underwriter of nationally recognized standing. (d) incidental underwritten offerings. subject to the provisions of the proviso to the first sentence of section 3.2, if the company at any time proposes to register any of its equity securities under the securities act (other than pursuant to section 3.1 or pursuant to a special registration), whether or not for its own account, and such securities are to be distributed by or through one or more underwriters, the company will give prompt written notice to all holders of its intention to do so and, if requested by any holder, will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for such underwriters to include the registrable securities to be offered and sold by such holder among those to be distributed by such underwriters. the holders of registrable securities to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to the underwriting agreement between the company and such underwriters and may, at their option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such holders and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the underwriters under such underwriting agreement shall also be conditions precedent to the obligations of such holders. no such holder shall be required by the company to make any representations or warranties to, or agreements with, the company or the underwriters other than as set forth in sections 3.4(e) and 3.7(b), and representations, warranties or agreements regarding such holder and such holder's intended method of distribution and any other representations required by applicable law. (e) hold back agreements. if and whenever the company proposes to register any of its equity securities under the securities act, whether or not for its own account (other than pursuant to a special registration), or is required to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of any registrable securities under the securities act pursuant to section 3.1 or 3.2, each holder, if required by the managing underwriter in an underwritten offering, agrees by acquisition of such registrable securities not to effect (other than pursuant to such registration) any public sale or distribution, including, but not limited to, any sale pursuant to rule 144 or rule 144a, of any registrable securities, any other equity securities of the company or any securities convertible into or exchangeable 17 143 or exercisable for any equity securities of the company for 180 days after, and during the 20 days prior to, the effective date of such registration, to the extent timely notified in writing by the company or the managing underwriter, and the company agrees to cause each holder of any equity security, or of any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity security, of the company purchased from the company at any time other than in a public offering to enter into a similar agreement with the company. the company further agrees not to effect (other than pursuant to such registration or pursuant to a special registration) any public sale or distribution, or to file any registration statement (other than such registration or a special registration) covering any, of its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the 20 days prior to, and for 180 days after, the effective date of such registration if required by the managing underwriter. 3.5 preparation; reasonable investigation. in connection with the preparation and filing of each registration statement registering registrable securities under the securities act, the company shall give the holders of such registrable securities so to be registered and their underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel and accountants, the reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of such registration statement, each prospectus included therein or filed with the sec, and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and shall give each of them such access to all pertinent financial, corporate and other documents and properties of the company and its subsidiaries, and such opportunities to discuss the business of the company with its officers, directors, employees and the independent public accountants who have issued audit reports on its financial statements as shall be necessary, in the opinion of such holders' and such underwriters' respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the securities act. 3.6 other registrations. if and whenever the company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of any registrable securities under the securities act pursuant to section 3.1 or 3.2, and if such registration shall not have been withdrawn or abandoned, the company shall not be obligated to and shall not file any registration statement with respect to any of its securities (including registrable securities) under the securities act (other than a special registration), whether of its own accord or at the request or demand of any holder or holders of such securities, until a period of 180 days shall have elapsed from the effective date of such previous registration, and the company shall so provide in any registration rights agreement with respect to any of its equity securities. 18 144 3.7 indemnification.

(b) indemnification by the sellers. in the event of any registration of any registrable securities under the securities act pursuant to section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4(d), each of the prospective sellers of such securities, will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each director of the company, each officer of the company who shall sign such registration statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the company or any such participating person within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the company or any such director, officer, employee, participating person or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or otherwise (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees of legal counsel incurred in connection with any claim for indemnity hereunder), insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act, any prospectus or preliminary prospectus included therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact with respect to such seller required to be stated in any such registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, amendment or supplement or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such seller expressly for use in the preparation of any such registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided that the liability of each such seller shall be in proportion to and limited to the net amount received by such seller (after deducting any underwriting discount and expenses) from the sale of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer, employee, participating person or controlling person.

(b) the company shall issue new certificates for registrable securities without a legend restricting further transfer under the securities act if (i) such securities have been sold to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act (other than form s-8 if the holder of such registrable securities is an affiliate of the company) or rule 144, or (ii) (x) such issuance is otherwise permitted under the securities act, (y) the holder of such shares has delivered to the company an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the company, to such effect, and (z) the holder of such shares expressly requests the issuance of such certificates in writing. 22 148 4.2 amendments and waivers. this agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented, and the company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the company shall have obtained the written consent to such amendment, action or omission to act, of ncp-sbg and the holders of a majority of the registrable securities held by the continuing stockholders. notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a registration statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other holders may be given by holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities being sold by such holders pursuant to such registration statement; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. no amendment, modification or discharge of this agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing. any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party or parties granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. 4.3 beneficial owners. for the purposes of this agreement, the "holder" or "owner" of any registrable securities that are custody shares shall be the beneficial owner of such custody shares and custody shares shall be deemed "held" or "owned" by the beneficial owner thereof. in the event that any other registrable securities are held by a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof, the beneficial owner thereof may, at its election and unless notice is otherwise given to the company by the record owner, be treated as the holder of such registrable securities for purposes of any request or other action by any holder or holders pursuant to this agreement or any determination of any number or percentage of shares of registrable securities held by any holder or holders contemplated by this agreement. if the beneficial owner of any registrable securities so elects, the company may require assurances reasonably satisfactory to it of such owner's beneficial ownership of such registrable securities. 4.4 successors, assigns and transferees. this agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and transferees. in addition, and whether or not any express assignment shall have been made, the provisions of this agreement which are for the benefit of the parties hereto other than the company shall also be for the benefit of and enforceable by any subsequent holder of any registrable securities, subject to the provisions respecting the minimum numbers or percentages of shares of registrable securities required in order to be entitled to certain rights, or take certain actions, contained herein. 23 149 4.5 notices. all notices, requests, demands, waivers and other communications required or permitted to be given under this agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if (a) delivered personally, (b) mailed, certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, (c) sent by next-day or overnight mail or delivery or (d) sent by fax, with a copy sent by (a), (b), or (c) above, or telegram, as follows: (i) if to the company: saratoga beverage group, inc. 11 geyser road saratoga springs, ny 12366 fax: (518) 584-0386 tel: (518) 584-6363 x-11 attention: robin prever (ii) if to ncp-sbg or ncp-cofund, to such holder: c/o north castle partners, l.l.c. 60 arch street greenwich, ct 06830 fax: (203) 618-1860 tel.: (203) 862-3200 attention: peter j. shabecoff with a copy to: debevoise & plimpton 875 third avenue new york, new york 10022 fax: (212) 909-6836 tel.: (212) 909-6486 attention: franci j. blassberg, esq.

(a) if for any reason the indemnity provided for in section 7 is unavailable other than pursuant to its express terms, or is insufficient to hold harmless any indemnitee from any of the obligations covered by such indemnity, then the company shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnitee as a result of such obligation in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and the indemnitees, on the other, in connection with the state of facts giving rise to such obligation, (ii) if such obligation results from, arises out of, is based upon or relates to the merger, stock purchase or any securities offering, the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and the indemnitees, on the other, from the merger, stock purchase or securities offering, and (iii) if required by applicable law, any other relevant equitable considerations. (b) for purposes of section 8(a), the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and of the indemnitees, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, their respective relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct the state of facts giving rise to such obligation. for purposes of section 8(a), the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and the indemnitees, on the other, shall be determined by weighing the direct monetary proceeds to the company, on the one hand, and the indemnitees, on the other, from the merger, stock purchase or securities offering. 10 183 (c) the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to section 8(a) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in such section. the company shall not be liable under section 8(a) for contribution to the amount paid or payable by any indemnitee except to the extent and under such circumstances that the company would have been liable to indemnify, defend and hold harmless such indemnitee under section 7, if such indemnity were enforceable under applicable law. no indemnitee shall be entitled to contribution from the company with respect to any obligation in the event that any indemnitee is finally judicially determined to be guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) in connection with such obligation and the company is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 9. indemnification procedures. (a) whenever any indemnitee shall have actual knowledge of the reasonable likelihood of the assertion of a claim, north castle (acting on its own behalf or, if requested in writing by any such indemnitee other than itself, on behalf of such indemnitee) or such indemnitee shall notify the company in writing of the claim (the "notice of claim") with reasonable promptness after such indemnitee has such knowledge relating to such claim and has notified north castle thereof. the notice of claim shall specify all material facts known to north castle (or if given by such indemnitee, such indemnitee) that may give rise to such claim and the monetary amount or an estimate of the monetary amount of the obligation involved if north castle (or if given by such indemnitee, such indemnitee) has knowledge of such amount or a reasonable basis for making such an estimate. the failure of north castle or such indemnitee to give such notice of claim shall not relieve the company of its indemnification obligations under this agreement except to the extent that such omission results in a failure of actual notice to the company and the company is materially prejudiced as a result of the failure to give such notice of claim. the company shall, at its expense, undertake the defense of such claim with attorneys of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to north castle. north castle may participate in such defense with counsel of north castle's choosing at the expense of the company. if in the exercise of their good faith judgment any one or more other indemnitee reasonably determines that the claim presents an actual or potential conflict of interest with north castle, such indemnitee or indemnitees may participate in the defense of the claim with one counsel for all such indemnitees, at the choosing of such indemnitees and at the expense of the company. in the event that the company does not undertake the defense of the claim within a reasonable time after north castle has given the notice of claim, or in the event that north castle shall in good faith determine that the defense of any claim by the company is inadequate or may conflict with the interests of any indemnitee, north castle may, at the expense of the company and after giving notice to the company of such 11 184 action, undertake the defense of the claim and compromise or settle the claim, all for the account of and at the risk of the company. in the defense of any claim, the company shall not, except with the consent of north castle (or, in the case of any entry of any judgment or settlement that is binding on any other indemnitee, such other indemnitee), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that includes any injunctive or other non-monetary relief, or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the person or persons asserting such claim to such indemnitee of a release from all liability with respect to such claim. in each case, north castle and each other indemnitee seeking indemnification hereunder will cooperate with the company, so long as the company is conducting the defense of the claim, in the preparation for and the prosecution of the defense of such claim, including making available evidence within the control of north castle or such indemnitee, as the case may be, and persons needed as witnesses who are employed by north castle or such indemnitee, as the case may be, in each case as reasonably needed for such defense and at cost, which cost, to the extent reasonably incurred, shall be paid by the company. (b) the company hereby agrees to advance costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by north castle (acting on its own behalf or, if requested by any such indemnitee other than itself, on behalf of such indemnitee) or any indemnitee in defending any claim in advance of the final disposition of such claim upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of north castle or such indemnitee to repay amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that north castle or such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the company as authorized by this agreement. (c) each indemnitee shall notify the company in writing of the amount of any claim actually paid by such indemnitee (the "notice of payment"). the amount of any claim actually paid by an indemnitee shall bear simple interest at the rate equal to the bank of america prime rate as of the date of such payment plus 2% per annum, from the date the company receives the notice of payment to the date on which the company shall repay the amount of such claim plus interest thereon to such indemnitee. 10. certain covenants. the company agrees to perform its obligations under this agreement. the rights of each indemnitee to be indemnified under any other agreement, document, certificate or instrument or applicable law are independent of and in addition to any rights of such indemnitee to be indemnified under this agreement. the rights of each indemnitee and the obligations of the company hereunder shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such indemnitee. the company shall implement and maintain in full force and effect any and all corporate articles or charter and by-law provisions that may be necessary or appropriate to 12 185 enable it to carry out its obligations hereunder to the fullest extent permitted by applicable corporate law, including without limitation a provision of its articles or certificate of incorporation eliminating liability of a director for breach of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permitted by applicable corporate law, as it may be amended from time to time. 11. third-party beneficiaries. all indemnitees not signatories to this agreement are intended third-party beneficiaries of this agreement. 12. severability. if any provision or provisions of this agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 13. notices. all notices, requests, demands, waivers and other communications required or permitted to be given under this agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if (a) delivered personally, (b) mailed, certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, (c) sent by next-day or overnight mail or delivery or (d) sent by fax, with a copy sent by (a), (b), or (c) above, or telegram, as follows: if to the company, to: saratoga beverage group, inc. 11 geyser road saratoga springs, ny 12366 telephone: (518) 584-6363 x11 telecopy: (518) 584-0380 attention: chief executive officer if to north castle or any other indemnitee, to: north castle partners, l.l.c. 60 arch street greenwich, ct 06830 telephone: (203) 862-3200 telecopy: (203) 618-1860 attention: peter j. shabecoff 13 186 with a copy to: debevoise & plimpton 875 third avenue new york, new york 10022 telephone: (212) 909-6000 telecopy: (212) 909-6836 attention: franci j. blassberg or, in each case, at such other address as may be specified in writing to the other party hereto. all such notices, requests, demands, waivers and other communications shall be deemed to have been received (w) if by personal delivery on the day after such delivery, (x) if by certified or registered mail, on the seventh business day after the mailing thereof, (y) if by next-day or overnight mail or delivery, on the day delivered, (z) if by telecopy or telegram, on the next day following the day on which such telecopy or telegram was sent, provided that a copy is also sent by certified or registered mail. 14. entire agreement. this agreement (a) contains the complete and entire understanding and agreement of north castle and the company with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, conditions and agreements, oral or written, express or implied, in respect of the subject matter hereof, including but not limited to in respect of the engagement of north castle in connection with the subject matter hereof. the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any party or indemnitee may otherwise have at law or in equity or otherwise, including, without limitation, pursuant to the registration rights agreement and the stockholders agreement, each dated as of the date hereof, by and between the company, ncp-sbg and the other parties thereto. there are no representations or warranties of north castle in connection with this agreement or the services to be provided hereunder, except as expressly made and contained in this agreement. 14 187 15. headings. the headings contained in this agreement are for purposes of convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this agreement. 16. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 17. binding effect;
