(d) &#151; (e) during the last five years, the reporting person, nor to the best of the reporting person&#146;s knowledge, any of the executive officers has not (1) been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (2) has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject, to federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws, except as follows: auction rate securities: ubs was sued by four state regulatory authorities and was the subject of investigations by the sec and other regulators, relating to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities (arss) to clients and to ubs&#146;s role and participation in ars auctions and underwriting of arss. ubs was also named in several putative class actions and individual civil suits and a large number of individual arbitrations. the regulatory actions and investigations and the civil proceedings followed the disruption in the markets for these securities and related auction failures since mid-february 2008. plaintiffs and the regulators generally sought rescission, i. e., for ubs to purchase the arss that ubs sold to them at par value, as well as compensatory damages, disgorgement of profits and in some cases penalties. on 8 august 2008, ubs entered into settlements in principle with the sec, the new york attorney general (nyag) and other state agencies represented by the north american securities administrators association (nasaa), whereby ubs agreed to offer to buy back arss from eligible customers within certain time periods, the last of which begins on 30 june 2010, and to pay penalties of usd 150 million (usd 75 million to the nyag, usd 75 million to the other states). ubs subsequently finalized its settlement with the state of massachusetts, the sec and the nyag, and is continuing to finalize agreements with the other state regulators. ubs&#146;s settlement is largely in line with similar industry regulatory settlements. the nyag and sec continue to investigate individuals affiliated with ubs who traded in arss or who had responsibility for disclosures. page 3 of 11 pages cusip no. 92839u107 us cross-border: ubs ag has been responding to a number of governmental inquiries and investigations relating to its cross-border private banking services to us private clients during the years 2000-2007. on 18 february 2009, ubs announced that it had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (dpa) with the us department of justice tax division (doj) and the united states attorney&#146;s office for the southern district of florida, and a consent order with the sec relating to these investigations. as part of these settlement agreements, among other things: (i) ubs will pay a total of usd 780 million to the united states, usd 380 million representing disgorgement of profits from maintaining the us cross-border business and usd 400 million representing us federal backup withholding tax required to be withheld by ubs, together with interest and penalties, and restitution for unpaid taxes associated with certain account relationships involving fraudulent sham and nominee offshore structures and otherwise as covered by the dpa; (ii) ubs will complete the exit of the us cross-border business out of non-sec registered entities, as announced in july 2008, which these settlements permit ubs to do in a lawful, orderly and expeditious manner; (iii) ubs will implement and maintain an effective program of internal controls with respect to compliance with its obligations under its qualified intermediary (qi) agreement with the internal revenue service (irs), as well as a revised legal and compliance governance structure in order to strengthen independent legal and compliance controls; and (iv) pursuant to an order issued by the swiss financial market supervisory authority (finma), information was transferred to the doj regarding accounts of certain us clients as set forth in the dpa who, based on evidence available to ubs, appear to have committed tax fraud or the like within the meaning of the swiss-us double taxation treaty. pursuant to the dpa, the doj has agreed that any further prosecution of ubs will be deferred for a period of at least 18 months, subject to extension under certain circumstances such as ubs needing more time to complete the implementation of the exit of its us cross-border business. if ubs satisfies all of its obligations under the dpa, the doj will refrain permanently from pursuing charges against ubs relating to the investigation of its us cross-border business. as part of the sec resolution, the sec filed a complaint against ubs in us federal district court in washington, d.c., charging ubs with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and investment advisor in connection with maintaining its us cross-border business. pursuant to the consent order, ubs did not admit or deny the allegations in that complaint, and consented to the entry of a final judgment that provides, among other things, that: (i) ubs will pay usd 200 million to the sec, representing disgorgement of profits from the us cross-border business (this amount is included in, and not in addition to, the usd 780 million ubs is paying to the united states as described above); and (ii) ubs will complete its exit of the us cross-border business and will be permanently enjoined from violating the sec registration requirements by providing broker-dealer or investment advisory services to us persons through ubs entities not registered with the sec. the district court entered the final judgment on 19 march 2009.
