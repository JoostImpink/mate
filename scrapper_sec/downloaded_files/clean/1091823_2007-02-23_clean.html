cusip no. 648468 20 5 &#160; page&#160;7 of&#160; 9 consummation of the&#160;offer&#160;is subject to certain conditions, including,&#160;approval of the&#160;acquisition and an amendment to parent's articles of association&#160;by parent's shareholders, the tender of a majority of the shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis, the expiration or earlier termination of the hart-scott-rodino waiting period, and other customary conditions. upon consummation of the merger, the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the surviving corporation in the merger will be amended and restated as fully set forth in the merger agreement. following the consummation of the merger, the company&#8217;s capital stock will be deregistered under the exchange act of 1934, as amended and delisted from the nasdaq global market. pursuant to the tender agreement, each signing shareholder has agreed to validly tender or cause to be tendered in the offer all shares of common stock beneficially owned by such signing shareholder pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the offer no later than 17 business days after commencement of the offer. in addition, pursuant to the tender agreement, each signing shareholder has agreed that during the period beginning on the date of the tender agreement and ending on the earlier of (a) the consummation of the merger, (b) the termination of the tender agreement by mutual agreement, and (c) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms (the &#8220;agreement period&#8221;), each signing shareholder shall at any meeting of the company&#8217;s shareholders vote its shares of common stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. the tender agreement will automatically terminate at the end of the agreement period. the shares of common stock currently owned by such signing shareholders represent in the aggregate a majority of the currently outstanding shares of common stock. a copy of the merger agreement is attached as exhibit 1 to this statement and is incorporated herein by reference. a copy of the tender agreement is attached as exhibit 2 to this statement and is incorporated herein by reference. the foregoing description of the merger agreement and the tender agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement and the tender agreement, as applicable. &#160;
