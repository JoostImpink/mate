common stock issued as dividends on or in any combination or subdivision of the foregoing. when the phrase "conversion stock" is used herein, it shall refer to the sum of shares of common stock issued as a result of the conversion of, plus shares of common stock issuable on conversion of, the series b preferred stock, unless otherwise specified. conversion stock shall exclude any shares otherwise included in the foregoing from and after the date that such shares are sold pursuant to a registered public offering. 1.5 "demand stock" is defined in section 2.1a. 1.6 "exchange act" shall refer to the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. 1.7 "holders of registrable securities" (including references to holders of certain percentages of registrable securities) collectively refers to the holders of series b preferred stock (to the extent that such shares of stock have not then been converted into common stock) and the holders of shares of common stock that theretofore have been issued upon the conversion of series b preferred stock (based upon conversion of the series b preferred stock). 1.8 "initiating holders" means holder(s) of registrable securities who in the aggregate hold

such request to all holders of registrable securities (such holders of registrable securities being referred to as the "notified persons"), who then shall have 30 days to indicate in writing if they desire to be included in such registration. if the initiating holders intend to distribute the demand stock by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise rio grande as part of their written request. "demand stock" shall mean all of the shares of registrable securities being requested to be registered by the initiating holders and the notified persons. rio grande will use its best efforts to expeditiously (but in any event within 90 days of the written request described in the first sentence of this section) effect the registration of the demand stock under the securities act and qualify the demand stock for sale under any state blue sky law, but only to the extent provided for in the following provisions of this article ii; provided, however, that the shares of demand stock for which registration has been requested shall constitute at least 40% of the total shares of registrable securities then outstanding (assuming for this purpose that all issued and outstanding series b preferred stock is converted into conversion stock). rio grande shall not be required to effect registration pursuant to requests under this section 2.1 more than three (3) times for the holders of the registrable securities as a group. a demand registration instituted pursuant to this section 2.1 shall not be counted as such unless and until (1) rio grande shall have in good faith filed a registration statement with the commission pursuant to this section 2.1 and (2) the holders holding at least a majority of the registrable securities included in such offering elect to proceed with the registration process after receiving the commission's complete initial comments, if any, to the first filing of such registration statement. rio grande shall not be required to include in such registration any shares of common stock that are issuable upon the conversion of preferred stock unless the holder commits in writing to rio grande that such holder will convert the preferred stock into shares of common stock before or not later than simultaneously with the effectiveness of the registration statement registering those shares of common stock. b. whenever a demand registration pursuant to section 2.1a is made, rio grande shall be entitled to include in any registration statement (i) shares of common stock to be sold by other holders of common stock with registration rights that allow such holders to participate in the registration (the "other registration rights holders"), and (ii) shares of common stock to be sold by rio grande for its own account; provided, however that if the managing underwriter determines in good faith that the number of shares of common stock to be sold in such registration should be limited due to market conditions, then the number of shares of common stock included by rio grande in such registration shall be reduced to the extent necessary to cause the total number of shares of common stock being so registered to be reduced to the number determined by the underwriter, and if such reduction is not sufficient, then after the number of shares of common stock included by rio grande has been decreased to zero, then the number of shares of common stock included by the other registration rights holders shall be reduced pro rata among the other registration rights holders to the extent necessary to cause the total number of shares of common stock being so registered to be further reduced to the number determined by the underwriter, and if such further reduction is not sufficient, then after the number of shares of common stock included by the other registration rights holders is reduced to zero, then the demand stock shall be reduced pro_rata to the extent necessary to cause the number of shares of demand stock so registered to equal the number determined by the underwriter. except as permitted herein, rio grande may not cause any other registration of securities for sale for its own account or for persons other than a holder of registrable securities (other than a registration effected solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a transaction to which rule 145 of the commission is applicable, or as may be required pursuant to the terms of those certain warrant agreements, as amended through the date hereof, issued by the company in connection with the company's 1995 11.50% subordinated notes) to become effective less than 180 days after the effective date of any registration required pursuant to this section 2.1. c. if at the time of any request to register demand stock pursuant to this section 2.1, rio grande is preparing a registration statement for a registered public offering which in fact is filed and becomes effective within 90 days after the request, then rio grande may at its option direct that such request to register demand stock be delayed for a period not in excess of six months from the effective date of such offering. such right to delay a request shall be exercised by rio grande not more than once in any two year period. nothing in this section 2.1c shall preclude a holder of registrable securities from enjoying registration rights pursuant to the terms of section 2.2 hereof. no demand shall be made by holders of registrable securities at any time, within six (6) months of the effective date of any other registration of common stock in which holders of registrable securities were entitled to participate pursuant to the terms of this agreement. rio grande may postpone for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 90 days) the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to this section 2.1 if, at the time it receives a request for registration: (x) the board of directors of rio grande shall determine in good faith that such offering will interfere materially with a pending or contemplated financing, merger, sale of assets, recapitalization or other similar corporate action of rio grande and rio grande shall have furnished to the persons seeking such registration a certificate signed by the president of rio grande to that effect, accompanied by a certified copy of the relevant board resolutions; or (y) the board of directors of rio grande shall determine in good faith that the disclosures required in connection with such registration could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the business or prospects of rio grande and rio grande shall have furnished to the persons seeking such registration a certificate signed by the president of rio grande to that effect, accompanied by a certified copy of the relevant board resolutions. 2.2 piggyback registration. if rio grande at any time proposes a registered public offering, it will, as soon as practicable but no less than 30 days prior to filing the registration statement, give written notice to all holders of registrable securities of its intention to do so (stating the intended method of disposition of such securities). upon the written request of any holders of registrable securities given within 20 days after transmittal by rio grande to the holders of such notice, rio grande will, subject to the limits contained in this section 2.2, use its best efforts to cause those registrable securities of said requesting holders to be included in such registration statement; provided, however that if the underwriter managing such registration determines in good faith that market or economic conditions limit the amount of securities which may reasonably be expected to be sold, rio grande may limit the number of shares of common stock included by persons other than rio grande, including, without limitation, the registrable securities (the "piggyback stock") to be included in such registration and the holders of the piggyback stock will be allowed to register their piggyback stock pro rata based on the number of shares of piggyback stock held by such holders, respectively. if any holder of piggyback stock disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, he may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to rio grande and the managing underwriter. if, by the withdrawal of such piggyback stock, a greater number of piggyback stock held by other holders of piggyback stock may be included in such registration (up to the limit imposed by the underwriters), rio grande shall offer to all holders of piggyback stock who have included piggyback stock in the registration the right to include additional piggyback stock, pro rata. any piggyback stock excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration. rio grande shall be under no obligation to complete any offering of its securities it proposes to make and shall incur no liability to any holder of registrable securities for its failure to do so. 2.3 registration procedures. if and whenever rio grande is required by the provisions of this article ii to use its best efforts to effect the registration of registrable securities under the securities act, rio grande will, as expeditiously as possible: (i) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the period provided in this article ii; (ii) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the sale or other disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement whenever the seller or sellers of such securities shall desire to sell or otherwise dispose of the same, but only to the extent provided in this article ii; (iii) furnish to each seller such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents, as such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the securities owned by such seller; (iv) use its best efforts to register or qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or state blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as each seller, or in the case of an underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and things which may be necessary under such securities or blue sky laws to enable the public sale or other disposition of the securities in such jurisdictions, except that rio grande shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified; (v) before filing the registration statement or prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto, furnish to one special counsel selected by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities included in such offering copies of such documents proposed to be filed which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of such special counsel; (vi) if the offering is underwritten, at the request of any seller, use its best efforts to furnish on the date securities are delivered to the underwriter for sale pursuant to such registration (a) an opinion of counsel for rio grande, dated the effective date of the registration statement, addressed to the seller and to rio grande, and (b) a "comfort" letter signed by the independent public accountants who have certified rio grande's financial statements included in the registration statement, addressed to the seller and the underwriter, covering substantially the same matters with respect to the registration statement (and the prospectus included therein) and (in the case of the accountants' letter) with respect to events subsequent to the date of the financial statements, as are customarily covered (at the time of such registration) in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities; (vii) cause all registrable securities covered by such registration to be listed on each securities exchange, including the nasdaq stock market, on which similar securities issued by rio grande are then listed; and (viii) take such other actions as shall be reasonably requested by a holder of registrable securities included in such registration. provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of this article ii, rio grande shall not in any event be required to use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration statement for a period in excess of 90 days or 120 days in the case of registrations pursuant to section 2.1 (or at the request of the selling holders, an additional 90 days or 120 days as the case may be). the term "seller" as used in this article ii refers to a holder of the registrable securities selling such shares. in connection with each registration hereunder, each seller shall furnish to rio grande in writing such information with respect to such seller as reasonably shall be necessary in order to assure compliance with federal and applicable state securities laws. 2.4 expenses. all expenses incurred in effecting the registration provided for in sections 2.1, 2.2 and section 2.9, including without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel for rio grande and fees of one special counsel for all of the selling holders of the registrable securities being so registered selected by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities included in the registration, underwriting expenses (other than fees, commissions or discounts relating to the sale of shares of common stock, other than for the account of rio grande, that are included in the registration), expenses of any audits incident to or required by any such registration, expenses of complying with the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdictions pursuant to section 2.3(iv) hereof, and any other expenses incurred in taking the actions described in section 2.3 (all of such expenses referred to as "registration expenses"), shall be paid by rio grande; provided, however that in the case of a registration pursuant to section 2.1, participating sellers of registrable securities shall bear their respective pro rata portion of expenses incurred by rio grande for its accountants to audit other than year-end financial statements, unless in the case of a registration pursuant to section 2.1 in which more than 40% of the common stock included in such registration is common stock for the account of rio grande, in which case rio grande shall pay its proportionate share of such additional audit expense. 2.5 indemnification. a. in the event of any registration of any of its securities under the securities act pursuant to this article ii, rio grande shall indemnify and hold harmless the seller of such securities, each underwriter (as defined in the securities act), and each other person who participates in the offering of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of the securities act) such seller, underwriter or participating person (individually and collectively the "indemnified person") against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively the "liability"),to which such indemnified person may become subject insofar as such liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any violation by rio grande of any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act or any state securities law applicable to and relating to action or inaction required of rio grande in connection with any such registration. rio grande shall reimburse each such indemnified person for all fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) reasonably incurred by such indemnified person in connection with investigating or, subject to paragraph d of this section 2.5, defending or settling any such liability; provided, however, that rio grande shall not be liable to any indemnified person in any such case to the extent that any such liability arises out of or is based upon any alleged untrue statements or alleged omissions made in such registration statement, preliminary or final prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to rio grande by such indemnified person specifically for use therein. b. each holder of any securities sold pursuant to any registration under this article ii shall, by acceptance of the proceeds thereof, indemnify and hold harmless, for the sale of its securities in such registration, each other holder of any such securities, rio grande, its directors and officers, its legal counsel and independent public accountants, each underwriter and each other person, if any, who controls rio grande or such underwriter (individually and collectively the "rio grande indemnified person"), against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, to which any such rio grande indemnified person may become subject insofar as such liability (or actions in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which securities were registered under the securities act at the written request of such holder, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of (i) and (ii) to the extent, but only to the extent, that such alleged untrue statement or alleged omission was made in such registration statement, preliminary or final prospectus, amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to rio grande by such holder specifically for use therein, and then only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statements or omission or alleged omissions by the holder were not based on the authority of an expert as to which the holder had no reasonable ground to believe, and did not believe, that the statements made on the authority of such expert were untrue or that there was an omission to state a material fact. such holder shall reimburse any rio grande indemnified person for any reasonable legal fees reasonably incurred in investigating or, subject to paragraph d of this section 2.5, defending any such liability. c. indemnification similar to that specified in section 2.5a and section 2.5b shall be given by rio grande and each holder of any securities sold pursuant to a registration under this article ii (with such modifications as may be appropriate) with respect to any required registration or other qualification of such securities under any federal or state law or regulation of a governmental authority other than the securities act. d. in the event rio grande, any holder of registrable securities or of securities sold pursuant to this agreement or any other person receives a complaint, claim or other notice of any liability or action, giving rise to a claim for indemnification under paragraphs a, b or c of this section 2.5, the person claiming indemnification under such paragraphs shall promptly notify the person against whom indemnification is sought of such complaint, notice, claim or action, and such indemnifying person shall have the right to investigate and defend any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided however, that failure to so notify shall not affect the indemnification rights under paragraphs a, b or c of this section 2.5 except to the extent (but only to the extent) the indemnifying person was materially adversely prejudiced by such failure. the person claiming indemnification shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the person against whom indemnification is sought (unless the indemnifying party fails to defend the persons rightfully claiming indemnification under this section 2.5, in which case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the person against whom indemnification is sought). in no event shall a person against whom indemnification is sought be obligated to indemnify any person for any settlement of any claim or action effected without the indemnifying person's prior written consent. e. if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.5 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relevant fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount any holder of registrable securities shall be obligated to contribute pursuant to this section 2.5e shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds received by such holder pursuant to the registration statement which gives rise to such obligation to contribute (less the aggregate amount of any damages which the holder has otherwise been required to pay in respect of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action or any substantially similar loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of such securities). f. the indemnification provided by this section 2.5 shall be a continuing right to indemnification and shall survive the registration and sale of any securities by any person entitled to indemnification hereunder and the expiration or termination of this agreement. 2.6 termination of registration rights. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this article ii, the rights to registration and the designation of conversion stock as registrable securities shall terminate as to any particular securities when such securities shall have been transferred or assigned in any manner except as set forth in section 2.10 hereto. 2.7 compliance with rule 144 and rule 144a. rio grande shall make available to each holder of registrable securities the benefit of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may permit such holder to sell conversion stock to the public without registration under the securities act by (a) making and keeping "current public information" "available" (as both such terms are defined in rule 144 under the securities act) at all times, (b) use its best efforts to timely file with the commission, in accordance with all rules and regulations applicable thereto, all reports and other documents (i) required of rio grande for rule 144, as it may be amended from time to time (or any rule, regulation or statute replacing rule 144), to be available to stockholders of rio grande and (ii) required to be filed under section 15(d) of the exchange act, notwithstanding that rio grande's duty to file such reports or documents may be suspended or otherwise terminated under the express terms of such provision and (c) upon request by such holder, furnishing such holder a written statement by rio grande that it has complied with the reporting requirements of the exchange act and rule 144, together with a copy of the most recent annual or

_________________________ its: ex-4 4 exhibit 4 stockholders agreement this stockholders agreement (this "agreement") is made this 16th day of january, 1997, by and among robert a. buschman and guy bob buschman, in their capacities as stockholders, (the "founders"), rio grande, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), and the persons and organizations whose signatures appear below (whether one or more, the "stockholders"). whereas, pursuant to that certain preferred stock purchase agreement dated as of january 16, 1997, the stockholders acquired from the company shares of its series a preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "series a preferred stock") and shares of its series b preferred stock, par value $.01 per share ("series b preferred stock") which are convertible into shares of common stock of the company, par value $.01 per share, as more fully set forth in the certificate of designation filed with the secretary of state of delaware on january 15, 1997 (such common stock, adjusted, hereinafter referred to as, the "common stock"); and whereas, the founders are presently the legal or beneficial owner of 2,360,940 shares, collectively, of the outstanding common stock of the company; and whereas, the founders have agreed pursuant to this agreement, among other things, to grant the stockholders the opportunity to participate, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement, in certain subsequent sales of the common stock of the company made by the founders to induce the stockholders to make the proposed investment; now, therefore, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: article 1 sales by a founder 1.1 notice of certain purchase offers. prior to january 18, 2002 (unless otherwise terminated pursuant to section 5.1 hereof), except as set forth in section 1.5, should either founder propose to accept one or more bona fide offers (collectively the "purchase offer") from any persons to purchase shares of the company's common stock from the founder (a "transferring founder"), then such transferring founder shall promptly notify each stockholder of the terms and conditions of such purchase offer. for purposes hereof, a "person" means a natural person, partnership, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, joint venture, unincorporated organization or other entity, or a governmental entity or any department, agency or political subdivision thereof. 1.2 right to participate. each stockholder shall have the right, exercisable upon written notice to the transferring founder within 15 business days after the date of receipt of the notice of the purchase offer, to participate in the transferring founder's sale of common stock on the same terms and conditions. a "business day" means any day other than saturday, sunday or a day on which national banks located in the state of kansas are authorized to be closed for business. if no stockholder elects to participate in the purchase offer as provided herein, then the transferring founder may offer such common stock to any outsider pursuant to the terms of the purchase offer. to the extent a stockholder exercises such right of participation, the number of shares of common stock which the transferring founder may sell pursuant to such purchase offer shall be correspondingly reduced in accordance with the provisions below. the right of participation of each stockholder shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) each stockholder may sell all or any part of that number of shares of common stock of the company which it then owns equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock covered by the purchase offer by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock of the company at the time owned by such stockholder and the denominator of which is the combined number of shares of common stock of the company at the time owned by the transferring founder (including shares transferred to permitted transferees as hereinafter defined in accordance herewith) and the stockholders. for purposes of making such computation, each stockholder shall be deemed to own the number of shares of common stock into which all its series b preferred stock is convertible on the date such stockholder receives the notice of the purchase offer. (b) each stockholder may participate in the sale by delivering to the transferring founder for transfer to the purchase offeror one or more certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, which represent the number of shares of common stock which such stockholder elects to sell pursuant to this section 1.2 not to exceed the number of shares of common stock which it may sell as determined in accordance with section 1.2(a) above; or that number of shares of series b preferred stock which is at such time convertible into the number of shares of common stock which such stockholder elects to sell pursuant to this section 1.2 not to exceed the number of shares of common stock which it may sell as determined in accordance with section 1.2(a) above; provided, however, that if the purchase offeror objects to the delivery of series b preferred stock in lieu of common stock, such stockholder may convert and deliver common stock as provided in subparagraph (b)(i) above. (c) if a stockholder elects not to participate in such a sale and the terms and conditions of such sale thereafter materially change (except with regard to the purchase price, as to which any change shall be deemed material), the founders must once again give the notice required in section 1.1 and allow each such stockholder the opportunity to participate in such sale. 1.3 consummation of sale. the stock certificate or certificates which the stockholder delivers to the transferring founder pursuant to section 1.2 shall be transferred by the transferring founder to the purchase offeror in consummation of the sale of the common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the section 1.1 notice to the stockholders, and the transferring founder shall promptly thereafter remit to such stockholder that portion of the sale proceeds to which such stockholder is entitled by reason of its participation in such sale. 1.4 ongoing rights. the exercise or non-exercise of the rights of the stockholders hereunder to participate in one or more sales of common stock made by the founders shall not adversely affect their rights to participate in subsequent sales of common stock by either founder pursuant to section 1.1 hereof. 1.5 permitted transfers. the participation rights of the stockholders and restriction on transfers by the founders shall not apply (a) to offers or sales by the founders or their permitted transferees in an underwritten public offering or otherwise pursuant to an effective registration statement, on the facilities of a national securities exchange or in any other recognized public securities market, (b) to any pledge of common stock made by a founder pursuant to a bona fide loan transaction which creates a mere security interest, (c) upon the death of a founder, to any transfer of common stock owned by such founder on the date of such founder's death to such founder's ancestors or descendants or spouse or to a trustee for their benefit or to any charity, (d) to any inter vivos gift of shares to such founder's ancestors or descendants or spouse or to a trust for the benefit of any of the foregoing, or (ed) to any other bona fide gift (collectively, "permitted transfers" and the respective transferees "permitted transferee"); provided, however, that (i) such founder shall inform the stockholders of any permitted transfer involving singly or in the aggregate more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis and (ii) to the extent any person (other than an underwriter in connection with a registered offering) acquires beneficial ownership of common stock representing more than 5% of the then outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis as a result of a permitted transfer, the transferring founder will request such person to furnish the stockholders with a written agreement to be bound by and comply with all provisions of this agreement applicable to such founder; provided, to the extent a founder makes a permitted transfer and subsequently re-acquires shares from such permitted transferee, those shares shall again become subject to the terms hereof. 1.6 restrictions on transfer on or before january 18, 2000. without the prior written consent of the stockholders, except as otherwise expressly permitted by sections 1.5(a) - (c)sections 1.5(a)-(d), neither founder will sell, assign or otherwise transfer any shares of common stock owned by such founder on or before january 18, 2000;

(a) mandatory redemption. if, on or before january 16, 2002, the company completes successfully a registered public offering, the company shall redeem (unless otherwise prevented by law) all (but not less than all) outstanding shares of series a preferred stock (a "mandatory redemption") at an amount per share equal to the face value plus accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares, if any, accrued to the date of redemption (the "mandatory redemption price"). as used herein, "registered public offering" shall refer to a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended, other than a registration effected in connection with an employee benefit plan or a transaction of a type specified in rule 145 under such act (or any successor thereto). the redemption shall occur on the same day on which the registered public offering is consummated (the "mandatory redemption date"). not more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the mandatory redemption date, the company shall send notice of the mandatory redemption by first-class certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the company. the notice shall refer to this section a.4(a) and shall specify the mandatory redemption date and the time and place of the mandatory redemption. before, on or after the mandatory redemption date, each holder of series a preferred stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the company the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the mandatory redemption notice, and thereupon the mandatory redemption price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. notwithstanding delivery of a mandatory redemption notice in accordance with this section a.4(a), any such notice shall be deemed conditional and expressly subject to consummation of the registered public offering referred to hereinabove, and if said registered public offering shall not be consummated, any such mandatory redemption notice shall be deemed void ab initio and of no force and effect. (b) redemption at option of majority of holders. if the company does not successfully complete a registered public offering (as described in section a.4(a)) on or before january 16, 2002, then at any time after january 16, 2002 but only at any time during the first 10 days after each dividend payment date (the "redemption election period") the holders of a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of series a preferred stock (the "majority holders") may elect to require the company to redeem shares of series a preferred stock at an amount equal to the face value plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the respective dates of redemption of the shares (the "optional redemption price") in accordance with this section a.4(b). the majority holders may require the company to redeem with respect to each redemption election period up to that number of shares of series a preferred stock equal to 10% of the aggregate number of shares of series a preferred stock that the company has issued (whether or not then issued or outstanding, including shares of series a preferred stock that were issued and subsequently redeemed or otherwise cancelled) as of the beginning of such redemption election period. if the majority holders elect to cause such a redemption, they shall so notify the company in writing (the "redemption exercise notice"). upon receipt of the redemption exercise notice the company shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days of receipt of the redemption exercise notice) notify all holders of series a preferred stock of such election by sending a notice (the "optional redemption notice") by first class certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to the holders of series a preferred stock at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the company. the optional redemption notice shall refer to this section a.4(b) and shall specify the last day of the month following the month during which the company received the redemption exercise notice as the date on which shares of series a preferred stock will be redeemed in accordance with this section a.4(b) (the "optional redemption date"). the company shall promptly notify (the "section a.4(b) redemption notice") each holder of series a preferred stock of the number of shares of series a preferred stock held by such holder which are being redeemed pursuant to this section on any optional redemption date. an election by the majority holders in accordance with this section a.4(b) shall be binding upon all holders of the series a preferred stock, and shares of series a preferred stock shall be redeemed pro rata among all holders of said shares to give effect to the provisions of this section a.4(b). upon receipt of the section a.4(b) redemption notice, and before, on or after the optional redemption date, each holder of series a preferred stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the company the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the section a.4(b) redemption notice, and thereupon the optional redemption price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificates shall be cancelled. the company shall promptly reissue to such holders (or their nominees) certificates evidencing any shares of series a preferred stock represented by the surrendered certificates which are not redeemed. (c) redemption at the option of the company. the company may at any time after january 16, 2003 redeem all of the then issued and outstanding shares of series a preferred stock as set forth in this section a.4(c) if all accrued dividends have been declared and paid to the holders of record of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock through the most recent dividend payment date. the date of such redemption (the "company redemption date") shall be designated in the notice described in the succeeding paragraph and must be a date within ten (10) business days after a dividend payment date. the redemption price for any redemption pursuant to this section a.4(c) (the "company redemption price") shall be the face value of all of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock plus an additional amount equal to 10% of the face value of such outstanding shares of series a preferred stock. not more than sixty (60) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the company redemption date, the company shall send notice of the redemption by first-class, certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to all of the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the company. the notice shall refer to this section a.4(c) and shall specify the company redemption date and the time and place of the redemption. before, on or after the company redemption date, each holder of series a preferred stock shall surrender to the company the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the company redemption notice, and thereupon the company redemption price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. (d) provision for payment. "redemption date" shall refer to the mandatory redemption date (in the case of redemptions governed by section a.4(a)), an optional redemption date (in the case of redemptions governed by section a.4(b)), and a company redemption date (in the case of redemptions governed by section a.4(c). "redemption price" shall mean the amount to be paid by the company on a particular redemption date pursuant to section a.4(a) (as the mandatory redemption price), section a.4(b) (as the optional redemption price), or section a.4(c) (as the company redemption price) as applicable. on or prior to each redemption date, the company shall deposit the redemption price of all shares of series a preferred stock designated for redemption on that redemption date with a bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to pay the redemption price for such shares to their respective holders on or after the related redemption date upon receipt of notification from the company that such holder has surrendered his share certificate to the company pursuant to section a.4(a), section a.4(b) or section a.4(c) above. as of the redemption date, the deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares being redeemed on that redemption date, and from and after the redemption date the shares so called for redemption on that redemption date shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust corporation payment of the redemption price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor. the balance of any moneys deposited by the company pursuant to this section a.4(d) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of three (3) years following the redemption date shall thereafter be returned to the company upon its request expressed in a resolution of its board of directors. (e) rights upon redemption. from and after the redemption date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the redemption price, all rights of the holders of shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed on that redemption date as holders of series a preferred stock (except the right to receive the redemption price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the company or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. if the funds of the company legally available for redemption of shares of series a preferred stock on any redemption date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of series a preferred stock. at any time thereafter when additional funds of the company in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) are legally available for the redemption of shares of series a preferred stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares which the company has become obligated to redeem on any redemption date, but which it has not redeemed. the shares of series a preferred stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. (f) cancellation of redeemed stock. any shares of series a preferred stock redeemed pursuant to this section shall be cancelled and shall not under any circumstances be reissued; and the company may from time to time take such appropriate corporate action as may be necessary to reduce accordingly the number of authorized shares of the company's capital stock. (g) acquisition by company. the company will not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the company to, purchase or acquire any shares of series a preferred stock otherwise than pursuant to (a) the terms of this section a.4 or (b) an offer made on the same terms to all holders of series a preferred stock at the time outstanding. 5. no sinking fund. there shall be no sinking fund for the payment of dividends, or liquidation preferences on the series a preferred stock or the redemption of any shares thereof. b. series b preferred stock there is hereby established a series b preferred stock, consisting of 500,000 shares, having a face value of $10.00 per share (the "face value") and having the rights, preferences, powers, restrictions and limitations set forth in this article b. except as set forth herein, for all purposes in this article b pertaining to the series b preferred stock, the term "junior stock" shall include series c preferred stock, common stock and other capital stock of the company not expressly designated to be on parity with or senior to the series b preferred stock; provided, however, that series c preferred stock shall not be junior to the series b preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends as set forth in section c.1 and section b.1, respectively, and dividends on the series c preferred stock shall be payable in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on the series b preferred stock. 1. dividends. the holders of the series b preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative dividends at the rate of .035 shares of series c preferred stock (subject to appropriate adjustments in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) per fiscal quarter of the company per share of series b preferred stock. on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the company does not have a sufficient number of shares of series c preferred stock available for issue as dividends hereunder or (ii) the date on which any shares of series b preferred stock are redeemed pursuant to section b.4 below, then in lieu of the dividend described in the first sentence of this section b.1, the holders of the series b preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative cash dividends compounded annually at the rate of 14% of the face value of the series b preferred stock per share per annum (subject to appropriate adjustments in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares). all dividends on series b preferred stock shall be payable in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on junior stock, but payable after any payment of any dividend on series a preferred stock and series c preferred stock, and payable on the first day of february, may, august and november of each year ("dividend payment date"), when and as declared by the board of directors of the company; provided that the first dividend payment date shall be may 1, 1997 and shall include dividends beginning february 1, 1997. such dividends shall accrue with respect to each share of series b preferred stock beginning on february 1, 1997 and thereafter shall be deemed to accrue from day to day whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there exists profits, surplus or other funds legally available for the payment of dividends, and shall be cumulative so that if such dividends on the series b preferred stock shall not have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment, the deficiency shall be fully paid or declared and set apart for payment before any dividend shall be paid or declared or set apart for any junior stock and before any purchase or acquisition of any junior stock is made by the company. at the earlier of: (i) prior to the redemption of the series b preferred stock; (ii) three (3) days prior to the consummation of an underwritten registered public offering of the type described in section b.4(a); or (iii) the liquidation of the company, the sale of the company or, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of its assets, or the merger, consolidation or other combination of the company with another entity in a transaction in which the company is not the surviving entity, any accrued but undeclared dividends shall be paid to the holders of record of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock. no accumulation of dividends on the series b preferred stock shall bear interest. within ten (10) days after each dividend payment date, holders of series b preferred stock will receive written notification from the company or the transfer agent specifying the number of shares of series c preferred stock paid as a dividend and the recipient's aggregate holdings of series c preferred stock as of that dividend payment date and after giving effect to the dividend. certificates evidencing the shares of series c preferred stock issued as dividends on the series b preferred stock shall be mailed promptly by the company to the holders of record of the series b preferred stock as their names and addresses appear on the share register of the company or at the office of the transfer agent on the corresponding dividend payment date. 2. liquidation, dissolution or winding up. (a) in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, the holders of shares of series b preferred stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the company available for distribution to its stockholders, after and subject to the payment in full of all amounts required to be distributed to the holders of series a preferred stock of the company, but before any payment shall be made to the holders of junior stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal to $10 per share of series b preferred stock plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the payment date (whether or not declared) (the "liquidation value"). if upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company the remaining assets of the company available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of series b preferred stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled, the holders of shares of series b preferred stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the remaining assets and funds of the company in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full. (b) unless the holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock then outstanding otherwise consent in writing or by vote, the merger, consolidation or other combination of the company into or with another corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity which results in the exchange of more than 50% of the voting securities of the company for securities or other consideration issued or paid or caused to be issued or paid by such other corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity or an affiliate thereof, or the sale, directly or indirectly, of all or substantially all the assets of the company, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company for purposes of this section, and shall entitle the holders of series b preferred stock to receive at the closing in cash, securities or other property the amounts as specified in section b.2(a) above. the value of such property, rights or other securities shall be determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company. 3. voting. (a) general right. in addition to the other voting rights provided by this section b or provided by applicable law, each holder of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to vote the weighted number of votes (as defined below) related to the number of shares of series b preferred stock held by such holder at each meeting of stockholders of the company (and written actions of stockholders in lieu of meetings) with respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the company for their action or consideration. "weighted number of votes" as to one share of series b preferred stock means as of any particular date the quotient of the targeted voting power as of such date divided by the number of shares of series b preferred stock issued and outstanding as of such date. for so long as 500,000 shares of series b preferred stock are issued and outstanding, the "targeted voting power" shall mean, as of a particular date on which the vote of stockholders is taken, that number of votes necessary to result in all of the holders of the then issued and outstanding shares of series b preferred stock holding collectively 24% of the votes eligible for casting on that date and the holders of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock holding, collectively, 76% of the votes eligible for casting on that date. notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the company shall be in arrears in whole or in part with regard to quarterly dividends as specified in section b.1 for three (3) consecutive dividend payment dates, the holders of a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of series b preferred stock may notify the company of their election to exercise their rights under this sentence and, upon the company's receipt of such notice and unless and until the company distributes in full to the holders of series b preferred stock all dividends which are in arrears, the "24%" percentage contained in the definition of "targeted voting power" shall be deemed to be "51%", subject to adjustment as set forth below. if at any time less than 500,000 shares of series b preferred stock are issued and outstanding, then the percentages specified above in the definition of "targeted voting power" (i.e., 24% or 51%, as the case may be) shall be reduced by multiplying said targeted voting power by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of series b preferred stock which are then issued and outstanding and the denominator of which shall be 500,000. except as provided by law, by the provisions of subsection b.3(b), b.3(c) or b.3(d) or by the provisions establishing any other series of preferred stock, holders of series b preferred stock shall vote together with the holders of common stock as a single class. (b) no impairment. the company shall not amend, alter or repeal preferences, rights, powers or other terms of the series b preferred stock, whether in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the company or otherwise, so as to affect adversely the series b preferred stock, or amend, alter or repeal this section b.3, without the prior written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred stock, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may be) separately as a class. for this purpose, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the authorization or issuance of any series of preferred stock or other capital stock which is on a parity with or has preference or priority over the series b preferred stock as to the right to receive either dividends or amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company shall be deemed to affect adversely the series b preferred stock. (c) voting on other certain events. without the prior written consent or affirmative vote of the holder(s) of a majority of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred stock, voting as a single class, in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or at a special or annual meeting of shareholders called for the purpose, the company shall not, and it will cause its subsidiaries not to: (i) authorize or issue shares of any class of stock (other than the series a and series c preferred stock authorized hereby) having any preference or priority as to dividends or assets superior to or on a parity with any such preference or priority of the series b preferred stock; (ii) permit the number of directors constituting the board of directors of the company to be less than six or more than nine; (iii) reclassify any shares of any class of stock into shares having any preference or priority as to dividends or assets superior to or on a parity with any such preference or priority of the series b preferred stock; (iv) engage in any business other than acquiring, producing, selling and developing oil and gas properties and exploring for, producing, transporting, marketing and selling oil, natural gas and related hydrocarbons; (v) repurchase or agree to repurchase more than 12,500 shares of its common stock or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of its common stock; provided, however, this provision shall not be interpreted as limiting the redemption rights of the company or the holders of the series a preferred stock, series b preferred stock, or series c preferred stock as set forth in this certificate of designation, or as limiting the ability of the company with board approval to repurchase up to 75,000 shares of common stock (or rights to acquire common stock) from employees other than robert a. buschman, guy bob buschman, or gary scheele); (vi) without limiting any other right of the holders of series b preferred stock, pay cash dividends or make any other distribution on any shares of common stock at any time prior to january 16, 1999; (vii) enter into, or permit a subsidiary to enter into, any new agreement or make any amendment to any existing agreement, which by its terms would restrict the company's performance of its obligations to holders of series b preferred stock; or (viii) reduce the percentage of shares of series b preferred stock required to consent to any of the above matters, or alter or negate the need for such consent. (d) board of directors. (i) for so long as there are more than 200,000 shares of series b preferred stock issued and outstanding, the holders of the series b preferred stock shall have the right at each stockholder meeting for the election of directors and from time to time, voting as a class separate and apart from the common stock, to nominate and elect to the company's board of directors ("board"), that number of individuals (the "series b nominees") who, immediately after giving effect to their election and at all times thereafter, represent not less than one-third of the number of members constituting the board; provided, however, that if there are less than 200,000 shares of series b preferred stock issued and outstanding, the holders of the series b preferred stock shall have the right to elect one member of the board of directors; and provided further that a majority of the holders of series b preferred stock may waive the foregoing rights in whole or in part and designate a lesser number of series b nominees for election as directors at any stockholder meeting for the election of directors, which waiver shall be effective until the next annual meeting of stockholders. (ii) in the event (a) the company shall be in arrears in whole or in part with regard to quarterly dividends as specified in section b.1 for three (3) consecutive dividend payment dates or (b) does not redeem the series b preferred stock on the redemption date as required in section b.4 or (c) a significant event occurs (the occurrence of any of the events described in (a), (b) or (c) being an "additional board election event"), and so long thereafter as such failure to pay dividends or redeem shares or significant event remains uncured (the "additional board election period"), the holders of the series b preferred stock shall have the right at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, voting as a class separate and apart from the common stock, to nominate and elect to the company's board such number of individuals (the "additional nominees") who, immediately after giving effect to their election together with the persons serving on the board pursuant to section b.4(d)(i), if any, represent a majority of the number of members constituting the company's board. a "significant event" shall mean and be deemed to exist with respect to the company if (i) the company files a voluntary petition, or there is filed against the company an involuntary petition, seeking relief under any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, (ii) a receiver is appointed for any of the company's properties or assets, (iii) the company makes or consents to the making of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or (iv) the company becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability or unwillingness to pay, its debts as they become due. if an additional board election event occurs, the following shall apply: (x) upon the request of the holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock, the company shall call a special meeting ("special meeting") of the company's stockholders as a result of the occurrence of an additional board election event, such special meeting to be held as soon as reasonably practicable but not later than sixty (60) days thereafter. the failure of the holders of the series b preferred stock to exercise their rights under this clause (x) shall not constitute a waiver of their right to exercise such right in the future. (y) at the special meeting and if a quorum consisting of the holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock are present in person or by proxy, the additional nominees shall be nominated and elected by the vote as a class of the series b preferred stock with each share of series b preferred stock entitled to one vote. once elected, the additional nominees shall serve until the additional board election period terminates, subject to their reelection each year by the series b preferred stock, as provided for herein, at the annual meeting of the company. (z) the additional board election period shall terminate by reason of the cure or waiver in writing (signed by the holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock) of the additional board election event and at such time, subject to revesting of such rights in the event of a subsequent occurrence of an additional board election event thereafter, the term of office of the additional nominees shall terminate with respect to such additional board election period, the right of the series b stock to nominate the additional nominees shall expire with respect to such additional board election period and the additional nominees shall thereupon be deemed to have been removed as members of the board. (iii) except as set forth in section b.3(d)(ii)(z), no board member elected by the holders of series b preferred stock pursuant to this section b.3(d) (a "nominee") may be removed from the board without the consent of the holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock voting together as a class, with each share of series b preferred stock having one vote. any vacancy on the board caused by the death, resignation or removal of any nominee shall be filled promptly by another person nominated by the holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock at a special meeting of the company's stockholders held for that purpose. upon the request of the holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock, the company shall call a special meeting of the company's stockholders as a result of any vacancy on the board caused by the death, resignation or removal of any nominee; such special meeting shall be held as soon as reasonably practicable but not later than sixty (60) days thereafter (or such shorter period as may be permitted by law). the failure of the holders of the series b preferred stock to exercise their rights under this subsection (iii) shall not constitute a waiver of their right to exercise such right in the future. at the special meeting and if a quorum consisting of the holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock are present in person or by proxy, the person designated by the holders of series b preferred stock to fill such vacancy shall be nominated and elected by the vote as a class of the series b preferred stock with each share of series b preferred stock entitled to one vote.

(a) optional redemption on or before january 16, 2002 at option of majority holders. if, on or before january 16, 2002, the company completes successfully a registered public offering resulting in gross proceeds to the company of more than $15,000,000 but less than or equal to $20,000,000, each holder of series b preferred stock may elect to require the company to redeem not more than one-half (1/2) of the then issued and outstanding shares of series b preferred stock owned by such holder as provided below (a "section b.4(a) redemption") at an amount per share of series b preferred stock equal to the offering price per share of the common stock in such registered public offering (the "section b.4(a) redemption price"). upon such an election, an equal percentage of series b preferred stock held by any such holder shall be converted in accordance with the provisions of section b.6(b), below. as used herein, "registered public offering" shall refer to a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended, other than a registration effected in connection with an employee benefit plan or a transaction of a type specified in rule 145 under such act (or any successor thereto). not more than three days after the filing with the securities and exchange commission of the registration statement related to the registered public offering, the company shall send notice of the registered public offering by first-class certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the holders of the shares of series b preferred stock at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the company. the notice shall refer to this section b.4(a), shall specify the projected closing date and the estimated range of the offering price per share of the common stock in such registered public offering and shall include a copy of the preliminary prospectus filed by the company with the sec relating to the registered public offering. each holder of series b preferred stock shall have the right, at any time on or before the 15th day after the date on which the company mailed such notice, to deliver written notice (the "election notice") to the company electing to have a specified portion (but not more than 1/2) of such holder's series b preferred stock redeemed by the company pursuant to this section b.4(a); provided such election may be conditioned upon the section b.4(a) redemption price being not less than the minimum amount specified in such holder's election notice. the company shall promptly notify (the "section b.4(a) redemption notice") each holder of series b preferred stock of the number of shares of series b preferred stock held by such holder which are being redeemed pursuant to this section. the redemption (and conversion pursuant to section b.6(b)) shall occur and be effective in all respects on the same day on which the registered public offering is consummated (the "section b.4(a) redemption date"), and thereafter the holder of shares being redeemed pursuant to this section b.4(a) shall have only the rights set forth in sections b.4(d) and section b.4(e) hereof. before, on or after the section b.4(a) redemption date, each holder of series b preferred stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the company the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the section b.4(a) redemption notice, and thereupon the section b.4(a) redemption price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificates shall be cancelled. the company shall promptly reissue to such holders (or their nominees) certificates evidencing the shares of series b preferred stock represented by the surrendered certificates which are not redeemed. (b) redemption at option of majority of holders. if the company does not successfully complete a registered public offering (as described in section b.4(a)) on or before january 16, 2002, then at any time after january 16, 2002 but only at any time during the first 10 days after each dividend payment date (the "redemption election period") the holders of a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of series b preferred stock (the "majority holders") may elect to require the company to redeem shares of series b preferred stock at an amount equal to the face value plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the respective dates of redemption of the shares (the "optional redemption price") in accordance with this section b.4(b). the majority holders may require the company to redeem with respect to each redemption election period up to that number of shares of series b preferred stock equal to 10% of the aggregate number of shares of series b preferred stock that the company has issued (whether or not then issued or outstanding, including shares of series b preferred stock that were issued and subsequently redeemed or otherwise cancelled) as of the beginning of such redemption election period. if the majority holders elect to cause such a redemption, they shall so notify the company in writing (the "redemption exercise notice"). upon receipt of the redemption exercise notice the company shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days of receipt of the redemption exercise notice) notify all holders of series b preferred stock of such election by sending a notice (the "optional redemption notice") by first class certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to the holders of series b preferred stock at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the company. the optional redemption notice shall refer to this section b.4(b) and shall specify the last day of the month following the month during which the company received the redemption exercise notice as the date on which shares of series b preferred stock will be redeemed in accordance with this section b.4(b) (the "optional redemption date"). the company shall promptly notify (the "section b.4(b) redemption notice") each holder of series b preferred stock of the number of shares of series b preferred stock held by such holder which are being redeemed pursuant to this section on an optional redemption date. an election by the majority holders in accordance with this section b.4(b) shall be binding upon all holders of the series b preferred stock, and series b preferred stock shall be redeemed pro rata among all holders of said shares to give effect to the provisions of this section b.4(b). upon receipt of the section b.4(b) redemption notice, and before, on or after the optional redemption date, each holder of series b preferred stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the company the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the section b.4(b) redemption notice, and thereupon the optional redemption price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificates shall be cancelled. the company shall promptly reissue to such holders (or their nominees) certificates evidencing any shares of series b preferred stock represented by the surrendered certificates which are not redeemed. (c) redemption at the option of the company. the company may at any time after january 16, 2003 redeem all of the then issued and outstanding shares of series b preferred stock as set forth in this section b.4(c) if all accrued dividends have been declared and paid to the holders of record of the outstanding shares of series b preferred stock through the most recent dividend payment date. the redemption shall occur on a date specified by the company (the "company redemption date"), which must be a date within ten (10) business days after a dividend payment date. the redemption price for any redemption pursuant to this section b.4(c) (the "company redemption price") shall be the face value of all of the outstanding shares of series b preferred stock plus an additional amount equal to 10% of the face value of such outstanding shares of series b preferred stock. not more than sixty (60) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the company redemption date, the company shall send notice of redemption pursuant to this section b.4(c) by first-class, certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to all of the holders of the shares of series b preferred stock at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the company. the notice shall refer to this section b.4(c) and shall specify the company redemption date and the time and place of the redemption. before, on or after the company redemption date, each holder of series b preferred stock shall surrender to the company the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the company redemption notice, and thereupon the company redemption price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. notwithstanding the foregoing, delivery by the company to the holders of the series b preferred stock of a company redemption notice pursuant to this section b.4(c) shall not prejudice or foreclose the rights of said holders to convert shares of series b preferred stock to common stock pursuant to section b.5(a) hereof so long as the conversion date (as defined in section b.5(c)(i)) precedes the company redemption date as defined herein. (d) provision for payment. "redemption date" shall refer to the section b.4(a) redemption date (in the case of redemptions governed by section b.4(a)), an optional redemption date (in the case of redemptions governed by section b.4(b)), and a company redemption date (in the case of redemptions governed by section b.4(c)). "redemption price" shall mean the amount to be paid by the company on a particular redemption date pursuant to section b.4(a), section b.4(b), or section b.4(c), as applicable. on or prior to each redemption date, the company shall deposit the redemption price of all shares of series b preferred stock designated for redemption on that redemption date with a bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the shares designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to pay the redemption price for such shares to their respective holders on or after the related redemption date upon receipt of notification from the company that such holder has surrendered his share certificate to the company pursuant to section b.4(a), section b.4(b), or section b.4(c) above. as of the redemption date, the deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares being redeemed on that redemption date, and from and after the redemption date the shares so called for redemption on that redemption date shall be redeemed and shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust corporation payment of the redemption price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor. the balance of any moneys deposited by the company pursuant to this section b.4(d) remaining unclaimed at the expiration of three (3) years following the redemption date shall thereafter be returned to the company upon its request expressed in a resolution of its board of directors. (e) rights upon redemption. from and after the redemption date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the redemption price, all rights of the holders of shares of series b preferred stock to be redeemed on that redemption date as holders of series b preferred stock (except the right to receive the redemption price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the company or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. if the funds of the company legally available for redemption of shares of series b preferred stock on any redemption date are insufficient to redeem the total number of shares of series b preferred stock to be redeemed on such date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of such shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of series b preferred stock or upon the respective holder elections. at any time thereafter when additional funds of the company in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) are legally available for the redemption of shares of series b preferred stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares which the company has become obliged to redeem on any redemption date, but which it has not redeemed. the shares of series b preferred stock not redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein. (f) cancellation of redeemed stock. any shares of series b preferred stock redeemed pursuant to this section shall be cancelled and shall not under any circumstances be reissued; and the company may from time to time take such appropriate corporate action as may be necessary to reduce accordingly the number of authorized shares of the company's capital stock. (g) acquisition by company. the company will not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the company to, purchase or acquire any shares of series b preferred stock otherwise than pursuant to (a) the terms of this section b.4 or (b) an offer made on the same terms to all holders of series b preferred stock at the time outstanding. 5. optional conversion. the holders of the series b preferred stock shall have conversion rights as described in this section b.5 (the "conversion rights"). in the event of a liquidation of the company, the conversion rights shall terminate at the close of business on the first full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any amounts distributable on liquidation to the holders of series b preferred stock. (a) right to convert. each share of series b preferred stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, upon surrender of certificates representing shares of series b preferred stock and without payment of any further consideration, into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock (or rights to acquire common stock) described in section b.5(a)(i) hereof at an effective conversion price per share (the "conversion price") described in section b.5(a)(ii) hereof, subject to adjustment as provided below. the date on which any such right to convert is exercised as provided in section b.5(c) hereof is hereinafter referred to as the "conversion date." (i) number of shares. any additional shares of common stock issued by the company at any time or from time to time after january 16, 1997 (the "base date") and before any applicable conversion date at a price per share that is less than the then applicable conversion price (but not including any shares issued as dividends or distributions as provided in section b.5(f) or upon a stock split or combination as provided in section b.5(e); any shares issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred stock; any shares issuable upon exercise of any options granted pursuant to the terms of the company's stock option plans existing and as in effect on the base date, or up to 300,000 additional shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options granted after the base date pursuant to the terms of any option plan or arrangement of the company adopted after the base date, including any shares of common stock issuable as a result of antidilution provisions of any such options; and any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants granted in connection with the company's 1995 11.50% subordinated notes, such warrants have been amended through the base date, including any shares issuable as a result of antidilution provisions of such warrants) shall be referred to herein as "adjustment shares." the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each share of the series b preferred stock tendered for conversion pursuant to the terms of this section b.5 on any date from and after the base date shall initially be equal to 5.26795. for purposes of this section b.5, the term "initial number of fully diluted shares" shall mean 10,974,895 shares of common stock, which number is equal to the sum of (i) the total number of shares common stock issued and outstanding at the base date; plus (ii) the sum of the total number of shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted pursuant to the terms of the company's stock option plans existing and as in effect on the base date plus 300,000 additional shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of options granted after the base date pursuant to the terms of any option plan or arrangement of the company adopted after the base date plus the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants granted in connection with the company's 1995 11.50% subordinated notes, as such warrants have been amended through the base date; plus (iii) the number of shares of common stock that would represent 24% of the initial number of fully diluted shares. the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each share of the series b preferred stock shall be adjusted upon the issuance of any adjustment shares, on any date from and after the base date, to equal the total number of shares determined by the following formula, rounded to the nearest 1/100,000 of a share: (a).24 multiplied by (b) the sum of (aa) the initial number of fully diluted shares plus (bb) the quotient of (aaa) the number of shares of adjustment shares issued and outstanding at the conversion date, divided by (bbb) 1 minus .24, divided by (c) the total number of shares of series b preferred stock issued and outstanding on the base date. (ii) conversion price. the conversion price per share shall initially be equal to $1.898. (b) fractional shares. no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of the series b preferred stock. in lieu of fractional shares, the company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective conversion price. (c) mechanics of conversion. (i) in order to convert shares of series b preferred stock into shares of common stock, the holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of series b preferred stock, duly endorsed, at the office of the transfer agent (or at the principal office of the company if the company serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares represented by such certificate or certificates. such notice shall state such holder's name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued. the date of receipt of such certificates and notice by the transfer agent or the company shall be the conversion date ("conversion date"). the company shall, as soon as practicable after the conversion date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder, or to his nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share. (ii) the company shall at all times during which the series b preferred stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the series b preferred stock (whether pursuant to this section b.5 or pursuant to section b.6), such number of its duly authorized shares of common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding series b preferred stock. before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the conversion price below the then par value of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred stock, the company will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock at such adjusted conversion price. (iii) all shares of series b preferred stock, which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive dividends, notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the conversion date, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of common stock in exchange therefor. any shares of series b preferred stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the company may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the number of shares of authorized series b preferred stock accordingly. (iv) if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the securities act of 1933, as amended, the conversion may at the option of any holder tendering series b preferred stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the consummation of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the series b preferred stock shall not be deemed to have converted such series b preferred stock until immediately prior to the closing of the sale of securities. (d) adjustment of conversion price upon issuance of adjustment shares. in the event the company shall at any time after the base date issue adjustment shares (excluding shares issued as a dividend or distribution as provided in section b.5(f) or upon a stock split or combination as provided in section b.5(e)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable conversion price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the conversion price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest 1/1000 of one cent) determined by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction, (a) the numerator of which shall be equal to the initial number of fully diluted shares, plus the quotient of (a) the aggregate consideration received by the company for adjustment shares issued and outstanding at the conversion date, divided by (b) the conversion price immediately preceding the event requiring such adjustment, (b) and the denominator of which shall be equal to the sum of the initial number of fully diluted shares plus the number of shares of adjustment shares issued and outstanding at the conversion date. for purposes of this section b.5(d), the consideration received by the company for the issue of any adjustment shares of common stock shall be computed as follows: (a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate of cash received by the company, excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends; (b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the board of directors; and (c) in the event adjustment shares of common stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the company for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a) and (b) above, as determined in good faith by the board of directors. (e) adjustment to conversion price for stock splits and combinations. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the base date effect a subdivision of the outstanding common stock, the conversion price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the base date combine the outstanding shares of common stock, the conversion price then in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. any adjustment under this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. (f) adjustment to conversion price for certain dividends and distributions. in the event the company at any time, or from time to time after the base date shall make or issue a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of common stock, then and in each such event the conversion price shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance, by multiplying the conversion price by a fraction: () the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance, and () the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance plus the number of shares of common stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution. (g) adjustments for other dividends and distributions. in the event the company at any time or from time to time after the base date shall make or issue a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the company other than shares of common stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of shares of the series b preferred stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of common stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the company that they would have received had their series b preferred stock been converted into common stock on the date of such event and had thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period given application to all adjustments called for during such period, under this paragraph with respect to the rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock. (h) adjustment for stock splits, reclassification, exchange, or substitution. if at any time from and after the base date the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series b preferred stock shall be subdivided or combined, if any additional shares of common stock are issued as a dividend or distribution of company securities, or if the common stock is otherwise changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a dividend or distribution as described in section b.5(g) above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each share of series b preferred stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such subdivision, combination, dividend, reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of series b preferred stock would have been converted immediately prior to such subdivision, combination, dividend, reorganization, reclassification, or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. (i) adjustment for merger or reorganization, etc. in case of any consolidation or merger of the company with or into another corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company to another corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity (other than a consolidation, merger or sale which is treated as a liquidation pursuant to section b.2(b)), (i) if the surviving entity shall consent in writing to the following provisions, then each share of series b preferred stock shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the company deliverable upon conversion of such series b preferred stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this section b.5 set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of the series b preferred stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this section b.5 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the conversion price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the series b preferred stock; or (ii) if the surviving entity shall not so consent, then each holder of series b preferred stock may, after receipt of notice specified in subsection (l) below ("notice of record date"), elect to convert such stock into common shares as provided in this section b.5 or to accept the distributions to which he shall be entitled under section b.2(a) and section b.2(b), assuming holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock have not voted, as per section b.2(b), that the merger or consolidation shall not be deemed to be a liquidation. (j) no impairment. the company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this section b.5 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock against impairment. (k) certificate as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the conversion price pursuant to this section b.5 or to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of series b preferred stock pursuant to section b, the company at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder, if any, of series b preferred stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based and shall file a copy of such certificate with its corporate records. the company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of series b preferred stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the conversion price then in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which then would be received upon the conversion of series b preferred stock. despite such adjustment or readjustment, the form of each or all series b preferred stock certificates, if the same shall reflect the initial or any subsequent conversion price, need not be changed in order for the adjustments or readjustments to be valued in accordance with the provisions of this certificate of designation, which shall control. (l) notice of record date. in the event: () that, without limiting the rights of the holders of series b preferred stock pursuant to section b.3, the company declares a dividend (or any other distribution) on its common stock payable in common stock or other securities of the company; () that the company subdivides or combines its outstanding shares of common stock; () of any reclassification of the common stock of the company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of common stock or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon), or of any consolidation or merger of the company into or with another corporation, or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company; or () of the involuntary or voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company; then the company shall cause to be filed at its principal office or at the office of the transfer agent of the series b preferred stock, and shall cause to be mailed to the holders of the series b preferred stock at their last addresses as shown on the records of the company or such transfer agent, at least ten days prior to the record date specified in (a) below or twenty days before the date specified in (b) below, a notice stating (m) the record date of such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of common stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination are to be determined, or (n) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of common stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution or winding up. 6. mandatory conversion. (a) registered public offering in excess of $20,000,000. upon the successful consummation of the sale of shares of common stock in a registered public offering resulting in gross proceeds to the company of more than $20,000,000 and at a price per share of common stock which is equal to or greater than (i) the aggregate face value of the issued and outstanding series b and series c preferred stock on such date, divided by (ii) the total number of shares of common stock that would have been issuable on the date of consummation of such offering upon conversion of the series b preferred stock in accordance with the terms of section b.5 hereof, (which minimum price shall hereinafter be referred to as the "minimum price"), then, effective upon the consummation of such registered public offering (the "conversion date"), all issued and outstanding shares of series b preferred stock not otherwise converted by the holders thereof on or before the consummation of such registered public offering shall automatically and without further action on the part of the respective holder or the company be converted into common stock at the then effective conversion price pursuant to section b.5 and all shares of series b preferred stock then outstanding shall be cancelled.
