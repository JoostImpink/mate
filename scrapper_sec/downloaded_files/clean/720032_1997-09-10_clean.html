showing all transactions, payments and receipts up to and including 5th april of each year will be sent to the client as soon as reasonably practicable after that date. communications page 70 of 198 pages 19. in the interests of proper administration of the portfolio and for related investment purposes johp, its representatives or employees, may call upon the client by telephone, visit or otherwise communicate orally with the client without express invitation. the client's attention is drawn to the fact that the client will forfeit any right conferred by section 56 of the financial services act 1986 to treat as unenforceable any investment agreement entered into in the course of or in consequence of such a call. administration 20. contract notes in respect of every purchase and sale on the client's behalf will be sent to the client before the close of business on the day next following the day on which the transaction was effected. 21. johp will on the client's request

vouchers and copies of entries in books or electronic recording media kept by johp or to which johp has access relating to the transactions effected by johp on the client's behalf and those records will be maintained by johp or johp will ensure that they are maintained for not less than seven years from the date of the relevant transaction. 23. all documents will be sent to the client at the address given above unless and until otherwise directed in writing. the client agrees that it will immediately notify johp in writing of any change of address, and that johp will not be responsible for any consequences which may arise from failure to do so. reviews and valuations 24. johp will prepare reviews of the portfolio incorporating an up-to-date valuation of each investment comprised in the portfolio and a statement of the basis on which it was valued on a six monthly basis or at such other frequency as may be agreed between johp and the client. such reviews shall be prepared as at such half yearly or other dates as shall be agreed between johp and the client from time to time (each such date being referred to as a "valuation date"), and johp will send such reviews to the client within twenty-five business days of each valuation date. 25. on each valuation date cash will be valued at its face value and each investment will be valued at its middle market price on the relevant stock exchange at the close of business on such day or (if not a business day) on the nearest prior business day as is supplied by "exshare" or any other suitable information service chosen by johp (which figures shall be binding save for manifest error). for the purpose of valuing in sterling any foreign currency or any security listed on a foreign stock exchange the price of which is quoted in currency other than sterling, the valuation and middle market exchange rates supplied by "exshare" or any other suitable information service chosen by johp shall be applied. in the absence of that valuation or exchange rate, the middle market price as determined by the daily official list of the stock exchange or the equivalent list for any relevant stock exchange will be applied. if none of the foregoing methods of valuation are available, the investments in question will be page 71 of 198 pages valued in such other manner (by johp or such other person selected by johp) as shall in johp's opinion be fair. 26. johp accepts no liability for any period longer than 25 business days between any valuation date and the despatch of a review to the client of his portfolio which has elapsed as result of any act or omission of any third party. voting and other rights 27. johp will be entitled at its discretion and without notice to the client to procure or to refrain from procuring the exercise of voting and other rights and privileges attaching to the investments comprised in the portfolio and to accede or refrain from acceding to any compromise or arrangement in relation to any scheme of arrangement or scheme for reconstruction or amalgamation involving any such investment. johp will not forward to the client any circulars, notices or proxy cards received in respect of investments comprised in the portfolio. fees, commissions and expenses 28. (a) the client will pay a management fee to johp in respect of the period beginning with first receipt by johp of any investments or money from the client and ending with a valuation date (as defined in paragraph 24) and each period thereafter starting with the day after any valuation date and ending on the next valuation date (or the termination date as defined in paragraph 39 if sooner). (b) the management fee shall be calculated in accordance with the `scale rates and charges' set out in schedule iii. (c) the management fee shall be payable not later than 14 days after despatch to the client of an invoice which shall be sent to the client as soon as is reasonably practicable after each valuation date. unless otherwise instructed the client's capital account will be debited with the amounts due to johp on the l4th day after despatch of such invoice. (d) in addition the client shall reimburse johp for any expenses or liabilities which it may incur in properly carrying out its duties hereunder. 29. the management fee shall be deemed to have accrued on a day-to-day basis, so that, if this agreement commences or terminates other than on a valuation date (as defined in paragraph 24), the amount of the fee shall be duly apportioned. 30. commissions (as set out in schedule iii) will be payable by the client on purchases and sales of investments together with all expenses including stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and vat thereon (if applicable). the client recognizes that johp may gain a commission benefit from dealing in a bulk purchase or sale on behalf of johp's clients, one of whom may be the client, or from return commissions which benefit johp shall be entitled to retain. johp will be free to accept and retain as an addition to its fees and commissions any other page 72 of 198 pages commissions which it receives in the course of its dealing on the client's behalf: all such benefits and receipts shall supplement any other remuneration receivable by johp in connection with transactions effected by johp with or for the client under this or any other agreement with the client and the client consents to all such benefits and receipts as are referred to above without prior disclosure of the same to the client on a case-by-case basis provided that johp undertakes to secure for the client best execution of all transactions affected with or through a party from whom johp receives such benefits and commissions, disregarding any benefit which the client might obtain directly or indirectly as a result of such arrangements. 31. johp shall be entitled to alter the manner of computing or charging its fees, commissions and expenses or of paying interest on the money held on the client's behalf in the capital account (including with prejudice to the generality of the foregoing its scale rates and charges) by giving one month's prior notice in writing to the client. responsibility and insurance 32. johp will indemnify the client in respect of any loss incurred as a result of negligence, wilful default or fraud by johp or any of its employees. subject to the above, johp will not be responsible or liable for any claim, loss, damage, expense or costs arising by reason of any of the following: (1) any investment decision taken and acted upon in accordance with the terms of this agreement; or (2) any delay or default in the performance of its obligations under this agreement arising in consequence of any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of johp; or (3) any act or omission on the part of any of the banks or nominee companies controlled by them or other eligible custodians as referred to in paragraph 15 or any other person to which any of them shall have delegated its function or on the part of any other third party whatsoever; or (4) any consequential loss suffered in consequence of any act or omission of johp or any breach of johp of any term of this agreement. 33. the client agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified johp from and against all demands, claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses whatsoever incurred by johp arising out of the breach by the client of any warranty or by reason of any failure by the client to comply with and/or perform any of the terms and conditions contained in this agreement. 34. where the client is a joint account (whether or not a trust account) johp shall unless and until otherwise directed in writing by all the persons named in the joint account, be entitled to act on the instructions of any of them and shall not in any whatsoever be liable to the others for doing so. page 73 of 198 pages 35. johp has effected insurance to provide for the protection of the client against losses arising from any negligence of johp or any dishonesty of employees of johp. 36. under section 54 of the financial services act 1986 the securities and investments board has established a scheme for compensating investors by which the client may be entitled to compensation in the event of johp's inability to meet any liabilities to the client. johp will make available to the client upon request a statement describing the client's rights to compensation under the scheme. delegation and use of agents 37. johp may delegate any of its functions under this agreement to an associate and may provide information about the client and the portfolio to any such associate but johp's liability to the client for all matters so delegated shall not be affected thereby. johp shall give to the client written notice of any delegation of a function which involves the exercise of its discretionary investment management powers. 38. johp may employ agents (including associates) to perform any administrative, dealing, custodial and ancillary services required to enable johp to perform its services under this agreement. johp undertakes to act in good faith and with due diligence in the choice and use of such agents. termination of agreement 39. this agreement may be terminated by either party by giving written notice of termination to the other at any time. termination shall take effect on the day upon which the other party actually receives the notice (the "termination date") provided that, where the client is a joint account, notice of termination by johp shall be given to every person named in the joint account and in such circumstances the termination date shall be deemed to be the day after the date of posting by first class recorded delivery or other appropriate means to all persons named in the joint account. 40. upon the termination date, johp will complete expeditiously all transactions in progress at termination but will not execute any further transactions for the client. upon all fees, commissions, expenses and other sums due to it and any other liabilities for which it may be or become liable in connection with the management of the portfolio being settled or adequately secured to the satisfaction of johp, johp will ensure that all investments and cash balances held on the client's behalf will, after any outstanding security registration, stock exchange settlements and other administrative matters have been completed and as soon as reasonably practicable, be transferred to the client or dealt with in accordance with the client's instructions, in all cases at the cost of the client. 41. termination will not affect accrued rights, existing commitments or any contractual provision intended to survive termination and will be without penalty or other additional payment except that johp may charge the client an amount equal to: page 74 of 198 pages (1) the relevant proportion of the management fee, corresponding to that part of the period ending on a valuation date by reference to which fees are payable, which has expired when this agreement is terminated; (2) any additional expenses which johp necessarily incurs in terminating this agreement; and (3) any losses necessarily realized in settling or concluding outstanding obligations. 42. the death, bankruptcy or other incapacity or, in the case of a body corporate, the cessation of business of the client or a petition being presented or a meeting being convened to consider a resolution for the liquidation of the client shall not of itself terminate johp's appointment; but johp may at its discretion treat its receipt of actual notice of any such events as if it were a written notice of termination from the client. 43. if the client is a joint account the client's obligations under this agreement shall be joint and several. on the death of any of the persons constituting the client (being survived by any such other person), the agreement shall not terminate and, except in the case of trustees, the interest of the deceased in the portfolio shall automatically enure to the benefit of the survivor(s) unless otherwise specified by notice in writing to johp. client warranties 44. the client warrants that the client is the beneficial owner (or the duly authorized agent of the beneficial owner) of the whole of the portfolio free from all liens, charges, encumbrances and restrictions on transfer except insofar as advised by the client to johp, and will so remain during the currency of this agreement. 45. the client warrants that the client is empowered to enter into this agreement without the consent or authority of any other party and in the case of a client being

by pre-paid letter, cable or telex. in the case of notice service by the client from within the united kingdom and of notice served upon the client at an address within the united kingdom the notice shall be sufficiently served if served by pre-paid letter. 53. if the client makes a complaint to johp verbally or in writing about any service johp has rendered to the client under this agreement the complaint shall immediately be referred to johp's chief executive or to a senior investment manager who was not involved in the circumstances relating to the complaint and who will investigate such

valuation - where applicable) schedule ii investment policy, guidelines and restrictions part i - investment policy including basis of measurement of performance the investment objectives are to maintain a maximum total return commensurate with safety and the protection of the underlying value of the capital of the fund. the performance will be measured against the f.t. all share index, any other appropriate index or measure of performance agreed upon by johp and the client. part ii - guidelines and restrictions 1. there will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in which the money comprised in the portfolio will be invested provided that the services to be provided by johp will not include advising on or effecting contingent liability transactions, nor will they, without the express authority of the client, relate to options, futures or contracts for differences (or to any right or interest in such investments). 2. the contents of the portfolio may be invested in any market save for the following: there shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of the portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment permitted hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating to overdraft contained in paragraph 6 of this agreement, under no circumstances will johp make investments on behalf of the client to a value in excess of the aggregate of the value of the funds and securities held by johp on behalf of the client in the accounts referred to in paragraph 16 of this agreement. page 77 of 198 pages part iii - risk warnings and risk disclosure statement investments denominated in foreign currencies if a liability of the client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a different currency, or if johp provides services under this agreement relating to an investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange rates may have an effect which may be either favorable or unfavorable on the investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise experienced on such investment. investments not readily realisable certain categories of investments comprised in the portfolio may not be readily realisable. you should be aware that there can be no certainty that market makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper information for determining their current value may not be available. warrants a warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the securities. warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement, unfavorable as well as favorable, in the price of the warrant. the prices of warrants can therefore be volatile. stabilisation this statement is made in compliance with rule 14 of chapter iv of the rules of imro. "we or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those securities. you should read the explanation below carefully. its purpose is to enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such securities, or, if so, whether you wish to authorize us generally to effect transactions in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you or whether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction is effected on your behalf. stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the public. stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa. the reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time before buyers are found for the securities on offer. page 78 of 198 pages as long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normally the issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to investors or allotted to institutions who were included in the new issue but who have decided not to continue participating. the effect of this may be to keep the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period of stabilising. the rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he may stabilize (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising. the fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilized does not in itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be relied upon as an indication that investors are interested in the new issue or interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place". page 79 of 198 pages schedule iii scale rates and charges management fees to be levied six monthly discretionary portfolio service 1% per annum on portfolios of up to (pound)2,500,000 large portfolios (over (pound)2,500,000) - by negotiation commission rates equities gilts/fixed interest 1.25% on transactions up to(pound)10,000 0.5% on transactions up to(pound) 10,000 10,000 0.50% thereafter 0.25% on the next(pound)40,000 0.125% thereafter (minimum commissions (pound)30 per contract) all transactions are subject to a handling charge of (pound)12.50 per transaction in the case of uk registered securities ((pound)20 for non-uk registered securities) value added tax this will be charged on the fees shown above at the appropriate rates where applicable page 80 of 198 pages for j o hambro & partners limited 20/1/96 date /s/ christopher mills - --------------------------------- ------------------------------------ for the client* for and on behalf of seaway limited 29th feb., 1996 date /s/ a.j. kanoo - -------------------------------- ------------------------------------- director /s/ - -------------------------------- ------------------------------------- regulus limited secretary - ---------------------------- *the client should sign here as follows.

(b) the management fee shall be calculated in accordance with the 'scale rates and charges' set out in schedule iii. (c) the management fee shall be payable not later than 14 days after despatch to the client of an invoice which shall be sent to the client as soon as is reasonably practicable after each valuation date. unless otherwise instructed the client's capital account will be debited with the amounts due to johp on the 14th day after despatch of such invoice. (d) in addition the client shall reimburse johp for any expenses or liabilities which it may incur in properly carrying out its duties hereunder. 29. the management fee shall be deemed to have accrued on a day-to-day basis, so that, if this agreement commences or terminates other than on a valuation date (as defined in paragraph 24), the amount of the fee shall be duly apportioned. 30. commissions (as set out in schedule iii) will be payable by the client on purchases and sales of investments together with all expenses including stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and vat thereon (if applicable). the client recognises that johp may gain a commission benefit from dealing in a bulk purchase or sale on behalf of johp's page 88 of 198 pages clients, one of whom may be the client, or from return commissions which benefit johp shall be entitled to retain. johp will be free to accept and retain as an addition to its fees and commissions any other commissions which it receives in the course of its dealing on the client's behalf: all such benefits and receipts shall supplement any other remuneration receivable by johp in connection with transactions effected by johp with or for the client under this or any other agreement with the client and the client consents to all such benefits and receipts as are referred to above without prior disclosure of the same to the client on a case-by-case basis provided that johp undertakes to secure for the client best execution of all transactions effected with or through a party from whom johp receives such benefits and commissions, disregarding any benefit which the client might obtain directly or indirectly as a result of such arrangements. 31. johp shall be entitled to alter the manner of computing or charging its fees, commissions and expenses or of paying interest on the money held on the client's behalf in the capital account (including with prejudice to the generality of the foregoing its scale rates and charges) by giving one month's prior notice in writing to the client. responsibility and insurance 32. johp will indemnify the client in respect of any loss incurred as a result of negligence, wilful default

investment decision taken and acted upon in accordance with the terms of this agreement; or (b) any delay or default in the performance of its obligations under this agreement arising in consequence of any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of johp; or (c) any act or omission on the part of any of the banks or nominee companies controlled by them or other eligible custodians as referred to in paragraph 15 or any other person to which any of them shall have delegated its function or on the part of any other third party whatsoever; or (d) any consequential loss suffered in consequence of any act or omission of johp or any breach of johp of any term of this agreement. 33. the client agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified johp from and against all demands, claims,

directed in writing by all the persons named in the joint account, be entitled to act on the instructions of any of them and shall not in any whatsoever be liable to the others for doing so. 35. johp has effected insurance to provide for the protection of the client against losses arising from any negligence of johp or any dishonesty of employees of johp. 36. under section 54 of the financial services act 1986 the securities and investments board has established a scheme for compensating investors by which the client may be entitled to compensation in the event of johp's inability to meet any liabilities to the client. johp will make available to the client upon request a statement describing the client's rights to compensation under the scheme. delegation and use of agents 37. johp may delegate any of its functions under this agreement to an associate and may provide information about the client and the portfolio to any such associate but johp's liability to the client for all matters so delegated shall not be affected thereby. johp shall give to the client written notice of any delegation of a function which involves the exercise of its discretionary investment management powers. 38. johp may employ agents (including associates) to perform any administrative, dealing, custodial and ancillary services required to enable johp to perform its services under this agreement.

of termination to the other at any time. termination shall take effect on the day upon which the other party actually receives the notice (the "termination date") provided that, where the client is a joint account, notice of termination by johp shall be given to every person named in the joint account and in such circumstances the termination date shall be deemed to be the day after the date of posting by first class recorded delivery or other appropriate means to all persons named in the joint account. 40. upon the termination date, johp will complete expeditiously all transactions in progress at termination but will not execute any further transactions for the client. upon all fees, commissions, expenses and other sums due to it and any other liabilities for which it may be or become liable in connection with the management of the portfolio being settled or adequately secured to the satisfaction of johp, johp will ensure that all investments and cash balances held on the client's behalf will, after any outstanding security registration, stock exchange settlements and other administrative matters have been completed and as soon as reasonably practicable, be transferred to the client or dealt with in accordance with the client's instructions, in all cases at the cost of the client. page 90 of 198 pages 41. termination will not affect accrued rights, existing commitments or any contractual provision intended to survive termination and will be without penalty or other additional payment except that johp may charge the client an amount equal to: (a) the relevant proportion of the management fee, corresponding to that part of the period ending on a valuation date by reference to which fees are payable, which has expired when this agreement is terminated; (b) any additional expenses which johp necessarily incurs in terminating this agreement; and (c) any losses necessarily realised in settling or concluding outstanding obligations. 42. the death, bankruptcy or other incapacity or, in the case of a body corporate, the cessation of business of the client or a petition being presented or a meeting being convened to consider a resolution for the liquidation of the client shall not of itself terminate johp's appointment; but johp may at its discretion treat its receipt of actual notice of any such events as if it were a written notice of termination from the client. 43. if the client is a joint account the client's obligations under this agreement shall be joint and several. on the death of any of the persons constituting the client (being survived by any such other person), the agreement shall not terminate and, except in the case of trustees, the interest of the deceased in the portfolio shall automatically enure to the benefit of the survivor(s) unless otherwise specified by notice in writing to johp. client warranties 44. the client warrants that the client is the beneficial owner (or the duly authorised agent of the beneficial owner) of the whole of the portfolio free from all liens, charges, encumbrances and restrictions on transfer except insofar as advised by the client to johp, and will so remain during

complaint shall immediately be referred to johp's chief executive or to a senior investment manager who was not involved in the circumstances relating to the complaint and who will investigate such

applicable) schedule ii investment policy, guidelines and restrictions part i - investment policy including basis of measurement of performance the investment objectives are to maintain a maximum total return commensurate with safety and the protection of the underlying value of the capital of the fund. the performance will be measured against the f.t. all share index, any other appropriate index or measure of performance agreed upon by johp and the client. part ii - guidelines and restrictions 1. there will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in which the money comprised in the portfolio will be invested provided that the services to be provided by johp will not include advising on or effecting contingent liability transactions, nor will they, without the express prior authority of the client, relate to options, futures or contracts for differences (or to any right or interest in such investments). 2. the contents of the portfolio may be invested in any market save for the following. there shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of the portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment permitted hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating to overdraft contained in paragraph 6 of this agreement, under no circumstances will johp make investments on behalf of the client to a value in excess of the aggregate of the value of the funds and securities held by johp on behalf of the client in the accounts referred to in paragraph 16 of this agreement. part iii - risk warnings and risk disclosure statement page 93 of 198 pages investments denominated in foreign currencies if a liability of the client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a different currency, or if johp provides services under this agreement relating to an investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange rates may have an effect which may be either favourable or unfavourable on the investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise experienced on such investment. investments not readily realisable certain categories of investments comprised in the portfolio may not be readily realisable. you should be aware that there can be no certainty that market makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper information for determining their current value may not be available. warrants a warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the securities. warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement, unfavourable as well as favourable, in the price of the warrant. the prices of warrants can therefore be volatile. stabilisation this statement is made in compliance with rule 14 of chapter iv of the rules of imro. "we or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those securities. you should read the explanation below carefully. its purpose is to enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such securities or, if so, whether you wish to authorise us generally to effect transactions in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you or whether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction is effected on your behalf. stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the public. stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa. the reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time before buyers are found for the securities on offer. as long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normally the issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to investors or allotted to institutions who were included in page 94 of 198 pages the new issue but who have decided not to continue participating. the effect of this may be to keep the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period of stabilising. the rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he may stabilise (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising. the fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilised does not in itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be relied upon as an indication that investors are interested in the new issue or interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place". page 95 of 198 pages schedule iii scale rates and charges management fees to be levied six monthly discretionary portfolio service 1% per annum on portfolios of up to

applicable) schedule ii investment policy, guidelines and restrictions part i - investment policy including basis of measurement of performance the investment objectives are to maintain a maximum total return commensurate with safety and the protection of the underlying value of the capital of the fund. the performance will be measured against the f.t. all share index, any other appropriate index or measure of performance agreed upon by johp and the client. part ii - guidelines and restrictions 1. there will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in which the money comprised in the portfolio will be invested provided that the services to be provided by johp will not include advising on or effecting contingent liability transactions, nor will they, without the express prior authority of the client, relate to options, futures or contracts for differences (or to any right or interest in such investments). 2. the contents of the portfolio may be invested in any market save for the following. there shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of the portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment permitted hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating to overdraft contained in paragraph 6 of this agreement, under no circumstances will johp make investment on behalf of the client to a value in excess of the aggregate of the value of the funds and securities held by johp on behalf of the client in the accounts referred to in paragraph 16 of this agreement. part iii - risk warnings and risk disclosure statement investments denominated in foreign currencies if a liability of the client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a different currency, or if johp provides services under this agreement relating to any investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange rates may have an effect which may be either favorable or unfavorable on the investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise experienced on such investment. page 109 of 198 pages investments not readily realisable certain categories of investments comprised in the portfolio may not be readily realisable. you should be aware that there can be no certainty that market makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper information for determining their current value may not be available. warrants a warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the securities. warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement, unfavorable as well as favorable, in the price of the warrant. the prices of warrants can therefore be volatile. stabilisation this statement is made in compliance with rule 14 of chapter iv of the rules of imro. "we or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those securities. you should read the explanation below carefully. its purpose is to enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such securities or, if so, whether you wish to authorize us generally to effect transaction in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you or whether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction in effected on your behalf. stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the public. stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa. the reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time before buyers are found for the securities on offer. as long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normal the issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to investors or allotted to institutions who were included in the new issue but who have decided not to continue participating. the effect of this may be to keep the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period of stabilising. the rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he may stabilize (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising. page 110 of 198 pages the fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilised does not in itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be relied upon as an indication that investors are interest in the new issue or interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place". schedule iii scale rates and charges management fees to be levied six monthly discretionary portfolio service 1% per annum on portfolios of up to (pound)2,500,000 large

service chosen by johp (which figures shall be binding save for manifest error). for the purpose of valuing in sterling any foreign currency or any security listed on a foreign stock exchange the price of which is quoted in currency other than sterling, the valuation and middle market exchange rates supplied by "exshare" or any other suitable information service chosen by johp shall be applied. in the absence of that valuation or exchange rate, the middle market price as determined by the daily official list of the stock exchange or the equivalent list for any relevant stock

(c) the management fee shall be payable not later than 14 days after despatch to the client of an invoice which shall be sent to the client as soon as is reasonably practicable after each valuation date. unless otherwise instructed the client's capital account will be debited with the amounts due to johp on the 14th day after despatch of such invoice.

apportioned. 30. commissions (as set out in schedule iii) will be payable by the client on purchases and sales of investments together with all expenses including stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and vat thereon (if applicable). the client recognises that johp may gain a commission benefit from dealing in a bulk purchase or sale on behalf of johp's clients, one of whom may be the client, or from return commissions which benefit johp shall be entitled to retain. johp will be free to accept and retain as an addition to its fees and commissions any other commissions which it receives in the course of its dealing on the client's behalf: all such benefits and receipts shall supplement any other remuneration receivable by johp in connection with transactions effected by johp with or for the client under this or any other agreement with the client and the client consents to all such benefits and receipts as are referred to above without prior disclosure of the same to the client on a case-by-case basis provided that johp undertakes to secure for the client best execution of all transactions effected with or through a party from whom johp receives such benefits and commissions, disregarding any benefit which the client might obtain directly or indirectly as a result of such arrangements. 31. johp shall be entitled to alter the manner of computing or charging its fees, commissions and expenses or of paying interest on the money held on the client's behalf in the capital account (including with prejudice to the generality of the foregoing its scale rates and charges)

or fraud by johp or any of its employees. subject to the above, johp will not be responsible or liable for any claim, loss, damage, expense or costs arising by reason of any of the following: (a) any investment decision taken and acted upon in accordance with the terms of this agreement; or (b) any delay or default in the performance of its obligations under this agreement arising in consequence of any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of johp; or (c) any act or omission on the part of any of the banks or nominee companies controlled by them or other eligible custodians as

directed in writing by all the persons named in the joint account, be entitled to act on the instructions of any of them and shall not in any whatsoever be liable to the others for doing so. 35. johp has effected insurance to provide for the protection of the client against losses arising from any negligence of johp or any dishonesty of employees of johp. 36. under section 54 of the financial services act 1986 the securities and investments board has established a scheme for compensating investors by which the client may be entitled to compensation in the event of johp's inability to meet any liabilities to the client. johp will make available to the client upon request a statement describing the client's rights to compensation under the scheme. delegation and use of agents 37. johp may delegate any of its functions under this agreement to an associate and may provide information about the client and the portfolio to any such associate but johp's liability to the client for all matters so delegated shall not be affected thereby. johp shall give to the client written notice of any delegation of a function which involves the exercise of its discretionary investment management powers. 38. johp may employ agents (including associates) to perform any administrative, dealing, custodial and ancillary services required to enable johp to perform its services under this agreement.

of termination to the other at any time. termination shall take effect on the day upon which the other party actually receives the notice (the "termination date") provided that, where the client is a

posting by first class recorded delivery or other appropriate means to all persons named in the joint account. 40. upon the termination date, johp will complete expeditiously all transactions in progress at termination but will not execute any further transactions for the page 152 of 198 pages client. upon all fees, commissions, expenses and other sums due to it and any other liabilities for which it may be or become liable in connection with the management of the portfolio being settled or adequately secured to the satisfaction of johp, johp will ensure that all investments and cash balances held on the client's behalf will, after any outstanding security registration, stock exchange settlements and other administrative matters have been completed and as soon as reasonably practicable, be transferred to the client or dealt with in accordance with the client's instructions, in all cases at the cost of the client. 41. termination will not affect accrued rights, existing commitments or any contractual provision intended to survive termination and will be without penalty or other additional payment except that johp may charge the client an amount equal to: (a) the relevant proportion of the management fee, corresponding to that part of the period ending on a valuation date by reference to which fees are payable, which has expired when this agreement is terminated; (b) any additional expenses which johp necessarily incurs in terminating this agreement; and (c) any losses necessarily realised in settling or concluding outstanding obligations. 42. the death, bankruptcy or other incapacity or, in the case of a body corporate, the cessation of business of the client or a petition being presented or a meeting being convened to consider a resolution for the liquidation of the client shall not of itself terminate johp's appointment; but johp may at its discretion treat its receipt of actual notice of any such events as if it were a written notice of termination from the client. 43. if the client is a joint account the client's obligations under this agreement shall be joint and several. on the death of any of the persons constituting the client (being survived by any such other person), the agreement shall not terminate and, except in the case of trustees, the interest of the deceased in the portfolio shall automatically enure to the benefit of the survivor(s) unless otherwise specified by notice in writing to johp. client warranties 44. the client warrants that the client is the beneficial owner (or the duly authorised agent of

share index, any other appropriate index or measure of performance agreed upon by johp and the client. part ii - guidelines and restrictions 1. there will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in which the money comprised in the portfolio will be invested provided that the services to be provided by johp will not include advising on or effecting contingent liability transactions, nor will they, without the express prior authority of the client, relate to options, futures or contracts for differences (or to any right or interest in such investments). 2. the contents of the portfolio may be invested in any market save for the following. there shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of the portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment permitted hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating to overdraft contained in paragraph 6 of this agreement, under no circumstances will johp make investments on behalf of the client to a value in excess of the aggregate of the value of the funds and securities held by johp on behalf of the client in the accounts referred to in paragraph 16 of this agreement. part iii - risk warnings and risk disclosure statement page 156 of 198 pages investments denominated in foreign currencies if a liability of the client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a different currency, or if johp provides services under this agreement relating to an investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange rates may have an effect which may be either favourable or unfavourable on the investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise experienced on such investment. investments not readily realisable certain categories of investments comprised in the portfolio may not be readily realisable. you should be aware that there can be no certainty that market makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper information for determining their current value may not be available. warrants a warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the securities. warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement, unfavourable as well as favourable, in the price of the warrant. the prices of warrants can therefore be volatile. stabilisation this statement is made in compliance with rule 14 of chapter iv of the rules of imro. "we or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those securities. you should read the explanation below carefully. its purpose is to enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such securities or, if so, whether you wish to authorise us generally to effect transactions in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you or whether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction is effected on your behalf. stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the public. stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa. the reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time before buyers are found for the securities on offer. page 157 of 198 pages as long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normally the issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to investors or allotted to institutions who were included in the new issue but who have decided not to continue participating. the effect of this may be to keep the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period of stabilising. the rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he may stabilise (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising. the fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilised does not in itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be relied upon as an indication that investors are interested in the new issue or interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place". page 158 of 198 pages schedule iii scale rates and charges management fees to be levied six monthly discretionary portfolio service 1% per annum on portfolios of up to

the portfolio and a statement of the basis on which it was valued on a six monthly basis or at such other frequency as may be agreed between johp and the client. such reviews shall be prepared as at such half yearly or other dates as shall be agreed between johp and the client from time to time (each such date being referred to as a "valuation date"), and johp will send such reviews to the client within twenty-five business days of each valuation date. 25. on each valuation date cash will be valued at its face value and each investment will be valued at its middle market price on the relevant stock exchange at the close of business on such day or (if not a business day) on the nearest prior business day as is supplied by "exshare" or any other suitable page 166 of 198 pages information service chosen by johp (which figures shall be binding save for manifest error). for the purpose of valuing in sterling any foreign currency or any security listed on a foreign stock exchange the price of which is quoted in currency other than sterling, the valuation and middle market exchange rates supplied by "exshare" or any other suitable information service chosen by johp shall be applied. in the absence of that valuation or exchange rate, the middle market price as determined by the daily official list of the stock exchange or the equivalent list for any relevant stock exchange will be applied. if none of the foregoing methods of valuation are available, the investments in question will be valued in such other manner (by johp or such other person selected by johp) as shall in johp's opinion be fair. 26. johp accepts no liability for any period longer than 25 business days between any valuation date and the despatch of a review to the client of his portfolio which has elapsed as a result of any act or omission of any third party. voting and other rights 27. johp will be entitled at its discretion and without notice to the client to procure or to refrain from procuring the exercise of voting and other rights and privileges attaching to the investments comprised in the portfolio and to accede or refrain from acceding to any compromise or arrangement in relation to any scheme of arrangement or scheme for reconstruction or amalgamation involving any such investment. johp will not forward to the client any circulars, notices or proxy cards received in respect of investments comprised in the portfolio. fees, commissions and expenses 28. (a) the client will pay a management fee to johp in respect of the period beginning with first receipt by johp of any investments or money from the client and ending with a valuation date (as defined in paragraph 24) and each period thereafter starting with the day after any valuation date and ending on the next valuation date (or the termination date as defined in paragraph 39 if sooner). (b) the management fee shall be calculated in accordance with the 'scale rates and charges' set out in schedule iii. (c) the management fee shall be payable not later than 14 days after despatch to the client of an invoice which shall be sent to the client as soon as is reasonably practicable after each valuation date. unless otherwise instructed the client's capital account will be debited with the amounts due to johp on the 14th day after despatch of such invoice. (d) in addition the client shall reimburse johp for any expenses or liabilities which it may incur in properly carrying out its duties hereunder. page 167 of 198 pages 29. the management fee shall be deemed to have accrued on a day-to-day basis, so that, if this agreement commences or terminates other than on a valuation date (as defined in paragraph 24), the amount of the fee shall be duly apportioned. 30. commissions (as set out in schedule iii) will be payable by the client on purchases and sales of investments together with all expenses including stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and vat thereon (if applicable). the client recognises that johp may gain a commission benefit from dealing in a bulk purchase or sale on behalf of johp's clients, one of whom may be the client, or from return commissions which benefit johp shall be entitled to retain. johp will be free to accept and retain as an addition to its fees and commissions any other commissions which it receives in the course of its dealing on the client's behalf: all such benefits and receipts shall supplement any other remuneration receivable by johp in connection with transactions effected by johp with or for the client under this or any other agreement with the client and the client consents to all such benefits and receipts as are referred to above without prior disclosure of the same to the client on a case-by-case basis provided that johp undertakes to secure for the client best execution of all transactions effected with or through a party from whom johp receives such benefits and commissions, disregarding any benefit which the client might obtain directly or indirectly as a result of such arrangements. 31. johp shall be entitled to alter the manner of computing or charging its fees, commissions and expenses or of paying interest on the money held on the client's behalf in the capital account (including with prejudice to the generality of the foregoing its scale rates and charges) by giving one month's prior notice in writing to the client. responsibility and insurance 32. johp will indemnify the client in respect of any loss incurred as a result of negligence, wilful default or fraud by johp or any of its employees. subject to the above, johp will not be responsible or liable for any claim, loss, damage, expense or costs arising by reason of any of the following: (a) any investment decision taken and acted upon in accordance with the terms of this agreement; or (b) any delay or default in the performance of its obligations under this agreement arising in consequence of any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of johp; or (c) any act or omission on the part of any of the banks or nominee companies controlled by them or other eligible custodians as referred to in paragraph 15 or any other person to which any of them shall have delegated its function or on the part of any other third party whatsoever; or (d) any consequential loss suffered in consequence of any act or omission of johp or any breach of johp of any term of this agreement. page 168 of 198 pages 33. the client agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified johp from and against all demands, claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses whatsoever incurred by johp arising out of the breach by the client of any warranty or by reason of any failure by the client to comply with and/or perform any of the terms and conditions contained in this agreement. 34. where the client is a joint account (whether or not a trust account) johp shall unless and until otherwise directed in writing by all the persons named in the joint account, be entitled to act on the instructions of any of them and shall not in any whatsoever be liable to the others for doing so. 35. johp has effected insurance to provide for the protection of the client against losses arising from any negligence of johp or any dishonesty of employees of johp. 36. under section 54 of the financial services act 1986 the securities and investments board has established a scheme for compensating investors by which the client may be entitled to compensation in the event of johp's inability to meet any liabilities to the client. johp will make available to the client upon request a statement describing the client's rights to compensation under the scheme. delegation and use of agents 37. johp may delegate any of its functions under this agreement to an associate and may provide information about the client and the portfolio to any such associate but johp's liability to the client for all matters so delegated shall not be affected thereby. johp shall give to the client written notice of any delegation of a function which involves the exercise of its discretionary investment management powers. 38. johp may employ agents (including associates) to perform any administrative, dealing, custodial and ancillary services required to enable johp to perform its services under this agreement. johp undertakes to act in good faith and with due diligence in the choice and use of such agents. termination of agreement 39. this agreement may be terminated by either party by giving written notice of termination to the other at any time. termination shall take effect on the day upon which the other party actually receives the notice (the "termination date") provided that, where the client is a joint account, notice of termination by johp shall be given to every person named in the joint account and in such circumstances the termination date shall be deemed to be the day after the date of posting by first class recorded delivery or other appropriate means to all persons named in the joint account. 40. upon the termination date, johp will complete expeditiously all transactions in progress at termination but will not execute any further transactions for the client. upon all fees, commissions, expenses and other sums due to it and any page 169 of 198 pages other liabilities for which it may be or become liable in connection with the management of the portfolio being settled or adequately secured to the satisfaction of johp, johp will ensure that all investments and cash balances held on the client's behalf will, after any outstanding security registration, stock exchange settlements and other administrative matters have been completed and as soon as reasonably practicable, be transferred to the client or dealt with in accordance with the client's instructions, in all cases at the cost of the client. 41. termination will not affect accrued rights, existing commitments or any contractual provision intended to survive termination and will be without penalty or other additional payment except that johp may charge the client an amount equal to: (a) the relevant proportion of the management fee, corresponding to that part of the period ending on a valuation date by reference to which fees are payable, which has expired when this agreement is terminated; (b) any additional expenses which johp necessarily incurs in terminating this agreement; and (c) any losses necessarily realised in settling or concluding outstanding obligations. 42. the death, bankruptcy or other incapacity or, in the case of a body corporate, the cessation of business of the client or a petition being presented or a meeting being convened to consider a resolution for the liquidation of the client shall not of itself terminate johp's appointment; but johp may at its discretion treat its receipt of actual notice of any such events as if it were a written notice of termination from the client. 43. if the client is a joint account the client's obligations under this agreement shall be joint and several. on the death of any of the persons constituting the client (being survived by any such other person), the agreement shall not terminate and, except in the case of trustees, the interest of the deceased in the portfolio shall automatically enure to the benefit of the survivor(s) unless otherwise specified by notice in writing to johp. client warranties 44. the client warrants that the client is the beneficial owner (or the duly authorised agent of the beneficial owner) of the whole of the portfolio free from all liens, charges, encumbrances and restrictions on transfer except insofar as advised by the client to johp, and will so remain during the currency of this agreement. 45. the client warrants that the client is empowered to enter into this agreement without the consent or authority of any other party and in the case of a client being

by pre-paid letter, cable or telex. in the case of notice served by the client from within the united kingdom and of notice served upon the client at an address within the united kingdom the notice shall be sufficiently served if served by pre-paid letter. 53. if the client makes a complaint to johp verbally or in writing about any service johp has rendered to the client under this agreement the complaint shall immediately be referred to johp's chief executive or to a senior investment manager who was not involved in the circumstances relating to the complaint and who will investigate such circumstances. upon the conclusion of his investigation he shall make a written report to the client and take any action he deems necessary to rectify the matter which is the subject of the complaint.

letter/opening valuation - where applicable) schedule ii investment policy, guidelines and restrictions part i - investment policy including basis of measurement of performance the investment objectives are to maintain a maximum total return commensurate with safety and the protection of the underlying value of the capital of the fund. the performance will be measured against the f.t. all share index, any other appropriate index or measure of performance agreed upon by johp and the client. part ii - guidelines and restrictions 1. there will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in which the money comprised in the portfolio will be invested provided that the services to be provided by johp will not include advising on or effecting contingent liability transactions, nor will they, without the express prior authority of the client, relate to options, futures or contracts for differences (or to any right or interest in such investments). 2. the contents of the portfolio may be invested in any market save for the following. there shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of the portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment permitted hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating to overdraft contained in paragraph 6 of this agreement, under no circumstances will johp make investments on behalf of the client to a value in excess of the aggregate of the value of the funds and securities held by johp on behalf of the client in the accounts referred to in paragraph 16 of this agreement. part iii - risk warnings and risk disclosure statement page 173 of 198 pages investments denominated in foreign currencies if a liability of the client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a different currency, or if johp provides services under this agreement relating to an investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange rates may have an effect which may be either favourable or unfavourable on the investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise experienced on such investment. investments not readily realisable certain categories of investments comprised in the portfolio may not be readily realisable. you should be aware that there can be no certainty that market makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper information for determining their current value may not be available. warrants a warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the securities. warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement, unfavourable as well as favourable, in the price of the warrant. the prices of warrants can therefore be volatile. stabilisation this statement is made in compliance with rule 14 of chapter iv of the rules of imro. "we or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those securities. you should read the explanation below carefully. its purpose is to enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such securities or, if so, whether you wish to authorise us generally to effect transactions in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you or whether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction is effected on your behalf. stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the public. stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa. the reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time before buyers are found for the securities on offer. page 174 of 198 pages as long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normally the issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to investors or allotted to institutions who were included in the new issue but who have decided not to continue participating. the effect of this may be to keep the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period of stabilising. the rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he may stabilise (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising. the fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilised does not in itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be relied upon as an indication that investors are interested in the new issue or interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place". page 175 of 198 pages schedule iii scale rates and charges management fees to be levied six monthly discretionary portfolio service 1% per annum on portfolios of up to

the portfolio and a statement of the basis on which it was valued on a six monthly basis or at such other frequency as may be agreed between johp and the client. such reviews shall be prepared as at such half yearly or other dates as shall be agreed between johp and the client from time to time (each such date being referred to as a "valuation date"), and johp will send such reviews to the client within twenty-five business days of each valuation date. 25. on each valuation date cash will be valued at its face value and each investment will be valued at its middle market price on the relevant stock exchange at the close of business on such day or (if not a business day) on the nearest prior business day as is supplied by "exshare" or any other suitable page 183 of 198 pages information service chosen by johp (which figures shall be binding save for manifest error). for the purpose of valuing in sterling any foreign currency or any security listed on a foreign stock exchange the price of which is quoted in currency other than sterling, the valuation and middle market exchange rates supplied by "exshare" or any other suitable information service chosen by johp shall be applied. in the absence of that valuation or exchange rate, the middle market price as determined by the daily official list of the stock exchange or the equivalent list for any relevant stock exchange will be applied. if none of the foregoing methods of valuation are available, the investments in question will be valued in such other manner (by johp or such other person selected by johp) as shall in johp's opinion be fair. 26. johp accepts no liability for any period longer than 25 business days between any valuation date and the despatch of a review to the client of his portfolio which has elapsed as a result of any act or omission of any third party. voting and other rights 27. johp will be entitled at its discretion and without notice to the client to procure or to refrain from procuring the exercise of voting and other rights and privileges attaching to the investments comprised in the portfolio and to accede or refrain from acceding to any compromise or arrangement in relation to any scheme of arrangement or scheme for reconstruction or amalgamation involving any such investment. johp will not forward to the client any circulars, notices or proxy cards received in respect of investments comprised in the portfolio. fees, commissions and expenses 28.

(b) the management fee shall be calculated in accordance with the'scale rates and charges' set out in schedule iii. (c) the management fee shall be payable not later than 14 days after despatch to the client of an invoice which shall be sent to the client as soon as is reasonably practicable after each valuation date. unless otherwise instructed the client's capital account will be debited with the amounts due to johp on the 14th day after despatch of such invoice. (d) in addition the client shall reimburse johp for any expenses or liabilities which it may incur in properly carrying out its duties hereunder. page 184 of 198 pages 29. the management fee shall be deemed to have accrued on a day-to-day basis, so that, if this agreement commences or terminates other than on a valuation date (as defined in paragraph 24), the amount of the fee shall be duly apportioned. 30. commissions (as set out in schedule iii) will be payable by the client on purchases and sales of investments together with all expenses including stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and vat thereon (if applicable). the client recognises that johp may gain a commission benefit from dealing in a bulk purchase or sale on behalf of johp's clients, one of whom may be the client, or from return commissions which benefit johp shall be entitled to retain. johp will be free to accept and retain as an addition to its fees and commissions any other commissions which it receives in the course of its dealing on the client's behalf: all such benefits and receipts shall supplement any other remuneration receivable by johp in connection with transactions effected by johp with or for the client under this or any other agreement with the client and the client consents to all such benefits and receipts as are referred to above without prior disclosure of the same to the client on a case-by-case basis provided that johp undertakes to secure for the client best execution of all transactions effected with or through a party from whom johp receives such benefits and commissions, disregarding any benefit which the client might obtain directly or indirectly as a result of such arrangements. 31. johp shall be entitled to alter the manner of computing or charging its fees, commissions and expenses or of paying interest on the money held on the client's behalf in the capital account (including with prejudice to the generality of the foregoing its scale rates and charges) by giving one month's prior notice in writing to the client. responsibility and insurance 32. johp will indemnify the client in respect of any loss incurred as a result of negligence, wilful default or fraud by johp or any of its employees. subject to the above, johp will not be responsible or liable for any claim, loss, damage, expense or costs arising by reason of any of the following: (a) any investment decision taken and acted upon in accordance with the terms of this agreement; or (b) any delay or default in the performance of its obligations under this agreement arising in consequence of any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of johp; or (c) any act or omission on the part of any of the banks or nominee companies controlled by them or other eligible custodians as referred to in paragraph 15 or any other person to which any of them shall have delegated its function or on the part of any other third party whatsoever; or (d) any consequential loss suffered in consequence of any act or omission of johp or any breach of johp of any term of this agreement. page 185 of 198 pages 33. the client agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified johp from and against all demands, claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses whatsoever incurred by johp arising out of the breach by the client of any warranty or by reason of any failure by the client to comply with and/or perform any of the terms and conditions contained in this agreement. 34. where the client is a joint account (whether or not a trust account) johp shall unless and until otherwise directed in writing by all the persons named in the joint account, be entitled to act on the instructions of any of them and shall not in any whatsoever be liable to the others for doing so. 35. johp has effected insurance to provide for the protection of the client against losses arising from any negligence of johp or any dishonesty of employees of johp. 36. under section 54 of the financial services act 1986 the securities and investments board has established a scheme for compensating investors by which the client may be entitled to compensation in the event of johp's inability to meet any liabilities to the client. johp will make available to the client upon request a statement describing the client's rights to compensation under the scheme. delegation and use of agents 37. johp may delegate any of its functions under this agreement to an associate and may provide information about the client and the portfolio to any such associate but johp's liability to the client for all matters so delegated shall not be affected thereby. johp shall give to the client written notice of any delegation of a function which involves the exercise of its discretionary investment management powers. 38. johp may employ agents (including associates) to perform any administrative, dealing, custodial and ancillary services required to enable johp to perform its services under this agreement. johp undertakes to act in good faith and with due diligence in the choice and use of such agents. termination of agreement 39. this agreement may be terminated by either party by giving written notice of termination to the other at any time. termination shall take effect on the day upon which the other party actually receives the notice (the "termination date") provided that, where the client is a joint account, notice of termination by johp shall be given to every person named in the joint account and in such circumstances the termination date shall be deemed to be the day after the date of posting by first class recorded delivery or other appropriate means to all persons named in the joint account. 40. upon the termination date, johp will complete expeditiously all transactions in progress at termination but will not execute any further transactions for the page 186 of 198 pages client. upon all fees, commissions, expenses and other sums due to it and any other liabilities for which it may be or become liable in connection with the management of the portfolio being settled or adequately secured to the satisfaction of johp, johp will ensure that all investments and cash balances held on the client's behalf will, after any outstanding security registration, stock exchange settlements and other administrative matters have been completed and as soon as reasonably practicable, be transferred to the client or dealt with in accordance with the client's instructions, in all cases at the cost of the client. 41. termination will not affect accrued rights, existing commitments or any contractual provision intended to survive termination and will be without penalty or other additional payment except that johp may charge the client an amount equal to: (a) the relevant proportion of the management fee, corresponding to that part of the period ending on a valuation date by reference to which fees are payable, which has expired when this agreement is terminated; (b) any additional expenses which johp necessarily incurs in terminating this agreement; and (c) any losses necessarily realised in settling or concluding outstanding obligations. 42. the death, bankruptcy or other incapacity or, in the case of a body corporate, the cessation of business of the client or a petition being presented or a meeting being convened to consider a resolution for the liquidation of the client shall not of itself terminate johp's appointment; but johp may at its discretion treat its receipt of actual notice of any such events as if it were a written notice of termination from the client. 43. if the client is a joint account the client's obligations under this agreement shall be joint and several. on the death of any of the persons constituting the client (being survived by any such other person), the agreement shall not terminate and, except in the case of trustees, the interest of the deceased in the portfolio shall automatically enure to the benefit of the survivor(s) unless otherwise specified by notice in writing to johp. client warranties 44. the client warrants that the client is the beneficial owner (or the duly authorised agent of the beneficial owner) of the whole of the portfolio free from all liens, charges, encumbrances and restrictions on transfer except insofar as advised by the client to johp, and will so remain during the currency of this agreement. 45. the client warrants that the client is empowered to enter into this agreement without the consent or authority of any other party and in the case of a client being

by pre-paid letter, cable or telex. in the case of notice served by the client from within the united kingdom and of notice served upon the client at an address within the united kingdom the notice shall be sufficiently served if served by pre-paid letter. 53. if the client makes a complaint to johp verbally or in writing about any service johp has rendered to the client under this agreement the complaint shall immediately be referred to johp's chief executive or to a senior investment manager who was not involved in the circumstances relating to the complaint and who will investigate such circumstances. upon the conclusion of his investigation he shall make a written report to the client and take any action he deems necessary to rectify the matter which is the subject of the complaint.

the complaint direct to imro or the investment ombudsman without prior reference to johp. 54. each party to this agreement shall respect and protect the confidentiality of information acquired in consequence of it and shall not disclose such information to any third party save in the course of giving effect to this agreement or as may be required by law, or where requested by regulatory page

letter/opening valuation - where applicable) schedule ii investment policy, guidelines and restrictions part i - investment policy including basis of measurement of performance the investment objectives are to maintain a maximum total return commensurate with safety and the protection of the underlying value of the capital of the fund. the performance will be measured against the f.t. all share index, any other appropriate index or measure of performance agreed upon by johp and the client. part ii - guidelines and restrictions 1. there will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in which the money comprised in the portfolio will be invested provided that the services to be provided by johp will not include advising on or effecting contingent liability transactions, nor will they, without the express prior authority of the client, relate to options, futures or contracts for differences (or to any right or interest in such investments). 2. the contents of the portfolio may be invested in any market save for the following. there shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of the portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment permitted hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating to overdraft contained in paragraph 6 of this agreement, under no circumstances will johp make investments on behalf of the client to a value in excess of the aggregate of the value of the funds and securities held by johp on behalf of the client in the accounts referred to in paragraph 16 of this agreement. part iii - risk warnings and risk disclosure statement page 190 of 198 pages investments denominated in foreign currencies if a liability of the client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a different currency, or if johp provides services under this agreement relating to an investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange rates may have an effect which may be either favourable or unfavourable on the investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise experienced on such investment. investments not readily realisable certain categories of investments comprised in the portfolio may not be readily realisable. you should be aware that there can be no certainty that market makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper information for determining their current value may not be available. warrants a warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the securities. warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement, unfavourable as well as favourable, in the price of the warrant. the prices of warrants can therefore be volatile. stabilisation this statement is made in compliance with rule 14 of chapter iv of the rules of imro. "we or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those securities. you should read the explanation below carefully. its purpose is to enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such securities or, if so, whether you wish to authorise us generally to effect transactions in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you or whether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction is effected on your behalf. stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the public. stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa. the reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time before buyers are found for the securities on offer. page 191 of 198 pages as long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normally the issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to investors or allotted to institutions who were included in the new issue but who have decided not to continue participating. the effect of this may be to keep the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period of stabilising. the rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he may stabilise (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising. the fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilised does not in itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be relied upon as an indication that investors are interested in the new issue or interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place". page 192 of 198 pages schedule iii scale rates and charges management fees to be levied six monthly discretionary portfolio service 1% per annum on portfolios of up to (pound)2,500,000 large portfolios (over (pound)2,500,000) -
