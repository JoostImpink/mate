such information also constitutes the bdtv iii schedule 13d): as previously reported, on july 17, 1997, the company consummated the transactions contemplated by the stock exchange agreement and acquired 12,283,014 shares of ticketmaster common stock from paul g. allen in exchange for the issuance to mr. allen of 7,238,507 shares of common stock (the "allen shares"). no members of the tag-along group exercised the tag-along rights provided them under the ticketmaster stockholder agreement prior to the closing and, as a result, no shares were issued to the members of the tag-along group. however, the company has agreed that in connection with the stock exchange agreement, it will extend the period during which frederic d. rosen may exercise his tag-along rights in respect of the 306,208 shares of ticketmaster common stock covered by the shareholders agreement, dated as of december 15, 1993, by and among mr. allen, mr. rosen and certain other parties (the "shareholders agreement"). mr. rosen may exercise, and the company will honor, mr. rosen's tag-along rights under the shareholders agreement, provided that mr. rosen notifies the company of his decision to exercise his tag-along rights no later than january 6, 1998. pursuant to the terms of the stock exchange agreement, in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, mr. allen, mr. rosen and william savoy were appointed to the company's board of directors. in accordance with the terms of the diller-liberty-allen stockholders agreement, each of mr. diller and tci is obligated to vote all shares of voting stock of the company over which he or it may then exercise voting power, at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the company called for the purpose of the election of directors or to execute written consents of stockholders without a meeting with respect to the election of directors, in favor of mr. allen or a designee of mr. allen acceptable to the company, so long as mr. allen is entitled to representation on the company's board of directors under the stock exchange agreement. the diller-liberty-allen stockholder agreement will terminate (as will mr. allen's right under the stock exchange agreement to representation on the company's board of directors) upon the disposition by mr. allen and his permitted transferees collectively, in one or more transactions, to third parties of one-third or more of the shares of common stock acquired by mr. allen under the stock exchange agreement; provided, however, that the -------- ------- diller-liberty-allen stockholder agreement will terminate earlier (as will mr. allen's right under the stock exchange agreement to representation on the company's board of directors) if mr. allen and his permitted transferees do not beneficially own at least 5% of the company's outstanding equity securities (assuming for this purpose that all company equity securities issuable under the liberty agreements (as defined in the stock exchange agreement) are outstanding). as previously reported in the schedule 13d, a number of the shares of class b common stock issuable to liberty hsn pursuant to the home shopping merger were not issued, but instead are represented by the contingent rights which contractually obligate the company to issue to liberty hsn the contingent rights shares upon the occurrence of certain events, including a change in applicable fcc regulations or other event that would permit liberty hsn to have an indirect equity interest in the page 9 of _ pages company greater than the indirect equity interest represented by the number of shares of common stock which it then owns (directly and indirectly). also, as previously disclosed, in connection with the home shopping merger the company and liberty hsn entered into the exchange agreement. pursuant to the exchange agreement, at such time or from time to time following the issuance to it of all contingent shares as liberty hsn or its permitted transferee may be allowed under applicable fcc authority to have an indirect equity interest in the company greater than the indirect equity interest represented by the number of shares of common stock which it then owns (directly and indirectly), liberty hsn or its permitted transferee will exchange its shares of home shopping common stock and its home shopping class b common stock for the liberty exchange shares. as a consequence of the issuance of shares to mr. allen pursuant to the stock exchange agreement, under applicable fcc regulations and interpretations (including the march order), liberty hsn was permitted to hold an indirect equity interest in a greater number of shares of the company than it held immediately prior to the issuance of the allen shares. in accordance with the terms of the contingent rights held by liberty hsn, 2,002,591 contingent rights shares were issued to liberty hsn immediately following the issuance of the allen shares. the contingent rights shares issued to liberty hsn were contributed to bdtv iii, a newly formed entity in which mr. diller owns all of the voting equity interests and tci owns a non-voting equity interest (which non-voting interest constitutes substantially all the equity of such entities) and which (other than with respect to certain fundamental corporate actions) is controlled by mr. diller, in accordance with the terms of the stockholders agreement. in addition, as previously reported, the stock exchange agreement provides that, depending upon the market price of the common stock, in july 1998 up to 3,257,328 additional shares of common stock may be required to be issued to mr. allen. accordingly, in the event additional shares of common stock become issuable to mr. allen pursuant to the stock exchange agreement in july 1998, additional contingent rights shares, or if the contingent rights have theretofore been terminated through the prior issuance of all contingent rights shares, liberty exchange shares will become issuable to liberty hsn. assuming the maximum of 3,257,328 of such additional shares were issued to mr. allen and that no additional contingent rights shares are issued to liberty hsn prior to july 1998, the remaining 589,161 contingent rights shares and 296,113 liberty exchange shares would be issued to liberty hsn. page 10 of _ pages signature after reasonable inquiry and to the best of his knowledge and belief, each of the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in

corporation, any certificate for shares surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the corporation, duly executed by the holder of such shares or the duly authorized representative of such holder. promptly thereafter, the corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder or such holder's nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of class a common stock to which such holder shall be entitled as herein provided. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of

threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the general corporation law of the state of delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and excise taxes or penalties arising under the employee retirement income security act of 1974) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrator; provided, however, that, except -------- ------- as provided in paragraph 2(b), the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the designated holder. the right to indemnification conferred in this paragraph 2 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the general -------- ------- corporation law of the state of delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, which undertaking shall itself be sufficient without the need for further evaluation of the creditworthiness of the undertaking or of such advancement, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this paragraph 2 or otherwise. notwithstanding the foregoing, no director or officer of the corporation shall be deemed to be serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of hsni or any entity controlled by, controlling or under common control (other than the corporation) with hsni (including employee benefit plans) (collectively, "the hsni entities"). (b) right of claimant to bring suit. if a claim under paragraph ------------------------------- 2(a) is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the 8 corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim, unless the failure to have been so paid is the result of any action or failure to act on the part of such claimant. it shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the general corporation law of the state of delaware for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. neither the failure of the corporation (including its board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the general corporation law of the state of delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. (c) non-exclusivity of rights. the right to indemnification and ------------------------- the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this paragraph 2 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. (d) insurance. the corporation may maintain insurance, at its --------- expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the general corporation law of the state of delaware. (e) set-off of indemnification remedies; subrogation. in the ------------------------------------------------ case of a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses against the corporation under this paragraph 2 arising out of acts, events or circumstances for which the claimant, who was at the relevant time serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of any of the hsni entities, may be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to such hsni entity's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, insurance policy or a contractual agreement between the claimant and such entity (a "hsni indemnity provision"), the claimant seeking indemnification hereunder shall first seek indemnification and advancement of expenses pursuant to any such hsni indemnity provision. to the extent that amounts to be indemnified or advanced to a claimant hereunder are paid or advanced by or on behalf of a hsni entity, the claimant's right to indemnification and advancement of expenses hereunder shall be reduced. in the event of any payment of indemnification or 9 advancement of expenses pursuant to this paragraph 2 by the corporation, the corporation shall be subrogated to any such rights the applicable claimant may have to indemnification from or on behalf of any of the hsni entities in connection with the acts, events or circumstances giving rise to such claim. article viii term the term of existence of this corporation shall be perpetual. article ix stock not assessable the capital stock of this corporation shall not be assessable. it shall be issued as fully paid, and the private property of the stockholders shall not be liable for the debts, obligations or liabilities of this corporation. article x meetings of stockholders except as otherwise prescribed by law or by another provision of this certificate, special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation, for any purpose or purposes, shall be called by the secretary of the corporation (i) upon the written request of the holders of not less than a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding common stock, (ii) at any time following the occurrence of a conversion event or following notice to the corporation of the execution of an agreement to transfer, upon the written request of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of class b common stock, (iii) at the request of at least a majority of the members of the board of directors then in office or (iv) at the request of the chairman of the board, if there be one. the holders of the class b common stock shall be given notice of and shall be entitled to attend all annual and special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation. 10 article xi action by written consent of stockholders; action by the board of directors except as otherwise prescribed by law or by another provision of this certificate, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, shall be signed by the holder or holders of shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted. 11 in witness whereof, the undersigned has signed this certificate of incorporation this 16th day of july, 1997. ____________________________________ elizabeth crutcher incorporator 12 -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
