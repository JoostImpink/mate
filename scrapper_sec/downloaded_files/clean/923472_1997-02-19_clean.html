(c) distributions with respect to unexchanged shares. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the effective time with respect to shares of parent common stock with a record date after the effective 8 17 time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate with respect to the shares of parent common stock which such holder is entitled to receive, and no cash consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder of such certificate shall surrender such certificate for exchange as provided herein. subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates evidencing whole shares of parent common stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable following such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 2.3(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time theretofore payable (and not paid) with respect to such whole shares of parent common stock, in each case less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of parent common stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon. (d) no further rights in company common stock. the shares of parent common stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of company common stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been made in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of company common stock, subject, however, to the surviving corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the effective time which may have been declared or made by the company on such shares of company common stock in accordance with the terms of this agreement or prior to the date hereof and that remain unpaid at the effective time. (e) no fractional shares. no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of parent common stock shall be issued in connection with the merger, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of the parent. in lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of company common stock upon surrender of a certificate for exchange pursuant to this section 2.3 shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the final parent stock price by (ii) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all 9 18 shares of company common stock then held of record by such holder). (f) termination of exchange fund. any portion of the exchange fund which remains undistributed to the holders of company common stock as of the date which is twelve months after the effective time shall be delivered to the parent, upon demand, and any holders of company common stock who have not theretofore complied with this article ii shall thereafter look only to the parent (as unsecured general creditors thereof) for payment of the merger consideration, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends or distributions with respect to parent common stock, to which they are entitled pursuant hereto. (g) no liability. neither the parent nor the surviving corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of company common stock for any cash, stock or other property delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (h) withholding rights. the parent or the exchange agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of shares of company common stock such amounts as the parent or the exchange agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the "code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. to the extent that amounts are so withheld by the parent or the exchange agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of company common stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the parent or the exchange agent. (i) lost certificates. in the event that any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the exchange agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the merger consideration, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends or distributions with respect to stock consideration, to which they are entitled pursuant hereto. 10 19 section 2.4. stock transfer books. from and after the effective time, the stock transfer books of the company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of company common stock on the books and records of the company or the surviving corporation. if, after the effective time, any certificates are presented to the exchange agent or the surviving corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this article ii. section 2.5. stock options. at the effective time, each company option (as defined below) outstanding immediately prior thereto shall be converted into and represent the right to receive (a) the merger consideration into which the share or shares of company common stock issuable upon exercise of such company option would have been converted if such company option had been exercised immediately prior to the effective time, reduced by (b) (i) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of company common stock then issuable upon exercise of such company option and (ii) the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon (such reductions to be applied on a pro rata basis against the cash consideration and the stock consideration comprising such merger consideration, in the respective proportions which such cash consideration and stock consideration bear to such merger consideration). all such company options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and each option certificate shall thereafter represent the right to receive, upon surrender of such option certificate in accordance with section 2.3, the merger consideration into which such company options have been converted in accordance herewith. the holders of option certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as required by law. no fractional share of parent common stock shall be issued and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in section 2.3(e) with respect to exchanges of stock certificates. no interest will be paid or will accrue on any merger consideration (except as specified in section 2.1(a)(i)), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock or any unpaid dividends or distributions in respect of parent common stock payable upon surrender of option certificates pursuant to this article ii. from and after the date of this agreement, the company shall not permit any additional options to purchase shares of company common stock to be issued or granted under the company's stock option plans or otherwise. section 2.6. dissenting shares. (a) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to the 11 20 contrary, shares of company common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and which are held by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with section 262 of the dgcl and shall not have failed to perfect or shall not have effectively withdrawn such demand or otherwise lost their appraisal rights (the "dissenting shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive merger consideration. such stockholders shall be entitled to have such shares of company common stock held by them appraised in accordance with the provisions of section 262 of the dgcl, except that all dissenting shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost their right to appraisal of such shares of company common stock under such section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the effective time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the merger consideration therefor, upon surrender in accordance with section 2.3 of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of company common stock.

original agreement and the first amendment, and the parties hereto other than the rl partnership. capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the original agreement, as amended by the first amendment and the second amendment (as so amended, the "existing agreement"). 2 background a. cpphus has sold all eligible securities beneficially owned by it. b. the rl partnership owns of record and beneficially 20,900,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of red lion hotels, inc., a delaware corporation ("red
