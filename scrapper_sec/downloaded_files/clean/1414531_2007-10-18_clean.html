sources and amount of funds or other consideration. on october 8, 2007, pursuant to the subscription and support agreement (the &#147;support agreement&#148;) between hexagon and novatel, hexagon agreed to acquire an aggregate amount of 953,864 shares of novatel and a u.s.$38,202,250 principal amount, 4.0% senior unsecured debenture convertible into 764,045 shares, subject to adjustment (the &#147;convertible debenture&#148;), at a purchase price of u.s.$50.00 per share (collectively, the &#147;private placement&#148;). the support agreement is further described in item 6. the private placement was consummated on october 17, 2007. the aggregate consideration paid by hexagon to novatel in connection with the private placement was u.s.$85,895,450. hexagon funded the private placement by using available cash on hand. item 4:&#160;&#160; purpose of transaction. on october 8, 2007, in connection with the acquisition of the shares under the private placement, hexagon and novatel entered into the support agreement pursuant to which hexagon, by itself or through a subsidiary (the &#147;offeror&#148;), agreed to commence a tender offer (the &#147;offer&#148;) for all of the issued and outstanding shares together with shares issuable upon exercise of options or any right to acquire shares (&#147;options&#148;) at a purchase price of u.s.$50.00 in cash per share. the purpose of the offer is to acquire all of the shares. hexagon agreed to make the offer because hexagon wants to acquire control of, and ultimately be in a position to acquire all of the shares. 3 in order to induce the parties to enter into the transaction and ensure that hexagon will have a continued interest in novatel and to allow for the better alignment of interests between novatel and its most significant customer, leica geosystems, ag, a wholly-owned subsidiary of hexagon, the parties structured the transaction in the form of an offer coupled with a private placement. if all the conditions of the offer are satisfied or waived by the offeror, as soon as the offeror takes up and pays for the shares pursuant to the offer, novatel has agreed to enable hexagon to appoint all of novatel&#146;s directors. if, within 120 days after the date of the offer, novatel shareholders that hold not less than 90% of the shares (calculated on a fully-diluted basis), other than shares held by hexagon or one of hexagon&#146;s affiliates or associates, have accepted the offer and hexagon acquires the deposited shares, then hesagon currently intends and is obligated under the terms of the support agreement, subject to certain conditions thereunder, to acquire the shares not deposited under the offer on the same terms as the shares acquired under the offer in a compulsory acquisition. if hexagon accepts and pays for the shares validly deposited under the offer and a compulsory acquisition is not available or hexagon elects not to proceed with a compulsory acquisition subject to the terms of the support agreement, hexagon currently intends to take the necessary action, including causing a meeting of novatel shareholders to be held, to consider a subsequent acquisition transaction involving novatel and hexagon or an affiliate of hexagon, for the purpose of enabling hexagon or an affiliate of hexagon to acquire all shares not acquired under the offer. if, as a result of the offer and any subsequent transaction, the number of novatel shareholders is sufficiently reduced, to the extent permitted by applicable law, hexagon intends to take certain measures, including, potentially delisting the shares from the nasdaq global select market and to cause novatel to cease to be a public company. item 5:&#160;&#160; interest in securities of the issuer. (a) as a result of the private placement, hexagon is the beneficial owner of 953,864 shares acquired upon the closing of the private placement on october 17, 2007 and will be the beneficial owner of 764,054 (subject to adjustment) shares issuable upon the conversion of the convertible debenture, representing in the aggregate 1,717,909 shares or 16.6% of the issued and outstanding shares after giving effect to the number of shares issued and issuable to hexagon in the private placement. consummation of the private placement was subject to approval by nasdaq of the transaction, which was obtained on october 12, 2007. pursuant to its terms, the convertible debenture may not be converted into shares prior to january 15, 2008. (b) with regards to such shares, hexagon has the sole power to vote and the sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of 953,864 shares.&#160; in addition, upon the conversion of the convertible debenture, hexagon shall have the sole power to vote and the sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of an additional 764,045 shares issuable pursuant to the convertible debenture. the responses to items 6 and 7 of this schedule 13d are incorporated herein by reference.

(i) waive, in whole or in part, any term or condition of the offer for its benefit provided that if the offeror takes up and pays for any shares, it shall acquire not less than the minimum required shares (as defined in the support agreement); and (ii) amend or change any term or condition of the offer, except that, without the prior written consent of novatel, the offeror shall not (a) reduce the offer price; (b) change the form of consideration payable under the offer; (c) add to, amend or change any term or condition in a manner that is materially adverse to the shareholders in aggregate; (d) impose additional conditions to the offer; and (e) change the minimum required shares to less than 50.1% of the outstanding shares or to greater than 66&#8532;% of the 6 outstanding shares, in each case exclusive of shares held by hexagon or its affiliates;

or (iv) accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement an acquisition proposal; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of the support agreement, novatel and the officers, directors, advisors and other representatives of novatel may: (a) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; enter into, or participate in, any discussions or negotiations with a third party who seeks to initiate (without solicitation or encouragement) such discussions or negotiations and, may furnish to such third party information concerning novatel and its business, properties and assets, in each case if, and only to the extent that: (i) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the third party has first made an acquisition proposal which the board of directors has determined, in good faith and acting reasonably, if pursued would be reasonably likely to constitute a superior proposal and after receiving the advice of outside counsel has determined that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach by the members of the board of directors of their fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable law; and (ii) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; prior to furnishing such information to or entering into or participating in any such discussions or negotiations with such third party, novatel provides prompt notice to the offeror to the effect that it is furnishing information to or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with such third party and if not previously provided to the offeror, copies of all information provided to such third party concurrently with the provision of such information to such third party; provided that this paragraph (a) shall cease to apply after the expiry of four business days from the time such third party made the acquisition proposal referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) above, unless within such four business day period the board of directors determines that the acquisition proposal is a superior proposal (as defined in the support agreement) and after receiving the advice of outside counsel has 7 determined that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach by the members of the board of directors of their fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable law; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; subject to paragraphs (a) and (c), comply with applicable securities laws relating to the provision of directors&#146; circulars and making appropriate disclosure with respect thereto to shareholders; and (c) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; withdraw, modify, qualify or change any of its recommendations or determinations referred to above under &#147;approval by novatel directors&#148; in a manner adverse to the offeror or resolve to do so or accept, recommend, approve or implement any superior proposal if novatel has complied with the terms of the support agreement in respect of the superior proposal and prior to such acceptance, recommendation, approval or implementation: (i) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; after consultation with its financial advisors, and after receiving advice of outside counsel the board of directors concludes in good faith such action is necessary for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; (ii) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
