agreement making a proposal to acquire battle mountain accepted february 28, 2007 (the &#147;letter agreement&#148;), which provides, among other things, for an exclusive 45 day period for royal gold and battle mountain to negotiate definitive documentation (the &#147;definitive documentation&#148;) for the acquisition of 100% of the common stock of battle mountain by royal gold for 1,570,507

is in competition or inconsistent with the acquisition or the definitive documentation, relates to a competing transaction or that could otherwise prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the

may be expected to lead to a competing transaction and to advise royal gold of any such inquiries or proposals of which such stockholder becomes aware. in addition, each stockholder agrees that it will not (i) tender into any tender or exchange offer or otherwise directly or indirectly transfer its common stock or (ii) grant any proxies with respect to such common stock, deposit such common stock into a voting trust, enter into a voting agreement with respect to such common stock or otherwise restrict the ability of such stockholder freely to exercise all voting rights with respect to such common stock. the voting and transfer restrictions on iamgold will terminate in the event royal gold has been notified of a written and publicly announced acquisition proposal that the board of directors of battle mountain concludes is more favorable to battle mountain&#146;s shareholders than the acquisition or a written offer pursuant to which iamgold will receive a per share purchase price at least 7.5% higher than the per share consideration specified in the letter agreement or definitive documentation (a &#147;superior proposal&#148;). pursuant to the support agreement with

and (iii) the highest price paid by royal gold to any other shareholder of battle mountain at any time during the ninety days prior to the date that the shareholders of battle mountain approve the acquisition and the definitive documentation. royal gold&#146;s option to purchase iamgold&#146;s shares will terminate, unless previously exercised, upon the earlier of (i) september 5, 2007, (ii) five business days after royal gold is notified of a superior proposal and (iii) the date on which the support agreement with iamgold terminates. page 5 of 9 the support agreement with kucher will

documentation, provided however, royal gold&#146;s option to purchase kucher&#146;s shares will survive until the twelve month anniversary of the date of the support agreement. the support agreement
