pursuant to the terms of the combination agreement. subject to the terms of the stockholder agreement, ses and steag currently intend to hold the shares of mattson stock for investment purposes. the stockholder agreement provides that, until termination of such agreement, mattson's board of directors will consist of seven members, two of whom are to be designated by ses, one of whom is to be the chief executive officer of mattson, and (subject to certain exceptions) the remaining four of whom will be independent directors (as defined in the stockholder agreement). pursuant to the stockholder agreement, effective as of the closing of the business combination, mattson caused (i) dr. jochen melchior and dr. hans-georg betz, as designees of ses, to become members of the expanded board of directors and (ii) dr. melchior to be appointed as chairman of the board for a term of one year. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, a nominating committee of the board of directors has been established to propose nominees to succeed any independent director or to fill any other vacancies not otherwise provided for in the stockholder agreement. in addition, mattson's board of directors has established an executive staffing committee consisting initially of dr. melchior and mr. mattson to make key personnel decisions. as required by the stockholder agreement, mattson's bylaws have been amended and restated in accordance with the stockholder agreement in a manner consistent with the foregoing arrangements. under the stockholder agreement, ses has agreed that, prior to the earlier of the termination of the agreement or the expiration of five years following the closing of the business combination (the "standstill period"), neither ses nor any of its majority-owned and controlled affiliates will acquire or make an offer to acquire any additional shares of mattson's voting stock unless (i) prior disinterested director approval (as defined in the stockholder agreement) of such acquisition has been obtained, (ii) the acquisition is necessary to maintain ses's aggregate percentage ownership of mattson's outstanding voting stock, (iii) the acquisition is pursuant to a stock issuance by mattson in respect of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar corporate transaction or (iv) the acquisition is a transfer of voting stock between ses and an affiliate that has agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the stockholder agreement. under the terms of the stockholder agreement, ses is also prohibited, during the standstill period, from (i) soliciting or participating in a solicitation of proxies for mattson's voting stock (except in connection with the election of directors), (ii) making any public announcement regarding any acquisition proposal (as defined in the stockholder agreement) not approved by mattson's board of directors, (iii) depositing any shares of voting stock in a voting trust or similar arrangement with any person other than mattson or a person within ses's control group or (iv) forming or joining any group with any person other than persons within ses's control group for the purpose of voting, holding, purchasing or disposing of mattson's voting stock. the foregoing "standstill" restrictions will be suspended in the event an unrelated person or group, without prior approval of the board of directors of mattson, (i) commences a tender offer, (ii) acquires voting stock of mattson resulting in beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the then-outstanding voting stock or (iii) acquires beneficial ownership of more than 10% of the then-outstanding voting stock and commences or publicly announces its intention to seek a change of control (as defined in the stockholder agreement). the stockholder agreement also provides that, prior to any sale or issuance by mattson of any shares of its voting stock, ses will have a preemptive right to purchase its proportionate share of such voting stock on terms at least as favorable to ses as the terms on which mattson proposes to sell such stock to any other party. this preemptive right is subject to certain exceptions, including (i) issuances of voting stock to employees, officers, directors and consultants pursuant to any stock option plan or agreement, (ii) issuances of voting stock in connection with certain mergers, consolidations, share exchanges or other reorganizations and (iii) issuances of limited amounts of voting stock in connection with equipment financings, technology licensing, research and development agreements or asset acquisitions approved by mattson's board of directors. ses's preemptive right will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the closing of any acquisition transaction (as defined in the stockholder agreement) resulting in a change of control of mattson, (ii) the sale of all or substantially all of mattson's assets and (iii) the termination of the stockholder agreement in accordance with its terms. under the stockholder agreement, ses has also agreed not to transfer or dispose of any shares of mattson's voting stock for a period of one year following the closing of the business combination, except for transfers made following disinterested director approval and transfers to affiliates of ses. in addition, ses has agreed that, following the one-year lockup period, it will not transfer or dispose of any shares of mattson's voting stock without first giving mattson an opportunity to purchase the shares, unless such transfer or disposition by ses is made (i) pursuant to a bona fide public offering, (ii) pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act") or (iii) to an affiliate of ses. furthermore, ses has agreed not to sell or transfer more than 2.4 million shares of mattson voting stock (subject to adjustment) to a person or group following the one-year lockup period, except (i) pursuant to the exceptions to mattson's right of first refusal described above, (ii) pursuant to a change of control transaction that has received either disinterested director approval or majority stockholder approval (excluding ses), (iii) after the third anniversary of the closing of the business combination or (iv) during suspension of the "standstill" provisions as described above. ses also has the right under the stockholder agreement following the expiration of the one-year lockup period to include its shares of mattson stock in a registration of common stock effected by mattson under the securities act and to request registration of its shares of mattson stock on form s-3 under the securities act once every 12 months, subject to customary provisions regarding expenses, indemnification, reporting under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, assignment, market "stand-off" agreements, termination of registration rights and limitations on subsequent registration rights. the stockholder agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) ses owning less than 20% of mattson's outstanding voting stock, (ii) ses owning 50% or more of mattson's outstanding voting stock and (iii) a material breach by mattson of any material obligation under the stockholder agreement. all references to, and summaries of, the stockholder agreement in this item

june 27, 2000, is entered into by and among steag electronic systems ag, an aktiengesellschaft organized and existing under the laws of the federal republic of germany ("steag"), and mattson

and outstanding capital stock, equity ownership or its equivalent (which, for purposes of this agreement, shall be referred to as "capital stock") (the "stock acquisition") of the steag subsidiaries listed on exhibit a to this agreement and steag electronic systems semiconductor gmbh, a gesellschaft mit beschraenkter haftung recently organized in connection with this agreement and existing under the laws of the federal republic of germany ("newco") (collectively with the subsidiaries listed on exhibit a, the "steag subsidiaries"). b. prior to the closing (as defined below), steag will contribute, assign or otherwise transfer all of the capital stock it owns directly in of each of those steag subsidiaries incorporated or organized in jurisdictions other than the u.s.a. and germany to newco, and at steag's option, steag may also contribute, assign or otherwise transfer to newco all of the capital stock steag owns directly in of each of those steag subsidiaries incorporated in the u.s.a.

will own 100% of the capital stock of newco. c. to effect the stock acquisition, at the closing, steag will sell, assign and transfer to mattson 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of newco, each of the other steag subsidiaries incorporated or organized in germany and each of the steag subsidiaries incorporated in the u.s.a. that steag owns directly and does not contribute or

under any such material contract and, to mattson's knowledge, no other party thereto is in default except as would not reasonably be expected to have a mattson material adverse effect. to mattson's knowledge, nothing has occurred which, with or without the passage of time or giving of notice or both, would constitute a default by mattson or any mattson subsidiary or by any other party under any

material contract is not likely to be renewed. the strategic business combination contemplated by this agreement will not create a default under or permit the termination of or otherwise adversely

part of any customer, insurance company or service provider with which mattson or mattson subsidiaries transact business to timely remedy their own deficiencies in respect of the year 2000 problem, which inability, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a mattson material adverse effect. 4.19 brokers and finders. except for alliant partners, neither mattson nor any officer, director, or employee of mattson has employed any brokers, finder or investment banker or incurred any liability for any brokerage or investment banking fees, commissions or finders' fees

(c) if the indemnification claim involves a third party claim, then the procedures set forth in section 9.3 hereof shall be observed by indemnitee and indemnitor. (d) if the indemnification claim involves a matter other than a third party claim (as defined below), indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days to object to such indemnification claim by delivery of a written notice of such objection to indemnitee specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection. failure to timely so object shall constitute a final and binding acceptance of the indemnification claim by indemnitor, and the indemnification claim shall thereafter be paid by indemnitor in accordance with section 9.2(e) hereof. if an objection is timely delivered by indemnitor and the dispute is not resolved within twenty (20) business days from the delivery of such objection (the "negotiation period"), the parties shall be entitled to pursue their remedies at law and in equity subject to the terms of this agreement. (e) upon determination of the amount of an indemnification claim, whether by (i) an agreement between indemnitor and indemnitee, (ii) an arbitration award or (iii) a final judgment (after expiration of all periods for appeal of such judgment) or other final nonappealable order, indemnitor shall pay the amount of such indemnification claim by check within ten (10) days of the date such amount is determined. 9.3 defense of third party claims. should any claim be made, or suit or proceeding (including, without limitation, a binding arbitration or an audit by any taxing authority) be instituted against indemnitee which, if prosecuted successfully, would be a matter for which indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this agreement (a "third party claim"), the obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder with respect to such third party claim shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) indemnitee shall give indemnitor written notice of any such claim promptly after receipt by indemnitee of notice thereof. any delay in giving notice hereunder which does not materially prejudice indemnitor, shall not affect indemnitee's rights to indemnification hereunder. indemnitor may, at its option, (i) undertake control of the defense thereof by counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to indemnitee, or (ii) decline to assume control of but participate in the defense thereof provided that such participation by indemnitee shall be at its own expense. indemnitee may participate in the defense through its own counsel at its own expense. the assumption of the defense of any third party claim by indemnitor shall be an acknowledgment by indemnitor that such third party claim is subject to indemnification under the provisions of this article ix and that such provisions are binding on indemnitor. if, however, indemnitor fails or refuses to undertake the defense of such third party claim within twenty (20) days after written notice of such claim has been delivered to indemnitor by indemnitee, indemnitee shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise and, subject to section 9.4, settlement of such third party claim with counsel of its own choosing. in the circumstances described in the preceding sentence, indemnitee shall, promptly upon its assumption of the defense of such third party claim, make an indemnification claim as specified in section 9.2(b) which shall be deemed an indemnification claim that is not a third party claim for the purposes of the procedures set forth herein. failure of indemnitee to furnish written notice to indemnitor of a third party claim shall not release indemnitor from indemnitor's obligations hereunder, except to the extent indemnitor is prejudiced by such failure. (b) indemnitee and indemnitor shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any third party claim, including making available records relating to such claim and furnishing employees of indemnitee as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of any such third party claim or for testimony as witness in any proceeding relating to such claim. 9.4 settlement of third party claims. unless indemnitor has failed to fulfill its obligations under this article ix, no settlement by indemnitee of a third party claim shall be made without the prior written consent by or on behalf of indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. if indemnitor has assumed the defense of a third party claim as contemplated by section 9.3, no settlement of such third party claim may be made by indemnitor without the prior written consent by or on behalf of indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. in the event of any dispute regarding the reasonableness of a proposed settlement, the party that will bear the larger financial loss resulting from such settlement shall make the final determination in respect thereto, which determination shall be final and binding on all involved parties. 9.5 limitation on indemnification. notwithstanding anything contained in this article ix

(c) subject to the provisions of section 5.3(b) above, the company shall be entitled to include in any registration statement referred to in this section 5.3, for sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified by the requesting holders, shares of common stock to be sold by the company for its own account, except as and to the extent that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter (if such method of disposition shall be an underwritten public offering), such inclusion would adversely affect the marketing of the registrable securities to be sold. except for registration statements on form s-4, form s-8 or any successor forms thereto, the company will not file with the commission any other registration statement under the act with respect to its common stock, whether for its own account or that of other stockholders, from the date of receipt of a notice from requesting holders pursuant to this section 5.3 until the completion of the period of distribution of the registration contemplated thereby. 5.4 obligations of the company. whenever required under this agreement to effect the registration of any registrable securities, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities within 45 days after receipt of requisite requests from holders for registration and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and, upon the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for the period of the distribution contemplated thereby (determined as hereinafter provided);

provided that, if the company reasonably determines, following consultation with its outside counsel, that such a supplement or amendment would require disclosure of material information and such disclosure would be materially detrimental to the company, then upon written notice to participating holders to that effect, each holder shall suspend any sales or trades of the company's securities under any registration statement for so long as the company determines such disclosure is required and materially detrimental, but in any case not longer than thirty (30) days immediately following such notice; (g) cause all such registrable securities registered pursuant to this agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or national market system on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed or traded;

(i) make available upon reasonable notice for inspection by each seller of registrable securities, any underwriter participating in any distribution pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by such seller of registrable securities or underwriter, all pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the company, and cause the company's officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with preparation and verification of such registration statement; (j) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the sec, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve months, but not more than eighteen (18) months, beginning with the first month after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act; and (k) take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the sale of such registrable securities, including, without limitation, causing management of the company to participate in "road show" presentations. for purposes of sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), the period of distribution of registrable securities in a firm commitment underwritten public offering shall be deemed to extend until each underwriter has completed the distribution of all securities purchased by it, and the period of distribution of common stock in any other registration shall be deemed to extend until the earlier of the sale of all common stock covered thereby or 120 days after the effective date thereof. 5.5 provision of information. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to this section 5 that the selling holders shall furnish to the company such information regarding themselves, the registrable securities held by them and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of the registrable securities. 5.6 expenses of registration. all expenses other than underwriting discounts and commissions incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications of registrable securities pursuant to sections 5.2 and 5.3, including (without limitation) all registration, filing and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the participating holders, shall be borne by the company. 5.7 indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under this agreement: (a) to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder of such registrable securities, the officers and directors of each such holder, any underwriter (as defined in the securities act) for such holder and each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively, a "violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the securities act, the exchange act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the exchange act or any state securities law; and the company will reimburse each such holder, officer or director, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 5.7(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such holder, officer, director, underwriter or controlling person. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter and any other holder selling securities in such registration statement or any of its directors or officers or any person who controls such holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter, or other such holder or director, officer, controlling person or underwriter may become subject, under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter, or other such holder or director, officer, controlling person or underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 5.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder from whom indemnification is sought (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this section 5.7(b) exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 5.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 5.7, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, shall only relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 5.7 if and to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such omission, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 5.7. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation against an indemnified party, shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation, unless such indemnified party shall otherwise consent in writing. (d) in order to provide for just and equitable contributions in any case in which either (i) any holder exercising registration rights under sections 5.2 or 5.3 of this agreement, or any controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this section 5.7 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and following the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case, notwithstanding the fact that this section 5.7 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the act may be required on the part of any such holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this section 5.7; then, and in each such case, the company and such holder shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect both the relative benefit received by such holder and the relative fault of the company and such holder; provided, however, that, in any such case, (a) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such selling holder from the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement; and (b) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. for purposes of the preceding sentence, the relative benefit received by such holder shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the public offering price of its registrable securities offered by the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by such registration statement; and the relative fault of the company and such holder shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission of a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or by such holder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) the obligations of the company and holders under this section 5.7 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement, the termination of this agreement pursuant to section 7 hereof and otherwise. 5.8 reports under the exchange act. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144 under the securities act and any other rule or regulation of the commission that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the company to the public without registration, the company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144, at all times; (b) file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act; and (c) furnish to any holder, so long as the holder owns any registrable securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of rule 144, the securities act and the exchange act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company and such other reports and documents so filed by the company and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any holder of any rule or regulation of the commission which permits the selling of any such securities without registration. 5.9 assignment of registration rights. the rights to cause the company to register registrable securities pursuant to this agreement may be assigned by a holder; provided, that within a reasonable time after such transfer, the company is furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned; and provided, further, that such assignment shall be effective only if immediately following such transfer the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the securities act. any assignee or transferee asserting rights under this agreement shall be deemed to have consented to the terms and conditions hereof. notwithstanding the foregoing, holders' rights to cause the company to register their registrable securities and to keep information available, granted to them by the company under this section 5, may be assigned (or assigned in part and retained in part) to one or more transferees or assignees who either (x) are affiliates of stockholder or (y) receive registrable securities which, upon full exercise and conversion, represent the right to obtain at least five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of registrable securities (as adjusted for stock dividends, stock split, recapitalizations and the like that occur after the date of this agreement), provided, that (i) the company is given written notice by such holder at the time of or within a reasonable time after said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of said transferee or assignee and identifying the securities with respect to which such rights are being assigned, and (ii) upon request by the company, such permitted transferee or assignee executes a counterpart to section 5 of this agreement. 5.10 "market stand-off" agreement. each holder hereby agrees that it shall not, to the extent requested by the company and an underwriter of common stock (or other securities) of the company, sell, make short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of or otherwise transfer or dispose (other than to donees who agree to be similarly bound) of any registrable securities for a period of time, as agreed to by the company and the underwriter not to exceed ninety (90) days, following the effective date of a registration statement of the company filed under the securities act for an offering in which the holder participates; provided, however, that all officers and directors of the company and all other persons with registration rights (whether or not pursuant to this agreement) except passive, outside investors enter into similar agreements. 5.11 termination of registration rights. the company's obligations pursuant to this section 5 shall terminate as to any holder of registrable securities when the holder can sell all of such holder's registrable securities pursuant to rule 144(k) under the securities act and shall be suspended, but not terminated, during any three-month period in which such holder is entitled to sell all shares issued or issuable to such holder under rule 144. this section 5 shall expressly survive termination of this agreement pursuant to section 7 hereto. 5.12 no inconsistent agreements. the company shall not, on or after the date of this agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the stockholder and other holders in this section 5 or otherwise conflicts with the provisions of this section 5. the company represents and warrants to stockholder that the rights granted to the holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with any registration rights granted to any holders of the company's securities. 5.13 limitations on subsequent registration rights. from and after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of stockholder, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company giving such holder or prospective holder any registration rights, other than registration rights which are no more favorable (in terms of rights and limitations) than those granted to stockholder hereunder and under which the rights of such third party holder or prospective holder to include securities in such registration are subordinate to the right of holders to include registrable securities therein; provided however that the company may grant registration rights which are equivalent in priority to the registration rights granted hereunder to recipients of voting stock issued by the company in connection with a transaction of the type described in rule 145(a) under the securities act or a share exchange in which the company is the acquiring corporation. 6. notice of voting stock transfers by mattson. 6.1 general. except as otherwise provided in section 6.2, ten (10) business days prior to any sale or transfer of, or entering into any agreement to sell or transfer, voting stock by mattson (other than a sale or transfer that would satisfy section 4.2(i) or (ii) if such sale or transfer were made by stockholder), mattson shall provide stockholder written notice stating: (i) the number of shares of voting stock to be sold or transferred; (ii) the name, address and relationship to mattson, if any, of the purchaser or transferee; and (iii) the cash price or other consideration per share for which the voting stock is to be sold or transferred. 6.2 exceptions. section 6.1 shall not apply to any of the following sales or transfers of voting stock by mattson: (a) any transfer to mattson's spouse, lineal descendant or antecedent, father, mother, brother or sister, the adopted child or adopted grandchild of mattson, or the spouse of any child, adopted child, grandchild or adopted grandchild of mattson, or to a trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of mattson or his family members as described in this section 6.2(a), transfers from mattson by devise or descent, or transfers by way of any pledge by mattson;

termination. 7.1 effectiveness. this agreement shall become effective upon the closing of the steag transaction as contemplated by the combination agreement (the "effective date") and prior thereto shall be of no force or effect. if the combination agreement shall be terminated in accordance with its terms, this agreement shall automatically be deemed to have been terminated and shall thereafter be of no force or effect. 7.2 termination. except with respect to the rights and obligations set forth in section 5 which by their terms expressly survive until terminated pursuant to section 5.11 and the general provision set forth in section 8, all rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities of the parties under this agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (a) stockholder's beneficial ownership of voting stock constituting less than twenty percent (20%) of the then-outstanding voting stock; (b) stockholder's beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the then-outstanding voting stock other than as a result of stockholder's violation of section 2 of this agreement; or (c) a material breach by the company of any of its material obligations under this agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, a good faith disagreement with respect to the company's indemnification obligations under section 5.7, or the failure by the company to timely satisfy a notice or filing obligation under sections 2.6, 3.1, 5.3, 5.4(a) or 5.8, if such notice or filing is ultimately made by the company not more than thirty (30) days after the date prescribed therefor, shall not result in termination of the parties' rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities under this section 7.2(c); provided, that nothing contained in this section 7.2(c) shall limit any rights stockholder may have to damages or other remedies, whether at law or in equity, as a result of any of the breaches described in this section 7.2(c). 8. miscellaneous. 8.1 other agreements superseded. this agreement supersedes all prior agreements or understandings written or oral between the parties hereto, relating to the subject matter hereof, and incorporates the entire understanding of the parties with respect thereto. 8.2 amendment or modification;
