(a) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, either shareholder may, at any time following notice to the other shareholder, transfer any of his or her shares or any interest therein to (i) an entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by such shareholder or an affiliate of such shareholder, (ii) his or her spouse, children, grandchildren or parents or a trust solely for the benefit of any such person or persons or (iii) to any other person not mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) of this section 1.2(a) as long as the aggregate of all such transfers made by either shareholder pursuant to this clause (iii) does not exceed 10% of the number of shares of common stock owned by such shareholder as of the date of this agreement, in each case without the consent of any other party hereto and without first offering such shares to any other party; provided, however, that such transfer must be in full compliance with the act, all applicable state securities laws. every transfer of shares by a shareholder pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph shall be subject to the condition that the proposed transferee, if not already bound by this agreement, shall first agree in writing, in form satisfactory to the company, to be bound by the terms hereof. in addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, shares of common stock, convertible preferred stock or other capital stock or equity securities of the company acquired by either shareholder after the date of this agreement (other than through the exercise of options or warrants or through the conversion of convertible securities outstanding as of the date hereof and other than shares received as a result of stock splits or stock dividends) shall not be subject to any of the provisions of article i of this agreement. 1.3. first negotiation rights. subject to sections 1.4 and 1.5, following the expiration of the two-year period after the date of this agreement, a shareholder may transfer any or all shares (or any interest therein) owned by it free and clear of all restrictions and other obligations imposed by this agreement provided such shareholder first complies with section 1.3. if any shareholder (for purposes of this section 1.3, the "offering party") desires to transfer all or any portion of the shares (or any interest therein) held by such offering party, the offering party shall deliver written notice to the other parties hereto (the "notice"), which notice shall state the number of shares (or interest therein) which the offering party owns and wishes to sell (the "offered shares"). by giving the notice, the offering party shall be deemed to have granted to the other parties hereto an option to negotiate for the purchase of all of (but not less than all of) such shares at a price to be negotiated and agreed to (the "negotiated price") by the offering party and such other shareholder for a 30-day period following the date of the notice. 1.4. take-along rights. (a) notwithstanding section 1.3 of this agreement, neither shareholder may effect a transfer (or a series of related transfers) of shares (except for transfers permitted by section 1.2) constituting more than 50% of the shares then owned by such shareholder to one person or a related group of persons (other than transfers effected by sales of shares through underwriters in a public offering or in the securities markets generally) (the "section 1.4 shares") without first complying with this section 1.4. if either shareholder (for purposes of this section 1.4, the "section 1.4 offering party") desires to transfer the section 1.4 shares, such shareholder shall give written notice (the "take-along notice") to the other shareholder (the "non-selling shareholder") stating (i) the name and address of the transferee (the "non-qualified transferee"), and (ii) the price and terms upon which the non-qualified transferee proposes to purchase the section 1.4 shares. the non-selling shareholder shall have the irrevocable and exclusive option, but not the obligation (the "take-along option"), to sell to the non-qualified transferee, up to such number of shares proposed to be sold by the section 1.4 offering party (the "included shares") determined in accordance with section 1.4(b), at the price and on the terms set forth in the take-along notice. the take-along option shall be exercised by the non-selling shareholder by giving written notice to the section 1.4 offering party, within ten business days of receipt of the take-along notice, indicating its election to exercise the take-along option (the "participating shareholder"). failure by such non-selling shareholder to give such notice within the ten business day period shall be deemed an election by such non-selling shareholder not to sell its shares pursuant to that take-along notice. the closing with respect to any sale to a non-qualified transferee pursuant to this section shall be held at the time and place specified in the take-along notice but in any event within 30 days of the date the take-along notice is given; provided, that if through the exercise of reasonable efforts the section 1.4 offering party is unable to cause such transaction to close within 30 days, such period may be extended for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary to close such transaction. consummation of the sale of shares by the section 1.4 offering party to a non-qualified transferee shall be conditioned upon consummation of the sale by the participating shareholder to such non-qualified transferee of the included shares, if any. (b) the number of shares purchased from the participating shareholder shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares proposed to be purchased from the section 1.4 offering party by a non-qualified transferee by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares owned by the participating shareholder and the denominator of which is the sum of the total number of shares owned by the section 1.4 offering party and the participating shareholder. (c) the section 1.4 offering party shall arrange for payment directly by the non-qualified transferee to the participating shareholder, upon delivery of the certificate or certificates representing the shares duly endorsed for transfer, together with such other documents as the non-qualified transferee may reasonably request. the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the section 1.4 offering party and the participating shareholder in connection with a sale of shares subject to this section 1.4 shall be allocated pro rata based upon the number of shares sold by each shareholder to a non-qualified transferee. (d) if at end of 30 days following the date on which a take-along notice was given, the sale of shares by the section 1.4 offering party and the sale of the included shares have not been completed in accordance with the terms of the non-qualified transferee's offer, all certificates representing the included shares shall be returned to the non-selling shareholder, and all the restrictions on transfer contained in this agreement with respect to shares owned by the section 1.4 offering party shall again be in effect. 1.5. right of first refusal. (a) notwithstanding section 1.3 of this agreement, if at any time following the expiration of the two-year period after the date of this agreement, either shareholder receives an offer (or related series of offers) (an "offer") from any person or related group of persons to purchase a number of shares equal to 10% or more of the outstanding shares of the company (the "section 1.5 shares") and such shareholder desires to accept the offer, (the "selling shareholder") shall give written notice of its intent to accept the offer (a "transfer notice") to the other shareholder (the "section 1.5 non-selling shareholder"). such notice shall contain a true and complete description of the offer (including a copy thereof) containing (i) the shares subject to such offer, (ii) the proposed purchase price, (iii) the identity of the person or group making the offer and, if known by the selling shareholder, whether they are an agent for another party and (iv) all other material terms and conditions of the offer. the section 1.5 non-selling shareholder shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the shares subject to the offer (the "first option") on the same terms and conditions as set forth in such notice, which option shall be exercised by delivering to the selling shareholder written notice of its commitment to purchase the shares subject to the offer within five business days after receipt of the transfer notice (the "option period"). failure by the section 1.5 non-selling shareholder to give such notice within such five-business-day period shall be deemed an election by such section 1.5 non-selling shareholder not to purchase the section 1.5 shares. (b) the purchase of any shares pursuant to the exercise of the first option shall be completed not later than 45 days following delivery of the transfer notice with respect to such shares. in the event that the first option is not exercised, the selling shareholder shall have the right for a period of 45 days after the termination of the option period to transfer the shares subject to such offer to the person named in the transfer notice and on terms and conditions no less favorable to the selling shareholder than those set forth in the transfer notice. (c) this section 1.5 shall not be applicable with respect to transfers of shares effected through underwriters in a public offering or in the securities markets generally or transfers permitted under section 1.2. article ii legend in addition to any other legend required by applicable law, all certificates representing shares owned by any shareholder (other than shares subject to section 1.2(a)(iii)), or their permitted transferees, shall bear legend number (1) to assure the enforceability of this agreement until such time as such shares are sold to a non-shareholder after the two- year period following the date of this agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. all certificates representing shares not registered under the act shall bear in addition to legend (1), legend (2): (1) "the transfer of the securities represented by this certificate is restricted by an agreement on file at the offices of the corporation. the corporation will furnish a copy of such agreement to the record holder of this instrument without charge on request to the corporation at its principal place of business or registered office." (2) "the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 or the securities laws of any state and may not be sold or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an effective registration statement under such act and applicable state securities laws or an applicable exemption to the registration requirements of such act or such laws and the company may require an opinion of counsel with respect to such exemption." article iii voting covenants (a) the company and the shareholders agree to take all actions necessary to cause the board of directors of the company to consist at all times of eleven directors (subject to the rights of any holders of preferred stock of the company to elect directors in the event of a dividend arrearage). the nominees to the board of directors shall be determined in the following manner: the shareholders (other than rhi) shall nominate seven (7) members and rhi shall nominate four (4) members; provided, that so long as mel d. borer shall be the president of the company, the shareholders and the company will take all actions necessary to elect mr. borer as a member of the board of directors and during such time as mr. borer is the president and a director rhi shall only be entitled to nominate three (3) members. in the event that any shareholder reasonably objects to the nomination of any particular person or persons as a director, the shareholder who nominated such person or persons shall withdraw such nomination and nominate another person or persons in replacement thereof. (b) each shareholder shall, in any election for the company's board of directors, vote to cause the nominee or nominees of each party listed in this section to be elected to the board of directors of the company. each shareholder shall cause the holder of any proxy given by such shareholder to comply with this article iii. (c) should any director elected to the board be removed, become incapacitated, or die (the "affected director") the shareholder or party which nominated the affected director shall have the right to designate a replacement director to complete the term of the affected director on the board of directors of the company.

an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls rhi or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, insofar as losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading, and the company will reimburse rhi and each such director, officer, partner, agent or affiliate, underwriter and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument duly executed by or on behalf of rhi or such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof; and provided, further, that the company shall not be liable to rhi or any person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of registrable securities or any other person, if any, who controls rhi or such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of such person's failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or amended, to the person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of registrable securities to such person if such statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus so long as such final prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, have been furnished to such underwriter or rhi, as applicable. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of rhi or any such director, officer, partner, agent or affiliate or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by rhi. 2.7.2 indemnification by rhi. if any registrable securities are included in any registration statement, each of tfc and rhi will, and each hereby does,

indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding paragraphs of this section 2.7, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs related to the indemnified party's cooperation with the indemnifying party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such claim after the assumption of the defense thereof. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 2.7.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.7 shall for any reason be held by a court to be unavailable to an indemnified party under paragraph 2.7.1 or 2.7.2 hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in lieu of the amount paid or payable under paragraph 2.7.1 or 2.7.2 hereof, the indemnified party and the indemnifying party under paragraph 2.7.1 or 2.7.2 hereof shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating the same), (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company on one hand and tfc and rhi on the other which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if the allocation provided by paragraph (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company on one hand and tfc and rhi on the other. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. in addition, no person shall be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement of any action or claim, effected without such person's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 2.7.5 other indemnification. indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in the preceding paragraphs of this section 2.7 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and tfc

indemnification payments. the indemnification and contribution required by this section 2.7 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred. 2.7.7 disclosure of results of investigation. each of tfc and rhi covenants and agrees that if in the course of its investigation of the company anything comes to its attention that indicates there is or there could become a breach of the company's representations and warranties, covenants and agreements contained in any underwriting agreement, tfc and rhi shall promptly notify the company of such matter. failure to so notify the company shall cause tfc and rhi to lose its right to indemnification under section 2.7 with respect to such discovered matter. 3. rule 144. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may at any time permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, after such time as a public market exists for its common stock, the company agrees to: (a) use its best efforts to facilitate the sale of the registrable securities to the public, without registration under the securities act, pursuant to rule 144 promulgated under the securities act, provided that this shall not require the company to file

written consent of the other party. the observance of any term of this agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) by the party entitled to enforce such term, but any such waiver shall be effective only if in a writing signed by the party against which such waiver is to be asserted. except as otherwise specifically provided
