(d) certificates for option shares delivered at any closing hereunder shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend which shall read substantially as follows: -3- "the shares represented by this certificate are subject to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and bergen brunswig corporation, a copy of which is on file at the principal office of bergen brunswig corporation, have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and are subject to resale restrictions arising under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable state securities laws. a copy of such agreement will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by bergen brunswig corporation of a written request therefor." it is understood and agreed that the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend in connection with a transfer or sale if (i) bergen has been furnished with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to counsel for bergen, that such transfer or sale will not violate the securities act or applicable securities laws of any state or (ii) such transfer or sale shall have been registered and qualified pursuant to the securities act and any applicable state securities laws. 5. representations and warranties; covenants. ----------------------------------------- (a) bergen hereby represents and warrants to amerisource that: (i) bergen has full corporate right, power and authority to execute and deliver this option agreement and to perform all of its obligations hereunder; (ii) such execution, delivery and performance have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action by bergen, and no other corporate proceedings are necessary therefor; (iii) this option agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by bergen and represents a valid and legally binding obligation of bergen, enforceable against bergen in accordance with its terms; (iv) bergen has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and permit it to issue and, at all times from the date hereof through the date of the exercise in full or the expiration or termination of the option, shall have reserved for issuance upon exercise of the option, 26,961,420 shares of bergen common stock (subject to adjustment as provided herein), all of which, upon issuance in accordance with the terms of this option agreement, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and shall be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights of any shareholder of bergen; and (v) the bergen rights agreement has been amended, and will remain amended (and no replacement plan will be adopted), so as to provide that none of amerisource and its affiliates will become an "acquiring person" and that no "stock acquisition date" or "distribution date" (as such terms are defined in the -4- bergen rights agreement) will occur as a result of the execution of this option agreement, the grant of the option hereunder or the acquisition or transfer of shares of bergen common stock by amerisource pursuant to the exercise, in whole or in part, of the option. (b) bergen hereby agrees that, prior to the termination of the option pursuant to section 3(a) hereof, bergen shall not take, or allow to be taken, any action that could result in the representations and warranties set forth in section 5(a)(v) hereof becoming false or inaccurate. (c) amerisource hereby represents and warrants to bergen that: (i) amerisource has full corporate right, power and authority to execute and deliver this option agreement and to perform all of its obligations hereunder; (ii) such execution, delivery and performance have been authorized by all requisite corporate action by amerisource, and no other corporate proceedings are necessary therefor; (iii) this option agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by amerisource and represents a valid and legally binding obligation of amerisource, enforceable against amerisource in accordance with its terms; and (iv) any bergen common stock acquired by amerisource upon exercise of the option will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in compliance with the securities act. 6. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. ----------------------------------------- in the event of any change in bergen common stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, recapitalizations or the like or in the event of any new issuance of bergen common stock (other than an issuance pursuant to the option), the type and number of shares subject to the option, and the purchase price, shall be adjusted appropriately. 7. repurchase. ---------- (a) at the written request of amerisource, at any time during the option exercise period and, if a notice of exercise has been given but the related closing has not occurred, during the period from the notice date to the closing date (the "amerisource repurchase period"), bergen shall repurchase the option ----------------------------- from amerisource together with all (but not less than all) option shares purchased by amerisource pursuant thereto with respect to which amerisource then has beneficial ownership, at a price (when calculated on a per share basis, the "per share repurchase price") equal to the sum of: -------------------------- -5- (i) the difference between (x) the "market/tender offer price" for ------------------------- shares of bergen common stock (defined as the higher of (1) the highest price per share at which a tender or exchange offer has been made for shares of bergen common stock or (2) the highest closing price per share of bergen common stock as reported by the nyse composite tape, in each case, for any day within that portion of the amerisource repurchase period which precedes the date amerisource gives notice of the required repurchase under this section 7) and (y) the purchase price (subject to adjustment as provided in section 6), multiplied by the number of option shares with respect to which the option has not been exercised or has been exercised but the related closing has not occurred, but only if such market/tender offer price is greater than such exercise price; and (ii) the greater of the market/tender offer price and the purchase price paid for any option shares acquired upon exercise of the option, multiplied by the number of option shares so acquired. (b) in the event amerisource exercises its rights under this section 7, bergen shall, within 10 business days thereafter, pay the required amount to amerisource by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by amerisource and amerisource shall surrender to bergen the option and the certificates evidencing any option shares acquired thereunder with respect to which amerisource then has beneficial ownership. (c) in determining the market/tender offer price, the value of any consideration other than cash shall be determined by an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by amerisource with the consent of bergen, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (d) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this option agreement, amerisource may not exercise its rights pursuant to this section 7 in a manner that would result in total profit (as defined below) of more than the profit cap (as defined below); provided, however, that nothing in this sentence -------- ------- shall limit amerisource's ability to exercise the option in accordance with its terms. as used herein, the term "total profit" means the aggregate (before ------------ income taxes) of the following: (i) all amounts received by amerisource or concurrently being paid to amerisource pursuant to section 7 for the repurchase of the unexercised portion of the option, (ii) (a) the amounts received by amerisource or concurrently being paid to amerisource pursuant to the sale of option shares (or any other securities into which such option shares are converted or exchanged), including sales made to bergen or pursuant to a registration statement under the securities act or any exemption therefrom, less (b) amerisource's aggregate purchase price for such option shares and (iii) all amounts received by amerisource from bergen or concurrently being paid to amerisource pursuant to section 8.5 of the merger agreement (other than for payments with respect to expenses). as used herein, the term "profit cap" shall ---------- mean $125,000,000. 8. repurchase at option of bergen. ------------------------------ -6- except to the extent that amerisource shall have previously exercised its rights under section 7, at the request of bergen during the six-month period commencing 180 days following the first occurrence of a purchase event, bergen may repurchase from amerisource, and amerisource shall sell to bergen, all (but not less than all) of the bergen common stock acquired by amerisource pursuant to the option and with respect to which amerisource has beneficial ownership at the time of such repurchase at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) the market/tender offer price per share (calculated in the manner set forth in section 7(a)(i) hereof but utilizing the period beginning on the occurrence of a purchase event and ending on the date bergen exercises its repurchase right pursuant to this section 8), (ii) the per share repurchase price or (iii) the sum of (a) the aggregate purchase price of the shares so repurchased plus (b) interest on the aggregate purchase price paid for the shares so repurchased from the date of purchase by amerisource to the date of repurchase at the highest rate of interest publicly announced by citibank, n.a., in the city of new york, as its prime or base lending or reference rate during such period, less any dividends received on the shares so repurchased, which sum shall be divided by the number of option shares to be repurchased by bergen. any repurchase under this section 8 shall be consummated in accordance with section 7(b). 9. registration rights. ------------------- at any time within two years after a closing, bergen shall, if requested by amerisource or any affiliate of amerisource that is a beneficial owner of option shares (each a "holder"), as expeditiously as possible file a ------ registration statement on a form for general use under the securities act if necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of option shares in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition requested by any such holder. each such holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by bergen for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. bergen shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. the registration effected under this section 9 shall be at bergen's expense except for underwriting commissions and the fees and disbursements of such holders' counsel attributable to the registration of such option shares. in no event shall bergen be required to effect more than two registrations hereunder. the filing of any registration statement required hereunder may be delayed for such period of time (not to exceed 90 days) (i) as may reasonably be required to facilitate any public distribution by bergen of bergen common stock, (ii) if a special audit of bergen would otherwise be required in connection therewith or (iii) during which bergen is in possession of material information concerning it, its business affairs or a material transaction in each case the public disclosure of which bergen reasonably determines in good faith could have a material adverse effect on bergen or significantly disrupt such material transaction. if requested by any such holder in connection with such registration, bergen shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares on terms and including obligations and indemnities which are customary for parties similarly situated. upon receiving any request for registration under this section 9 from any holder, bergen agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to bergen to be entitled to -7- registration rights under this section 9, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. 10. profit limitation. ----------------- (a) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, in no event shall amerisource's total profit exceed the profit cap and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, amerisource, at its sole election, shall either (i) deliver to bergen for cancellation option shares previously purchased by amerisource, (ii) pay cash or other consideration to bergen, (iii) reduce the amount of the fee payable to amerisource under section 8.5 of the merger agreement (other than for payments with respect to expenses) or (iv) undertake any combination thereof, so that amerisource's total profit shall not exceed the profit cap after taking into account the foregoing actions. (b) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the option may not be exercised for a number of option shares that would, as of the notice date, result in a notional total profit (as defined below) of more than the profit cap, and, if exercise of the option otherwise would exceed the profit cap, amerisource, at its sole discretion, may increase the exercise price for that number of option shares set forth in the exercise notice so that the notional total profit shall not exceed the profit cap; provided, however, that -------- ------- nothing in this sentence shall restrict any exercise of the option otherwise permitted by this section 10(b) on any subsequent date at the purchase price set forth in section 2 if such exercise would not then be restricted under this section 10(b). as used herein, the term "notional total profit" means, with --------------------- respect to any number of option shares as to which amerisource may propose to exercise the option, the total profit determined as of the notice date assuming that the option was exercised on such date for such number of option shares and assuming such option shares, together with all other option shares held by amerisource and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market price per share for bergen common stock as reported by the nyse composite tape as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions) and including all amounts theretofore received or concurrently being paid to amerisource pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of total profit. 11. listing. ------- if bergen common stock or any other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option are then listed on the nyse or any other national securities exchange, bergen, upon the request of amerisource, will promptly file an application to list the option shares or other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option on the nyse or such other exchange and will use its best efforts to obtain approval of such listings as soon as practicable. 12. survival. -------- the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties hereto shall survive any closing. -8- 13. severability. ------------ any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this option agreement held by a court or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, voidness or unenforceability, but neither the remaining terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this option agreement nor the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction shall be affected or impaired thereby. any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this option agreement that is so found to be so broad as to be unenforceable shall be interpreted to be as broad as is enforceable. 14. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) expenses. each of the parties hereto shall pay all costs and expenses -------- incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel, except as otherwise provided herein.

(e) notices. all notices or other communications which are required or ------- permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered in accordance with section 9.2 of the merger agreement (which is incorporated herein by reference). (f) counterparts. this option agreement may be executed in counterparts, ------------ and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but both such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement. -9- (g) further assurances. in the event of any exercise of the option by ------------------ amerisource, bergen and amerisource shall execute and deliver all other documents and instruments and take all other action that may be reasonably necessary in order to consummate the transactions provided for by such exercise. (h) specific performance. the parties hereto agree that if for any reason -------------------- amerisource or bergen shall have failed to perform its obligations under this option agreement, then either party hereto seeking to enforce this option agreement against such non-performing party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief, and the parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief. this provision is without prejudice to any other rights that either party hereto may have against the other party hereto for any failure to perform its obligations under this option agreement.

(k) waiver and amendment. any provision of this option agreement may be -------------------- waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefits of such provision. this -10- option agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties hereto. -11- in witness whereof, amerisource and
