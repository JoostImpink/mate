are material, shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the other party and shall survive the closing regardless of any investigation and shall not merge in the performance of any obligation by either party hereto; provided, however, that such representations and warranties shall expire on the same dates as and to the extent that the rights to indemnification with respect thereto under section 11 shall expire. section 11. indemnification. - ------------------------------- 11.1 indemnification by the sellers. subject to section 8.5 hereof (which shall constitute the exclusive indemnification for liability relating to registration of securities pursuant to section 8), sellers jointly and severally agree subsequent to the closing to indemnify and hold the company and buyer (individually a "buyer indemnified party" and collectively the "buyer indemnified parties") harmless from and against any damages, liabilities, losses, taxes, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees of counsel) of any kind or nature whatsoever (whether or not arising out of third-party claims and including all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of the foregoing) which may be sustained or suffered by any of them arising out of or based upon any of the following matters: (a) fraud or a deliberate or wilful breach by the company or any seller of any of their representations, warranties or covenants under this agreement or in any certificate, schedule or exhibit delivered pursuant hereto; (b) any other breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the company or any seller under this agreement or in any certificate, schedule or exhibit delivered pursuant hereto, or by reason of any claim, action or proceeding asserted or 42 47 instituted growing out of any matter or thing constituting a breach of such representations, warranties or covenants; and (c) any liability of the company for taxes arising from an event or transaction prior to the closing or as a result of the closing which have not been paid or provided for or reserved against by the company, including without limitation, any increase in taxes due to the unavailability of any loss or deduction claimed by the company. sellers' obligation to indemnify buyer under sections 11.1(b) and 11.1(c) shall expire on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the closing date or (ii) the date of issuance of the first independent audit report on the financial statements of the buyer and the company following the closing date. 11.2 indemnification by buyer. subject to section 8.5 hereof (which shall constitute the exclusive remedy for liability relating to registration of securities pursuant to section 8), buyer agrees, subsequent to the closing and for a period expiring on the first anniversary of the closing, to indemnify and hold the sellers (individually a "seller indemnified party" and collectively the "seller indemnified parties") harmless from and against any damages, liabilities, losses and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees of counsel) of any kind or nature whatsoever (whether or not arising out of third-party claims and including all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of the foregoing) which may be sustained or suffered by any of them arising out of or based upon any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by buyer in this agreement or in any certificate delivered by buyer hereunder, or by reason of any third-party claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted growing out of any matter or thing constituting such a breach. 11.3 notice; defense of claims. an indemnified party may make claims for indemnification hereunder by giving written notice thereof to the indemnifying party within the period in which indemnification claims can be made hereunder. if indemnification is sought for a claim or liability asserted by a third party, the indemnified party shall also give written notice thereof to the indemnifying party promptly after it receives notice of the claim or liability being asserted, but the failure to do so shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability except to the extent that it is prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving such notice. such notice shall summarize the bases for the claim for indemnification and any claim or liability being asserted by a third party. within 20 days after receiving such notice the indemnifying party shall give written notice to the indemnified party stating whether it disputes the claim for indemnification and whether it will defend against any third party claim or liability at its own cost and expense. if the indemnifying party fails to give notice that it disputes an indemnification claim within 20 days after receipt of notice thereof, it shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the claim, which shall become immediately due and payable. the indemnifying party shall be entitled to direct the defense against a third party claim or liability with counsel selected by it (subject to the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) as long as the indemnifying party is conducting a good faith and diligent defense. the indemnified party shall at all times have the 43 48 right to fully participate in the defense of a third party claim or liability at its own expense directly or through counsel; provided, however, that if the named parties to the action or proceeding include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the indemnified party is advised that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, the indemnified party may engage separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. the indemnified party shall not settle or compromise any claim by a third party for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless suit shall have been instituted against it and the indemnifying party shall not have taken control of such suit after notification thereof as provided above. if no such notice of intent to dispute and defend a third party claim or liability is given by the indemnifying party, or if such good faith and diligent defense is not being or ceases to be conducted by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right, at the expense of the indemnifying party, to undertake the defense of such claim or liability (with counsel selected by the indemnified party), and to compromise or settle it, exercising reasonable business judgment. the indemnified party shall make available such information and assistance as the indemnifying party may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in such defense, at the expense of the indemnifying party. 11.4 limitations of liability; payment. none of the sellers shall be required to indemnify buyer for any claims or liabilities hereunder if the aggregate of such claims does not exceed $75,000 (the "deductible amount"), whereupon sellers shall be required to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to the excess, if any, of the full amount of all such claims over the deductible amount (the "indemnification amount"). each of sellers and buyer hereby agree that buyer shall be reimbursed as follows: (a) first, the indemnification amount shall be paid out of the escrowed purchase price pursuant to the escrow agreement; (b) second, if the indemnification amount exceeds the escrowed purchase price, such excess shall be paid by sellers to the buyer in cash, or, in lieu of cash, at sellers' option, by tender to the buyer of an appropriate number of brooktrout shares, at the fair market value thereof, determined in the same manner as set forth in the escrow agreement (whether or not the escrow agreement is in force at such time), until the indemnification amount exceeds $6 million; and (c) finally, to the extent that the indemnification amount otherwise exceeds $6 million, such excess shall be payable as follows and shall be payable only after the second anniversary of the closing date: at sellers' option (i) by payment of such excess in cash or (ii) by the tender to the buyer of an appropriate number of brooktrout shares, which shall be valued at the average per share daily closing price on the nasdaq national market system for the period five (5) business days ending two business days prior to the second anniversary of the closing date (the "second anniversary closing price"); 44 49 provided that the liability of sellers to buyer under this agreement shall in no event exceed $12,000,000 in the aggregate or, in the event that the sellers have elected to tender brooktrout shares pursuant to subsection 11.4(c), the liability of sellers to buyer under this agreement shall in no event exceed $6 million plus the product of the second anniversary closing price multiplied by 237,664 (which shall in no event exceed $12 million). 11.5 exclusive remedy. the buyer, the company and the sellers acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this article 11 shall be their exclusive remedy for any damages arising out of or related to this agreement. except as provided in this article 11, no party shall have any right to money damages for any breach of this agreement or in contract, tort or otherwise arising out of or related to this agreement. section 12. miscellaneous. - ------------------------------ 12.1 fees and expenses. ----------------- (a) except as set forth in section 9.2, each of the parties will bear

(b) in no event later than june 12, 1996, the company shall cause to be prepared, at the buyer's expense, draft federal and state income tax returns for the company for its short tax year ended on the closing date. such returns shall be prepared by deloitte & touche, llp, or another firm of certified public accountants acceptable to the sellers. provided that the sellers have, as provided in section 12.14(b) hereof, received the first installment payment of the dividend described in section 12.14(a), such returns shall be prepared on the accrual method of accounting and shall be accompanied by a completed form 3115; unless the prior consent of each of the sellers is obtained, the preparation of such returns shall otherwise be consistent with the manner in which the company's returns for prior tax years have been prepared. promptly upon preparation of such draft returns, copies thereof, together with copies of the company's financial and other information used to prepare them, shall be forwarded to each of the sellers. within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such returns and such information, each seller shall give written notice to the company of any errors or any inconsistencies with the manner in which the company's prior tax returns have been prepared, believed by the seller to exist in either of such returns. the sellers and the company shall promptly thereafter attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreement regarding items or matters which any seller believes to be in error, but which the company believes to be correct. any disagreement which cannot be so resolved by june 30, 1996, other than a good-faith disagreement over how the federal or state tax laws ought to be interpreted, shall be referred by either party to the american arbitration association to be settled by arbitration in boston, massachusetts in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of said association. unless otherwise directed by the arbitrator, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne 50% by the sellers and 50% by the company. any disagreement over how the federal or state tax laws ought to be interpreted which cannot be resolved by july 15, 1996, shall be resolved in favor of the company's good-faith interpretation. however, nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed as an agreement with respect to the preparation or filing of any individual income tax return of any of the sellers, or as a limitation of any sort on the ability of any seller to prepare and file his or her individual income tax returns as the seller sees fit. promptly after any disagreements have been resolved as provided above, the company shall cause the company's federal and state income tax returns for the short year ended on the closing date to be prepared, and shall cause such returns to be timely filed (by the original or extended due dates), such returns to be substantially identical to the agreed-upon draft returns. 48 53 12.14 payment of tax liabilities dividends. ------------------------------------- (a) consistent with past dividend payment practices of the company, the company shall declare a dividend to its shareholders of record as of the day immediately preceding the closing date, for the purpose of distributing an amount of cash to the sellers approximately equal to the federal and state tax liabilities of the sellers resulting from the company's operations during the short tax year beginning january 1, 1996 and ending on the closing date, calculated using the accrual method of accounting. such dividend shall be payable in cash in two installments on or after the closing date, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section 12.14, and shall be in an aggregate amount to be determined according to the following formula: forty-four percent (44%) multiplied by the net pass-through income (as hereinafter defined) of the company for the period beginning january 1, 1996 and ending on the closing date. for this purpose, "net pass-through income" shall mean the sum of (i) the company's nonseparately computed income as defined in internal revenue code section 1366(a)(2), plus (ii) the company's items of income described in internal revenue code section 1366(a)(1) other than any tax-exempt income and any net capital loss. (b) the first installment of the dividend described in paragraph (a) of this section 12.14 shall be paid not later than may 31, 1996. the amount of such installment shall equal ninety percent (90%) of what the aggregate amount of such dividend would be if it were determined, according to the formula set forth in paragraph (a), based on the company's draft federal income tax return required to be prepared under section 12.13(b) hereinabove, including all changes to such return that have been agreed to as of such date. the second installment of such dividend shall be determined and paid promptly after any and all disagreements regarding the preparation of the company's federal income tax return for the period ended on the closing date have been resolved as provided in section 12.13(b) and the company's federal income tax return has been prepared for filing as therein provided. the amount of such installment shall equal the difference between (i) the aggregate amount of the dividend described in paragraph (a) of this section 12.14, according to the formula therein set forth and based on the company's federal income tax return as so finally prepared for filing, and (ii) the amount of the first installment payment as hereinabove determined. any payment required hereunder which is not paid by june 3, 1996, shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum.

(the "company"), buyer is acquiring all of the outstanding common stock of the company, which is currently held by the sellers, as set forth in the agreement; and whereas, the sellers have agreed to indemnify buyer against breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants made by the sellers and the company in the agreement and against certain other matters as specified in section 11 of the agreement; whereas, to secure partially the payment of the indemnification obligations of the sellers, the sellers are depositing with the escrow agent 10% of the shares of common stock of buyer payable to the sellers under the agreement to be held in escrow as hereinafter provided. now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises of the parties herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. establishment of escrow. sellers have herewith deposited with the escrow agent and the escrow agent acknowledges receipt of certificates for 46,582 shares of common stock of buyer (hereafter with any other securities, cash or other property delivered to or held by the escrow agent under the terms hereof referred to as the "escrow fund"). any common stock of buyer or other securities from time to time held in the escrow fund shall be registered in the name of the escrow agent or its nominee. the escrow fund shall be held by the escrow agent in escrow subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. 2. dividends and distributions; investment of cash; voting of shares. any securities or other property (except ordinary cash dividends) issued with respect to, or in exchange for, any securities held in the escrow fund, shall become a part of the escrow fund and shall be held hereunder upon the same terms as the securities with respect to or in exchange for which such securities shall have been issued. any rights to purchase securities distributed from time to time on the shares held in the escrow fund shall be sold promptly by the escrow agent and the proceeds of such sale shall be added to the escrow fund. all cash * the certificates set forth on exhibit a hereto have been delivered to the escrow agent in the names of the sellers, accompanied by executed stock powers by beverly fox and robert u. friedman in favor of the escrow agent. as of the date hereof, a stock power by andrew fox has not been delivered to the escrow agent. 2 dividends on securities held in the escrow fund shall not constitute part of the escrow fund but shall be distributed by the buyer directly to sellers. the escrow agent shall invest any cash held in the escrow fund as directed in writing by the sellers in u.s. government obligations or bank certificates of deposit, and it shall not be responsible for any loss incurred upon any such investment made in accordance with such instructions; provided however, until written instructions are received from the sellers' representative by the escrow agent to the contrary, all cash held in the escrow fund shall be invested in automatic sweep vehicles investing primarily in u.s. treasury obligations including the federated treasury obligation fund. in the event of any meeting of stockholders of buyer during the term of this agreement, the escrow agent shall send to the sellers' representative (as defined in the agreement), promptly (but in no event later than seven (7) days after receipt from the buyer), copies of any notices, proxies and proxy material in connection with such meeting. the escrow agent shall execute and deliver to the sellers' representative a proxy authorizing sellers to vote the whole number of shares of common stock of the buyer in the escrow fund. any of the shares of common stock of the buyer held in the escrow fund as to which the escrow agent receives no direction shall not be voted. the parties hereby authorize the escrow agent to apply to buyer's transfer agent, fleet national bank, or any successor transfer agent. 3. claims against escrow fund. at any time or times prior to the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of may 29, 1996 (the "closing date") or (ii) the date of issuance of the first independent audit report on the financial statements of the buyer and the company following the closing date (the "independent audit reports"), buyer may make claims against the escrow fund for indemnification pursuant to the agreement. buyer shall notify the sellers' representative and the escrow agent in writing of each such claim specifying the amount and basis thereof. if the sellers shall dispute such claim, the sellers representative shall give written notice of such objection to buyer and the escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of buyer's claim; otherwise, such claim shall be deemed to have been acknowledged to be payable in the full amount thereof and shall be paid forthwith to buyer by delivery of shares of buyer's common stock or other property or both (taking proportionately from each class of shares or property held in the escrow fund) having a fair market value (determined as hereafter provided) equal to the amount of such claim. a notice of claim is deemed received on the second business day after the date of the postmark on the registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) containing the notice of claim. the escrow agent shall not be deemed to have received the notice until it has been actually received by the corporate trust department. 4. disputed claims. if the sellers shall dispute an indemnification claim of buyer or the company as above provided, the escrow agent shall set aside a portion of the escrow fund whose fair market value is sufficient to pay said claim in full. if the disputed claim has not been resolved or compromised within sixty (60) days after the notice of dispute of the same, said claim shall be referred by either party to the american arbitration association (the "association"), to be settled by arbitration in boston, massachusetts in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the association, and judgment upon the award rendered by the 2 3 arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. unless otherwise directed by the arbitrator, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne 50% by buyer and 50% by the sellers. the determination of the arbitrator as to the amount, if any, of the indemnification claim which is properly allowable, shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and shall be forthwith paid by the escrow agent to buyer out of the escrow fund at the fair market value of the property held therein. 5. fair market value of escrow fund. for the purposes of this agreement, the fair market value of the property held in the escrow fund shall be conclusively determined by the escrow agent at the time of each payment or distribution to be made out of the escrow fund and at the time of setting aside of a portion of the fund for such payments; provided, that shares of common stock of buyer shall be valued at $25.17 per share during the term of this escrow agreement. the escrow agent will not accept securities other than the common stock of buyer unless accompanied by a written statement setting forth the per share value of such securities. 6. termination. this agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the closing date or (ii) the date of issuance of the independent audit reports; provided, however, that if there are outstanding indemnification claims on such date, this agreement shall continue in effect until all indemnification claims made by buyer pursuant to section 4 hereof prior to said date shall have been disposed of. buyer shall notify the escrow agent in writing of the issuance of the independent audit reports. as of the termination date, shares of common stock of buyer or other property in the escrow fund having a fair market value equal to 110% of the amount of all disputed and undisputed claims made by buyer pursuant to section 4 hereof, rounded up to the nearest whole share, will be held by the escrow agent and the escrow agent shall distribute within five (5) business days of the termination date the balance of the escrow fund, if any, then held by it to the sellers based on their pro rata interest as set forth on exhibit a hereto. at such time as all remaining indemnification claims hereunder have been resolved, the escrow agent shall distribute the remaining escrow fund, if any, to the sellers within five (5) business days of the resolution of the last indemnification claim hereunder. 7. the escrow fund. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the escrow agent shall promptly dispose of all or any part of the escrow fund as directed by a writing signed by the sellers' representative and buyer. the reasonable fees and expenses of the escrow agent, including the fees and disbursements of its counsel, in connection with its performance of this agreement shall be paid by buyer and,
