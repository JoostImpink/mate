(f) tag-along rights. (i) if an investor (an "investor selling stockholder") wishes to transfer shares to a third party purchaser, the company or any of its subsidiaries other than in an exempt transfer, then each other stockholder (each, a "tag-along rightholder") shall have the right to sell to such third party purchaser, the company, or any of its subsidiaries, upon the terms set forth in the offering notice, that number of shares held by such tag-along rightholder equal to that percentage of the offered securities determined by dividing (a) the total number of shares then owned by such tag-along rightholder by (b) the sum of (x) the total number of shares then owned by all such tag-along rightholders with respect to which tag-along rightholders are exercising their rights pursuant to this section 3.1(f) and (y) the total number of shares then owned by the investor selling stockholder. the investor selling stockholder and the tag-along rightholder(s) exercising their rights pursuant to this section 3.1(f) shall effect the sale of the offered securities and such tag-along rightholder(s) shall sell the number of offered securities required to be sold by such tag-along rightholder(s) pursuant to this section 3.1(f)(i), and the number of offered securities to be sold to such third party purchaser, the company or any of its subsidiaries by the investor selling stockholder shall be reduced accordingly.

(g) drag-along rights. for so long as heartland is entitled to the right to designate directors as set forth in section 6.3, in the event that one or more of the heartland entities (the "drag-along rightholders") receive a bona fide offer from a third party purchaser to purchase (including a purchase by merger) all of the shares held by the investor stockholders or all or a substantial portion of the consolidated assets of the company, the drag-along rightholders may send written notice (the "drag-along notice") to the company and the other stockholders (the "drag-along sellers") notifying them they will be required to sell all (but not less than all) of their shares in such sale (or, in the case of a merger or asset sale, vote in favor of such sale). upon receipt of a drag-along notice, each drag-along seller receiving such notice shall be obligated to (i) sell all of its shares in the transaction (including a sale by merger or asset sale) contemplated by the drag-along notice for the same consideration per share and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as the drag-along rightholders (including payment of its pro rata share of all costs associated with such transaction); if, but only if, the drag-along seller shall receive cash and/or other freely tradable consideration having a fair market value of at least $11 per share, adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications and other recapitalizations and (ii) otherwise take all necessary action in its capacity as a stockholder to cause the consummation of such transaction, including voting its shares in favor of such transaction and not exercising any appraisal rights in connection therewith. the obligations of the drag-along sellers in respect of a transaction under this section 3.1(g) are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) upon the consummation of the transaction, each drag-along seller shall have the right to receive cash and/or other consideration having a fair market value of at least $11 per share (adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications and recapitalizations) in the same form and amount per share of consideration paid to drag-along rightholders in such transaction or any other transaction related thereto (such as a payment for consulting or management services or non-compete payments); (ii) if any drag-along seller is given an option -15- as to the form and amount of consideration to be received, each other drag-along seller will be given the same option with respect to its applicable pro rata share; and (iii) no drag-along seller shall be obligated under the terms of any agreement respecting any transaction subject to this section 3.1(g) to indemnify any person in an amount greater than the proceeds to be received by such drag-along seller in such transaction. (h) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the following transfers will not be subject to the provisions of section 2.4 or sections 3.1(a) through (e): a transfer of any shares pursuant to rule 144 or a transfer pursuant to a registration statement filed under the securities act. 3.2 involuntary transfers. (a) rights of first offer upon involuntary transfer. if an involuntary transfer of any shares (the "transferred shares") owned by any stockholder shall occur, then the company and the investor stockholders (unless such stockholder is the stockholder transferring the transferred shares) (for the purpose of section 3.2, each, a "it rightholder" and collectively, the "it rightholders") shall have the same rights as specified in sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.1(c), respectively, with respect to such transferred shares as if the involuntary transfer had been a proposed voluntary transfer by a selling stockholder and shall be governed by section 3.1 except that (i) the time periods shall run from the date of agreement as to the purchase price applicable to such involuntary transfer with written determination of fair value in accordance with section 3.2(b), (ii) such rights shall be exercised by notice to the transferee of such transferred shares (the "involuntary transferee") rather than to the stockholder who suffered or will suffer the involuntary transfer and (iii) the purchase price per transferred share shall be agreed upon by the involuntary transferee and the company and/or the purchasing it rightholders purchasing a majority of the transferred shares, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such parties fail to agree as to such purchase price, the purchase price shall be the fair value thereof as determined in accordance with section 3.2(b). (b) fair value. if the parties fail to agree upon the purchase price of the transferred shares in accordance with section 3.2(a) hereof, then the company or the it rightholders, as the case may be, shall purchase the transferred shares at a purchase price equal to the fair value thereof. the fair value of the transferred shares shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm or nationally recognized expert experienced in the valuation of corporations engaged in the business conducted by the company. within five (5) business days after the date the applicable parties determine that they cannot agree as to the purchase price, the involuntary transferee and the board of directors (in the case of a purchase by the company), or the purchasing it rightholders purchasing a majority of the transferred shares being purchased by the purchasing it rightholders (if the company -16- is not purchasing any transferred shares), or the board of directors and such purchasing it rightholders jointly (in the case of a purchase by the company and it rightholders), as the case may be, shall designate one such appraiser that is willing and able to conduct such determination. if either the involuntary transferee or the board of directors or the purchasing it rightholders or both, or all, as the case may be, fails to make such designation within such period, then any other party may apply to the american arbitration association or a court of appropriate jurisdiction for the appointment of such an appraiser. the appraiser shall conduct its determination as promptly as practicable, and the fair value of the transferred shares shall be determined by such appraiser. such determination shall be final and binding on the involuntary transferee, the company and the rightholders. the involuntary transferee shall be responsible for one-half the fees and expenses of the appraiser designated by or on behalf of it, and the company and/or the purchasing it rightholders in proportion to the ratio in which they are purchasing transferred shares shall be responsible for one-half of the fees and expenses of the appraiser. for purposes of this section 3.2(b), the "fair value" of the transferred shares means the fair market value of such transferred shares determined in accordance with this section 3.2(b) based upon all considerations that the appraiser determine to be relevant. (c) closing. the closing of any purchase under this section 3.2 shall be held at the executive office of the company at 11:00 a.m., local time, on the earlier to occur of (a) the fifth business day after the purchase price per transferred share shall have been agreed upon by the involuntary transferee and the company or the purchasing it rightholders, as the case may be, in accordance with section 3.2(a)(iii), or (b) the fifth business day after the determination of the fair value of the transferred shares in accordance with section 3.2(b), or at such other time and place as the parties to the transaction may agree. at such closing, the involuntary transferee shall deliver certificates, if applicable, or other instruments or documents representing the transferred shares being purchased under this section 3.2, duly endorsed with a signature guarantee for transfer and accompanied by all requisite transfer taxes, if any, and such transferred shares shall be free and clear of any liens (other than those arising hereunder) arising through the action or inaction of the involuntary transferee and the involuntary transferee shall so represent and warrant, and further represent and warrant that it is the beneficial owner of such transferred shares. the company or each rightholder, as the case may be, purchasing such transferred shares shall deliver at closing payment in full in immediately available funds for such transferred shares. at such closing, all parties to the transaction shall execute such additional documents as are otherwise necessary or appropriate. (d) general. in the event that the provisions of this section 3.2 shall be held to be unenforceable with respect to any particular involuntary transfer, the company and the it rightholders shall have the rights specified in sections 3.1(b) and 3.1(c), respectively, with -17- respect to any transfer by an involuntary transferee of such shares, and each it rightholder agrees that any involuntary transfer shall be subject to such rights, in which case the involuntary transferee shall be deemed to be the selling stockholder for purposes of section 3.1 of this agreement and shall be bound by the provisions of section 3.1 and other related provisions of this agreement. 3.3 certain transactions.

investor holders shall be known as the "initiating holders," as appropriate), may each make a -6- written request to the company to register, and the company shall register, under the securities act (other than pursuant to a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 or any successor thereto) a "demand registration", the number of registrable securities stated in such request; provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to effect (x) more than four (4) such demand registrations at the request of initiating investor holders, and (y) in the aggregate not more than four (4) such demand registrations at the request of initiating blackstone and initiating wasserstein holders: two of which shall be at the request of initiating blackstone holders and two of which shall be at the request of initiating wasserstein holders. for purposes of the preceding sentence, two or more registration statements filed in response to one demand shall be counted as one demand registration; provided, however, that any such registration statement filed at the request of an initiating holder and subsequently withdrawn at the request of that initiating holder shall be counted as a demand registration unless the withdrawing initiating holder pays the expenses associated with such registration statement in which case such registration shall not be so counted. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no demand registration need be effected by the company within six (6) months after the effectiveness of any registration statement pursuant to a demand registration. the company shall not be obliged to include more than 10 million shares (as equitably adjusted for stock splits, stock combinations and similar events) in any registration statement pursuant to a demand registration, inclusive of any shares to be included pursuant to any incidental or piggy-back rights under this agreement. if the board of directors, in its good faith judgment, determines that any registration of registrable securities should not be made or continued because it would materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or merger or other material transaction involving the company (a "valid business reason"), the company may (x) postpone filing a registration statement relating to a demand registration until such valid business reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than ninety (90) days, and (y) in case a registration statement has been filed relating to a demand registration, if the valid business reason has not resulted from actions taken by the company, the company, upon the approval of a majority of the board of directors, such majority to include at least one investor director and the blackstone director, if applicable, and the wasserstein director, if applicable, may cause such registration statement to be withdrawn and its effectiveness terminated or may postpone amending or supplementing such registration statement. the company shall give written notice of its determination to postpone or withdraw a registration statement and of the fact that the valid business reason for such postponement or withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the company may not postpone or withdraw a filing under this section 3.1 more than once in any twelve (12) month period. each request for a demand registration by the initiating holders shall state the amount of the registrable securities proposed to be sold and the intended method of disposition thereof. -7- 3.2 incidental or "piggy-back" rights with respect to a demand registration. each of the designated holders (other than initiating holders which have requested a registration under section 3.1) may offer its or his registrable securities under any demand registration pursuant to this section 3.2. within five (5) business days after the receipt of a request for a demand registration from an initiating holder, the company shall (i) give written notice thereof to all of the designated holders (other than initiating holders which have requested a registration under section 3.1) and (ii) subject to section 3.5, include in such registration all of the registrable securities held by such designated holders from whom the company has received a written request for inclusion therein within ten (10) days of the receipt by such designated holders of such written notice referred to in clause (i) above. each such request by such designated holders shall specify the number of registrable securities proposed to be registered. the failure of any designated holder to respond within such 10-day period referred to in clause (ii) above shall be deemed to be a waiver of such designated holder's rights under this article iii with respect to such demand registration. any designated holder may waive its rights under this article iii prior to the expiration of such 10-day period by giving written notice to the company, with a copy to the initiating holders. if a designated holder sends the company a written request for inclusion of part or all of such designated holder's registrable securities in a registration, such designated holder shall not be entitled to withdraw or revoke such request without the prior written consent of the company in its sole discretion unless, as a result of facts or circumstances arising after the date on which such request was made relating to the company or to market conditions, such designated holder reasonably determines that participation in such registration would have a material adverse effect on such designated holder. 3.3 effective demand registration. the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such demand registration to become effective not later than sixty (60) days after it receives a request under section 3.1 hereof. a registration shall not constitute a demand registration until it has become effective and remains continuously effective for the shorter of (i) 90 days and (ii) the period during which all registrable securities registered in the demand registration are sold; provided, however, that a registration shall not constitute a demand registration if (x) after such demand registration has become effective, such registration or the related offer, sale or distribution of registrable securities thereunder is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the initiating holders and such interference is not thereafter eliminated or (y) the conditions specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such demand registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure by the initiating holder or (z) the company exercises its rights of postponement, termination or withdrawal under section 3.1. -8- 3.4 expenses. the company shall pay all registration expenses in connection with a demand registration, whether or not such demand registration becomes effective. 3.5 underwriting procedures. if the company or the initiating holders holding a majority of the registrable securities held by all of the initiating holders so elect, the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such demand registration to be in the form of a firm commitment underwritten offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering shall be the approved underwriter selected in accordance with section 3.6. in connection with any demand registration under this article iii involving an underwritten offering, none of the registrable securities held by any designated holder making a request for inclusion of such registrable securities pursuant to section 3.2 hereof shall be included in such underwritten offering unless such designated holder accepts the terms of the offering as agreed upon by the company, the initiating holders and the approved underwriter (including execution of an escrow agreement and/or a power of attorney with respect to the disposition of the registrable securities), and then only in such quantity as will not, in the opinion of the approved underwriter, jeopardize the success of such offering by the initiating holders. if the approved underwriter advises the company that the aggregate amount of such registrable securities requested to be included in such offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the success of such offering, then the company shall include in such registration only the aggregate amount of registrable securities that the approved underwriter believes may be sold without any such material adverse effect and shall reduce the amount of registrable securities to be included in such registration, first as to the company and any holder of capital stock of the company who is not a designated holder, second as to the investors as a group, pro rata based on the number of registrable securities owned by each investor and third as to blackstone holders and wasserstein holders as a group, pro rata based on the number of registrable securities then owned by each. 3.6 selection of underwriters. if any demand registration, as the case may be, of registrable securities is in the form of an underwritten offering, the company shall select and obtain an investment banking firm of national reputation to act as the managing underwriter of the offering (the "approved underwriter"); provided, however, that the approved underwriter shall, in any case, also be approved by the initiating holders such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. -9- article iv incidental or "piggy-back" registration 4.1 request for incidental registration. if the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering by the company for its own account (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 or any successor thereto) (a "company offering") or for the account of any stockholder of the company other than the designated holders (each such stockholder, a "non-designated stockholder" and such offering a "non-designated stockholder offering"), then the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to each of the designated holders at least ten (10) business days before the anticipated filing date, and such notice shall describe the proposed registration and distribution and offer such designated holders the opportunity to register the number of registrable securities as each such designated holder may request (an "incidental registration"). the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters in the case of a proposed underwritten offering (the "company underwriter") to permit each of the designated holders who have requested in writing to participate in the incidental registration to include its or his registrable securities in such offering on the same terms and conditions as the securities of the company or the securities of such non-designated stockholders, as the case may be, included therein. in connection with any incidental registration under this section 4.1 involving an underwritten offering, the company shall not be required to include any registrable securities in such underwritten offering unless the designated holders thereof accept the terms of the underwritten offering as agreed upon between the company, such non-designated stockholders, if any, and the company underwriter (including execution of an escrow agreement and/or a power of attorney with respect to the disposition of the registrable securities), and then only in such quantity as the company underwriter believes will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the company. if the company underwriter determines that the registration of all or part of the registrable securities which the designated holders have requested to be included would materially adversely

possible: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies or which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; provided, however, that (x) before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the company shall provide counsel selected by the designated holders holding a majority of the registrable securities being registered in such registration ("holders' counsel") and any other inspector with a reasonably adequate and appropriate

registrable securities are sold, whichever is shortest, and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable any such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the registrable securities owned by such seller; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to (x) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this section 6.1(d), (y) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the company shall promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus and furnish to each seller of registrable securities a reasonable number of copies of such supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, after delivery to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (f) enter into and perform customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary

reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such registrable securities; (g) make available at reasonable times for inspection by any seller of registrable securities, any managing underwriter participating in any disposition of such registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement, holders' counsel and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by

its subsidiaries (collectively, the "records") as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the company's and its subsidiaries officers, directors and employees, and the independent public accountants of the company, to supply all information reasonably requested by any such inspector in connection with such registration statement. records that the company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies the inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the inspectors (and the inspectors shall confirm their agreement in writing in advance to the company if the company shall so request) unless (x) the disclosure of such records is necessary, in the company's judgment, to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in the registration statement, (y) the release of such records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom or (z) the information in such records was known to the inspectors on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the company or has been made generally available to the public. each seller of registrable securities agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the company and allow the company, at the company's expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the records deemed confidential; (h) if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten offering, cause to be delivered "cold comfort" letters dated the effective date of the registration statement and the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement from the company's independent public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort" letters as holders' counsel or the managing underwriter reasonably requests; (i) if such sale is pursuant

counsel rep- -14- resenting the company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the seller making such request, covering such legal matters with respect to the registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the underwriters, if any, and such seller may reasonably request and are customarily included in such opinions; (j) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than fifteen (15) months after the effective date of the

section 11(a) of the securities act and rule 158 thereunder; (k) cause all such registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed, provided that the applicable listing requirements are satisfied; (l) keep holders' counsel advised in writing as to the initiation and progress of any registration under article iii or article iv hereunder; (m) cooperate with each seller of registrable securities and each underwriter participating in the disposition of such registrable securities and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with the nasd; (n) make officers available to participate in customary road shows and other informational meetings as reasonably requested by any

precedent to the obligation of the company to include any registrable securities of any designated holder in a registration statement pursuant to this agreement that the designated holder shall furnish to the company such information regarding itself, the registrable securities held by it, any other securities of the company held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such registrable securities as shall be required to effect the registration of the registrable securities held by such designated holder, including, without limitation, all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the company by such desig- -15- nated holder not materially misleading or necessary to cause such registration statement not to omit a material fact with respect to such designated holder necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. any such information shall be provided to the company within any reasonable time period requested by the company. (a) each designated holder shall notify the company, at any time when a prospectus is required to be delivered under applicable law, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in the applicable registration statement, as then in effect, in each case only with respect to information provided by such holder, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing. such designated holder shall immediately upon the happening of any such event cease using such prospectus. 6.3 notice to discontinue. each designated holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 6.1(e) or 6.2(b), such designated holder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such registrable securities until such designated holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 6.1(e) and, if so directed by the company, such designated holder shall deliver to the company (at the company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such designated holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such registrable securities which is current at the time of receipt of such notice. if the company shall give any such notice, the company shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this agreement (including, without limitation, the period referred to in section 6.1(b)) by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to section 6.1(e) to and including the date when sellers of such registrable securities under such registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by and meeting the requirements of section 6.1(e). 6.4 registration expenses. the company shall pay all expenses arising from or incident to its performance of, or compliance with, this agreement, including, without limitation, (i) commission, stock exchange and nasd registration and filing fees, (ii) all fees and expenses incurred in

$35,000 and (vi) any liability insurance or other premiums for insurance obtained in connection with any demand registration or piggy-back registration thereon or incidental registration pursuant to the terms of this agreement, regardless of whether such registration statement is declared effective. all of the expenses described in the preceding sentence of this section 6.4 are referred to herein as "registration expenses." the designated holders of registrable securities sold pursuant to a registration statement shall bear the expense of any broker's commission, underwriter's discount or commission or transfer taxes relating to registration and sale of such designated holders registrable securities and, subject to clause (v) above, shall bear the fees and expenses of their own counsel. article vii indemnification; contribution 7.1 indemnification by the company. the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each designated holder, its partners, directors, officers, affiliates and each person who controls (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act) such designated holder from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) (each, a "liability" and collectively, "liabilities"), arising out of or based upon any untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading under the circumstances such statements were made, except insofar as such liability (i) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission contained in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus or final prospectus in reliance and in conformity with information concerning such designated holder furnished in writing to the company by such designated holder expressly for use therein, including, without limitation, the information furnished to the company pursuant to section 6.2, or (ii) is caused by any failure by the designated holder to deliver a prospectus or preliminary prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) as and when required under the securities act after such prospectus has been timely furnished by the company . the company shall also provide customary indemnities to any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers, directors and employees and each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the designated holders of registrable securities. -17- 7.2 indemnification by designated holders. each designated holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, any underwriter retained by the company, each of their respective officers, directors and affiliates and each person who controls the company or such underwriter (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to the designated holders, but only if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information with respect to such designated holder furnished in writing to the company by such designated holder expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus, including, without limitation, the information furnished to the company pursuant to section 6.2; provided, however, that the total amount to be indemnified by such designated holder pursuant to section 6.2 shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such designated holder in the offering to which the registration statement or prospectus relates. 7.3 conduct of indemnification proceedings. any person entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "indemnified party") agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the "indemnifying party") after the receipt by the indemnified party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which the indemnified party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this agreement; provided, however, that the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to the indemnified party hereunder (except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). if notice of commencement of any such action is given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and such parties have been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such indemnified party and the indemnifying party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party. in any of such cases, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemni- -18- fied parties. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of such indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is a party and indemnity has been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability for claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. 7.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article 7 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative faults of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding; provided that the total amount to be contributed by such designated holder shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such designated holder in the offering. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. -19- article viii covenants 8.1 rule 144. the company covenants that it shall (a) file any reports required to be filed by it under the exchange act and (b) take such further action as each designated holder of registrable securities may reasonably request (including providing any information necessary to comply with rule 144 under the securities act), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such designated holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or regulation s under the securities act or (ii) any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the commission. the company shall, upon the request of any designated holder of registrable securities, deliver to such designated holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 8.2 wasserstein and blackstone priority of sale. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this agreement, in the event of any offering of common stock, whether pursuant to a public offering, private placement or other exempt sale in which blackstone holders and/or wasserstein holders, on the one hand, and any other stockholder of the company (including, without limitation, any investor), on the other hand, desire or intend to sell common stock, blackstone holders and wasserstein holders, pro rata based on the number of shares of common stock then owned by each, shall have an absolute right to sell prior to the right of any other such holder. the foregoing rights of priority will not preclude the grant by the company of any demand or piggyback rights to any other person that do not conflict with the provisions of this agreement. article ix miscellaneous 9.1 recapitalizations, exchanges, etc. the provisions of this agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth herein with respect to (i) the shares of common stock, (ii) any and all shares of common stock of the company into which the shares of common stock are converted, exchanged or substituted in any recapitalization or other capital reorganization by the company and (iii) any and all equity securities of the company or any successor or assign of the company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) which may be issued in respect of, in conversion of, in exchange for or in substitution of, the -20- shares of common stock and shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, reverse splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date hereof. the company shall cause any successor or assign (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) to enter into a new registration rights agreement with the designated holders on terms substantially the same as this agreement as a condition of any such transaction. 9.2 no inconsistent agreements. the company represents and warrants that it has not granted to any person the right to request or require the company to register any securities issued by the company, other than the rights granted to the designated holders herein. the company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the designated holders in this agreement or grant any additional registration rights to any person or with respect to any securities which are not registrable securities which are prior in right to or inconsistent with the rights granted in this agreement. 9.3 remedies. the designated holders, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, shall be entitled to specific performance of their rights under this agreement. the company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. 9.4 notices. all notices, demands and other communications provided for or permitted

(b) if after the date hereof, there shall be any capital reorganization and the holders of all the outstanding shares immediately prior to such capital reorganization, after giving effect thereto, own in the aggregate at least a majority of the voting power of all classes of capital stock having the power to vote for the election of the directors of such surviving or transferee entity, (1) to the extent any property (other than common stock of such surviving or transferee entity) is received by such holders in connection with such capital reorganization, a distribution shall be deemed to have occurred consisting of such property and (2) the term "shares" shall be deemed to include such common stock as shall then be held by the new investors and the aggregate unrecovered base price shall be allocated to the number of shares of common stock received by the new investors. section 2.5 other adjustments. if the company shall, after the date hereof, distribute to the holders of the shares, cash, equity (other than shares) or other property or take any other similar action with respect to its shares, other than any action of a type otherwise described in this article ii, then the base price shall be adjusted to such extent, if any, and in such manner and at such time as is required to provide to the sellers with a profit participation interest that is economically equivalent with the profit participation interest held by the sellers prior to any such action. -4- section 2.6 adjustment rules.
