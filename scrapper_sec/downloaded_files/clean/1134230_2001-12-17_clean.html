or by which either of its assets or properties is bound or affected, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement or have a material adverse effect on the ability of either buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement. 5.4 consents, approvals, licenses, etc. no consent, approval, authorization, license, order or permit of, or declaration, filing or registration with, or notification to, any governmental entity or any other person or entity is required to be made or obtained by any buyer or any of its 15 affiliates in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) applicable requirements, if any, of the hsr act, (b) where failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or notification, either individually or in conjunction with other such failures, would delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement or have a material adverse effect on the ability of either buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement, or (c) notification to the federal competition commission (comision federal de competencia), and notification (post-closing) to the national registry of foreign investments (registro nacional de inversiones extranjeras). 5.5 purchase entirely for own account. each buyer understands that the subject stock, the preferred shares, the conversion shares and the common shares (the "securities") are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in the securities act based in part upon buyers' representations contained in the agreement. the preferred shares, the conversion shares and the common shares will be acquired for investment for the applicable buyer's own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and that buyers have no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. in acquiring the subject stock, no buyer is offering or selling, and will not offer or sell, for bhc in connection with any distribution of the subject stock, and neither of the buyers has a participation and will not participate in any such undertaking or in any underwriting of such an undertaking except in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws. neither of the buyers has any contract, undertaking, agreement, or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations to the person or to any third person, with respect to any of the securities. 5.6 disclosure of information. each buyer believes it has received all the information it considers necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to purchase the securities. each buyer further represents that it has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from bhc regarding the terms and conditions of the offering of the securities and the business, properties, prospects and financial condition of bhc. the foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and warranties of bhc in article iv of this agreement or the right of buyers to rely thereon. 5.7 investment experience. each buyer acknowledges that it is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of its investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the securities. each buyer also represents it has not been organized for the purpose of acquiring the securities. 5.8 restricted securities. each buyer understands that the securities it is purchasing are characterized as "restricted securities" under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from bhc in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations such securities may not be resold without registration under the securities act, except in certain limited circumstances. each buyer acknowledges and agrees that the preferred shares, the conversion shares and the common shares are subject to restrictions on transfer as set forth in section 7.13. 16

(and only by such amount, notwithstanding any values allocated to any of such capital stock or assets). in the event, and to the extent, that any such proceeds exceed $48 million in the aggregate, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, bhc shall be permitted to transfer such excess proceeds out of the fresh produce companies or otherwise retain such excess proceeds. to the extent

(d) without the written consent of savia, except as set forth herein, neither bhc's board of directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to savia, the approval or recommendation by such board of directors or any such committee of this agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve or recommend or propose to approve or recommend, any acquisition proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal. notwithstanding the foregoing, bhc's board of directors may (subject to the terms of this sentence and the following sentence) terminate this agreement in accordance with section 10.2(d) and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, in which event bhc may take any of the actions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, however, that bhc shall not enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal unless bhc shall have furnished savia with written notice not later than 12:00 noon two business days in advance of any date that it 27 intends to enter into such agreement and afford savia an opportunity to make a proposal that is superior to such superior proposal. article viii conditions to obligations of bhc 8.1 conditions to first closing. the obligations of bhc to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement to be consummated at the first closing shall be subject to the fulfillment on or prior to the first closing date of each of the following conditions: (a) representations and warranties true. all the representations and warranties of buyers contained in this agreement, and in any agreement, instrument, or document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith on or prior to the first closing date, shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the first closing date as if made on and as of such date, except as affected by transactions permitted by this agreement and except to the extent that any such representation or warranty is made as of a specified date, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such specified date.

conditions set forth in section 9.1 shall not have been satisfied and shall not have been waived by savia. 10.2 termination prior to the second closing. this agreement may be terminated with respect to the transactions contemplated by this agreement to be consummated at the second closing (subject to section 10.6) and such transactions abandoned at any time prior to the second closing in the following manner: (a) by mutual written consent of bhc and savia; (b) by either bhc or savia, if: (i) the second closing shall not have occurred on or before september 30, 2001 unless such failure to

superior proposal. 10.3 effect of termination. in the event of the termination of this agreement pursuant to section 10.1 or 10.2 by bhc, on the one hand, or savia, on the other, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this agreement shall become void and have no effect, except that the agreements contained in this section and in article xiii and sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.7 and 7.9 shall survive the termination hereof. nothing contained in this section shall relieve any party from liability for damages actually incurred as a result of any breach of this agreement. 10.4 amendment. this agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of all the parties hereto and duly approved by the special committee of the bhc board of directors comprised of independent directors; provided that this agreement may be amended only as may be permitted by

party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 10.6 second closing matters. it is the intent of the parties that the transactions contemplated by section 2.1, on the one hand , and by section 2.2(c), on the other hand, shall in appropriate circumstances be treated separately for purposes of articles viii, ix and x. by way of example, a party's termination of this agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated by section 2.1 shall not of itself terminate the parties' agreements with respect to the transactions contemplated by section 2.2(c). article xi tax matters 11.1 tax allocation: pre-closing. bhc shall be solely liable for and shall pay all federal income taxes of the fresh produce companies (and any costs or expenses connected therewith) due for all taxable years and periods ending on or before the second closing date (the "pre-closing tax period") and all other taxes for periods ending on december 31, 2000. bhc will include the taxable income or loss of the fresh produce companies on bhc's federal consolidated income tax returns for any pre-closing tax period to the extent required under treasury regulation section 1.1502-76(b). the taxable income or loss of the fresh produce companies for the taxable year that includes the second closing date will be apportioned up to and including the second closing date by closing the books of the fresh produce companies as of the second closing date pursuant to treasury regulation section 1.1502-76(b). bhc will prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all federal income tax returns for the fresh produce companies that are required to be filed with the appropriate governmental entities for any pre-closing tax period and all other taxes for periods ending on december 31, 2000; provided, however, that bhc shall furnish copies of such returns to savia for its review, at least 10 days prior to filing. 11.2 tax allocation: post-closing. savia shall be solely liable for and shall pay all taxes of the fresh produce companies (and any costs or expenses connected therewith) due for any taxable year or taxable period commencing after the second closing date (a "post-closing tax period"). savia will prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all tax returns for the fresh produce companies that are required to be filed with the appropriate governmental entities for any post-closing tax period. savia will make or cause to be made all payments shown thereon as owing with respect to any such tax returns. 11.3 [intentionally omitted.] 33 11.4 corporate records. section 7.1 shall apply with respect to the parties' access to tax information, except that notwithstanding section 7.1, savia shall preserve or cause to be preserved, and retain or cause to be retained, all returns, schedules, work papers, and all material records or other documents relating to any such tax returns until the expiration of the statutory period of limitations (including extensions) of the taxable periods to which such documents relate. any information obtained pursuant to this section 11.4 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of tax returns or claims for refund or in conducting any audit or other proceedings. 11.5 refunds or credits. except as otherwise set forth in this agreement, to the extent any refunds or credits with respect to taxes paid by the fresh produce companies are attributable to any pre-closing tax period, such refunds or credits shall be for the account of bhc. except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence, to the extent that any refunds or credits with respect to taxes paid by the fresh produce companies are attributable to any post-closing tax period, such refunds or credits shall be for the account of savia. to the extent that any refunds or credits with respect to taxes paid by the fresh produce companies are attributable to the straddle period described in section 11.3, such refunds and credits shall be for the account of the party who bears responsibility for such taxes pursuant to section 11.3. savia shall cause the fresh produce companies to forward to bhc or to reimburse bhc for any such refunds or credits for the account of bhc within 10 business days from receipt thereof by any of savia or the fresh produce companies. bhc shall forward to savia or reimburse savia for any refunds or credits for the account of savia within 10 business days from receipt thereof by bhc. to the extent any such refund or credit is properly includable in the taxable income of the initial recipient, the amount forwarded or reimbursed to bhc or savia, as the case may be, shall be reduced by a percentage of the amount of such refund or credit equal to the highest marginal federal income tax rate for the tax period in which the refund or credit is received. any refunds or reimbursements not made within the 10 business day period specified above shall bear interest from the date received by the refunding or reimbursing party at the prime rate. 11.6 contests. in the case of any audit, examination or other proceeding ("tax proceeding") with respect to taxes for which bhc is or may be liable pursuant to this agreement, the general provisions of section 12.5 shall apply, in addition to the following specific provisions. savia shall execute or cause to be executed powers of attorney or other documents necessary to enable bhc to take all actions desired by bhc with respect to such tax proceeding to the extent such tax proceeding may affect the amount of taxes for which bhc is liable pursuant to this agreement. bhc shall have the right to control any such proceedings, and, if there is substantial authority therefor, to initiate any claim for refund, file any amended return or take any other action which it deems appropriate with respect to such taxes. if requested by savia, bhc shall provide to savia an opinion in form and content reasonably acceptable to savia from counsel reasonably acceptable to savia that there is substantial authority for the position that bhc is taking with respect to such action, and savia need not and bhc shall not take such action until such opinion is delivered to savia. any tax proceeding with respect to taxes for a period which includes but does not end on the second closing date shall be controlled jointly by bhc and savia. by written notice to bhc, savia shall have the right to instruct bhc to forego proceedings with respect to one or more items for which bhc may be liable to indemnify savia. such notice shall constitute a waiver of the 34 right of savia to indemnification for any taxes arising out of such item for the period or periods involved, but shall not otherwise waive any rights of bhc under this section. article xii survival; indemnification 12.1 survival. (a) the representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in articles iv and v of this agreement or in any certificate, instrument, or document delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the first closing and the second closing, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any party, until the first anniversary of the second closing date (or the first closing date, if the second closing does not occur) (the "survival date"). (b) the provisions of this article shall have no effect upon any other obligation of the parties hereto under this agreement, whether to be performed before, at or after the first closing or second closing. 12.2 indemnification by bhc.

(b) the indemnification obligations of bhc pursuant to this article xii shall be subject to the following limitations and other provisions set forth herein: (i) no indemnification shall be required to be made by bhc with respect to any losses under this section 12.2 except to the extent that the aggregate amount of such losses incurred by savia (whether arising, asserted, resulting, imposed or incurred before, on or after the closing date) exceeds $250,000. (ii) no indemnification shall be required to be made by bhc with respect to any losses under section 12.2 to the extent that the aggregate amount of such losses incurred by savia (whether arising, asserted, resulting, imposed or incurred before, on or after the closing date) exceeds $5,000,000. 35 12.3 indemnification by savia. (a) subject to the terms and conditions of this article xii, savia shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless bhc and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives from and against any and all losses asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by bhc or its affiliates or any such other person, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any of the following: (i) the operation of the business of any fresh produce company, whether prior to or from and after the closing date, except to the extent savia is indemnified by bhc with respect to such matters pursuant to section 12.2; or (ii) the ownership or use of the dnap assets from and after the second closing date. (b) the indemnification obligations of savia pursuant to this article xii shall be subject to the following limitations and other provisions set forth herein: (i) no indemnification shall be required to be made by savia with respect to any losses under section 12.3 except to the extent that the aggregate amount of such losses incurred by bhc (whether arising, asserted, resulting, imposed or incurred before, on or after the closing date) exceeds $250,000. (ii) no indemnification shall be required to be made by savia with respect to any losses under section 12.3 to the extent that the aggregate amount of such losses incurred by bhc (whether arising, asserted, resulting, imposed or incurred before, on or after the closing date) exceeds $5,000,000. 12.4 further limitations of liability. the amount of any loss shall be reduced (i) to the extent that any person entitled to receive indemnification under this agreement (an "indemnitee") receives any insurance proceeds with respect to a loss, (ii) to take into account any net tax benefit recognized by the indemnitee arising from the recognition of the loss and (iii) to take into account any payment actually received by an indemnitee with respect to a loss. 12.5 defense of claims. (a) if any indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of the commencement of any claim, action or proceeding made or brought by any person or entity who or which is not a party to this agreement or an affiliate of a party to this agreement (a "third party claim") with respect to which indemnification is to be sought from a person required to provide indemnification under this agreement (the "indemnifying party"), the indemnitee will give such indemnifying party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 20 calendar days after the indemnitee's receipt of notice of such third party claim, provided the failure to give timely notice will not affect the rights or obligations of the indemnifying party except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the indemnifying party was substantially disadvantaged. such notice shall 36 describe the nature of the third party claim in reasonable detail and will indicate the estimated amount, if practicable, of the loss that has been or may be sustained by the indemnitee. the indemnifying party will have the right to participate in or, by giving written notice to the indemnitee, to elect to assume the defense of any third party claim at such indemnifying party's own expense and by such indemnifying party's own counsel, and the indemnitee will cooperate in good faith in such defense at such indemnitee's own expense. (b) if within 10 calendar days after an indemnitee provides written notice to the indemnifying party of any third party claim, the indemnitee receives written notice from the indemnifying party that such indemnifying party has elected to assume the defense of such third party claim as provided in the last sentence of section 12.5(a), the indemnifying party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that if the indemnifying party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such third party claim within 10 calendar days after receiving notice from the indemnitee that the indemnitee believes the indemnifying party has failed to take such steps the indemnitee may assume its own defense, and the indemnifying party will be liable for all reasonable expenses thereof. without the prior written consent of the indemnitee, the indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement of any third party claim which would lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of the indemnitee for which the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. if a firm offer ("firm offer") is made to settle a third party claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the indemnitee for which the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder and the indemnifying party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the indemnifying party will give written notice to the indemnitee to that effect. if the indemnitee fails to consent to such firm offer within 10 calendar days after its receipt of such notice, the indemnitee may continue to contest or defend such third party claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of the indemnifying party to such third party claim will be the amount of such firm offer, plus reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by the indemnitee up to the date of such notice. (c) any claim by an indemnitee on account of a loss which does not result from a third party claim (a "direct claim") will be asserted by giving the indemnifying party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, stating the nature of such claim in reasonable detail and indicating the estimated amount, if practicable, but in any event not later than 20 calendar days after the indemnitee becomes aware of such direct claim, and the indemnifying party will have a period of 30 calendar days within which to respond to such direct claim. if the indemnifying party does not respond within such 30 day period, the indemnifying party will be deemed to have accepted such claim. if the indemnifying party rejects such claim, the indemnitee will be free to seek enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this agreement. (d) if the amount of any loss, at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage or tax benefit, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other entity, the amount of such reduction, less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection therewith, will promptly be repaid by the indemnitee to the indemnifying party. upon making any indemnity payment, the indemnifying party will, to the extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnitee against any third party in respect of the loss 37 to which the indemnity payment relates; provided, however, that (i) the indemnifying party will then be in compliance with its obligations under this agreement in respect of such loss, and (ii) until the indemnitee recovers full payment of its loss, any and all claims of the indemnifying party against any such third party on account of said indemnity payment are hereby made expressly subordinated and subjected in right of payment to the indemnitee's rights against such third party. without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each such indemnitee and indemnifying party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination rights. nothing in this section 12.5(d) shall be construed to require any party hereto to obtain or maintain any insurance coverage. (e) in addition to the foregoing, section 11.7 shall also apply with respect to tax proceedings. 12.6 tax treatment of indemnity payments. each of the parties agrees to treat any payments made pursuant to this article xii, under any other indemnity provision in this agreement and for any misrepresentations or breach of warranties or covenants as adjustments to the purchase price for all federal and state income tax purposes. article xiii miscellaneous 13.1 notices. all notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted to be given or made hereunder by any
