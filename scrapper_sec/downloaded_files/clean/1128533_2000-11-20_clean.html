and the company will pay to each such holder, underwriter or controlling person, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.10(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such holder, underwriter or controlling person. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each holder will, if registrable securities held by him are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the act, any underwriter, of the company's securities covered by such a registration statement (if there by any such underwriter) any other holder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other holder, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this subsection 1.10(b), in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.10(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this subsection 1.10(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 1.10 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 1.10, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the -8- 9 parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. the omission to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnified party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 1.10. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 1.10 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. (f) the obligations of the company and holders under this section 1.10 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement under this section 1, and otherwise. 1.11 reports under securities exchange act of 1934. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144 promulgated under the act and any other rule or regulation of the sec that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on form s-3, the company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in sec rule 144, at all times after ninety (90) days after the effective date of the first registration statement filed by the company for the offering of its securities to the general public;
