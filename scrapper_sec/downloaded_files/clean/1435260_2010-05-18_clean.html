(ii) if the l/c issuer is a revolving lender or if it shall be illegal or unlawful for borrower to incur advances as contemplated by section 2.2(b)(i) above because of an event of default described in section 9.1(h) or (i) or otherwise or if it shall be illegal or unlawful for any revolving lender to be deemed to have assumed a ratable share of the reimbursement obligations owed with respect to any letter of credit obligation, then (a) immediately and without further action whatsoever, each revolving lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased from administrative agent (or such l/c issuer, as the case may be) an undivided interest and participation equal to such revolving lender&#146;s pro rata share (based on the revolving loan commitments) of the letter of credit obligations in respect of all letters of credit then outstanding and (b) thereafter, immediately upon issuance of any letter of credit, each revolving lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased from administrative agent (or such l/c issuer, as the case may be) an undivided interest and participation in such revolving lender&#146;s pro rata share (based on the revolving loan commitments) of the letter of credit obligations with respect to such letter of credit on the date of such issuance. each revolving lender shall fund its participation in all payments or disbursements made under the letters of credit in the same manner as provided in this agreement with respect to advances.

provided , however , that no lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from administrative agent&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. without limiting the foregoing, each lender agrees to reimburse administrative agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by administrative agent in connection with the preparation, execution, -75- delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this agreement and each other loan document, to the extent that administrative agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the loan parties. 10.7 successor administrative agent . administrative agent may resign at any time by giving not less than thirty (30) days&#146; prior written notice thereof to lenders and borrower. upon any such resignation, the requisite lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor administrative agent. if no successor administrative agent shall have been so appointed by the requisite lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the administrative agent&#146;s giving notice of resignation, then the administrative agent may, on behalf of lenders, appoint a successor administrative agent, which shall be a lender, if a lender is willing to accept such appointment, or otherwise shall be a commercial bank or financial institution or a subsidiary of a commercial bank or financial institution if such commercial bank or financial institution has combined capital of at least $300,000,000. if no successor administrative agent has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing, by the 30th day after the date such notice of resignation was given by the resigning administrative agent, such resignation shall become effective and the requisite lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of administrative agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the requisite lenders appoint a successor administrative agent as provided above. any successor administrative agent appointed by requisite lenders or administrative agent hereunder shall be subject to the approval of borrower, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that such approval shall not be required if an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing. upon the acceptance of any appointment as administrative agent hereunder by a successor administrative agent, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning administrative agent. upon the earlier of the acceptance of any appointment as administrative agent hereunder by a successor administrative agent or the effective date of the resigning administrative agent&#146;s resignation, the resigning administrative agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this agreement and the other loan documents, except that any indemnity rights or other rights in favor of such resigning administrative agent shall continue. after any resigning administrative agent&#146;s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this article x shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was administrative agent under this agreement and the other loan documents. 10.8 set-off and sharing of payments . in addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, each lender and each holder of any note or obligation is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice to any loan party or to any other person (except as provided in section 10.9(e) below), any such notice being hereby expressly -76- waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all balances held by it at any of its offices for the account of any loan party or any subsidiary of a loan party (regardless of whether such balances are then due to such loan party or such subsidiary) and any other properties or assets any time held or owing by that lender or that holder to or for the credit or for the account of any loan party or any subsidiary of a loan party against and on account of any of the obligations which are not paid when due. any lender or holder of any note or obligation exercising a right to set off or otherwise receiving any payment on account of the obligations in excess of its pro rata share thereof in accordance with the terms of this agreement relating to the priority of the repayment of the obligations shall purchase for cash (and the other lenders or holders shall sell) such participations in each such other lender&#146;s or holder&#146;s pro rata share of the obligations as would be necessary to cause such lender to share the amount so set off or otherwise received with each other lender or holder in accordance with their respective pro rata shares and in accordance with the terms of this agreement relating to the priority of the repayment of the obligations. each loan party agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (a) any lender or holder may exercise its right to set off with respect to amounts in excess of its pro rata share of the obligations and may sell participations in such amount so set off to other lenders and holders and (b) any lender or holders so purchasing a participation in the loans made or other obligations held by other lenders or holders may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers&#146; lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender or holder were a direct holder of the loans and the other obligations in the amount of such participation. notwithstanding the foregoing, if all or any portion of the set-off amount or payment otherwise received is thereafter recovered from the lender that has exercised the right of set-off, the purchase of participations by that lender shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored without interest. 10.9 no liability; return of payment; non-funding lenders; information; actions in concert . (a) no liability for advances . nothing in this agreement or the other loan documents shall be deemed to require administrative agent to advance funds on behalf of any revolving lender or to relieve any revolving lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that borrower may have against any revolving lender as a result of any default by such revolving lender hereunder. to the extent that administrative agent advances funds to borrower on behalf of any revolving lender and is not reimbursed therefor on the same business day as such advance is made, administrative agent shall be entitled to retain for its account all interest accrued on such advance until reimbursed by the applicable revolving lender. (b) return of payments . (i) if administrative agent pays an amount to a lender under this agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by administrative agent from borrower and such related payment is not received thereby, then administrative agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such lender on demand without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. -77- (ii) if administrative agent determines at any time that any amount received thereby under this agreement must be returned to borrower or paid to any other person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this agreement or any other loan document, administrative agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any lender. in addition, each lender will repay to administrative agent on demand any portion of such amount that administrative agent has distributed to such lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as administrative agent is required to pay to borrower or such other person, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. (c) non-funding lenders . neither the failure of any revolving lender to make any advance or purchase any participation required to be made or purchased by it in accordance with the terms of this agreement nor the status of any revolving lender as a non-funding lender shall relieve any other revolving lender (each such other revolving lender, an &#147; other lender &#148;) of its obligations to make such advance or purchase such participation on such date, but neither any other lender nor administrative agent shall be responsible for the failure of any non-funding lender to make an advance to be made, or to purchase a participation to be purchased, by such non-funding lender, and no other lender shall have any obligation to administrative agent or any other lender for the failure by such non-funding lender. notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, a non-funding lender of the type described in clause (a) of the definition thereof shall not have any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any loan document or constitute a &#147;lender&#148; or a &#147;revolving lender&#148; (or be included in the calculation of &#147;requisite lenders&#148; hereunder) for any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any loan document. (d) dissemination of information . administrative agent will use reasonable efforts to provide lenders with any written notice of default or event of default received by administrative agent from, or delivered by administrative agent to, any loan party; provided , however , that administrative agent shall not be liable to any lender for any failure to do so, except to the extent that such failure is attributable solely to administrative agent&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. administrative agent and lenders acknowledge that borrower is required to provide financial statements and other financial information and collateral reports to administrative agent and lenders in accordance with article v and agree that administrative agent shall not have any duty to provide the same to lenders. (e) actions in concert . anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, each lender hereby agrees with each other lender and with administrative agent that no lender shall take any action to protect or enforce its rights arising out of this agreement or any other loan document (including exercising any rights of set-off) without first obtaining the prior written consent of the administrative agent, it being the intent of -78- lenders that any such action to protect or enforce rights under this agreement and the other loan documents shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of administrative agent or requisite lenders. (f) affected lenders . if any lender (other than administrative agent, as a lender, or any of its affiliates or approved funds as lenders) (i) does not consent to a proposed loan modification requested by the borrower, which proposed loan modification is approved by at least the requisite lenders, (ii) is a non-funding lender, (iii) demands any payment under section 2.12 hereof, or (iv) is the cause of borrower having to pay any additional amount to such lender or any governmental authority pursuant to section 2.11 hereof (each relevant lender in clauses (i) through (iv) being an &#147; affected lender &#148;), then administrative agent or borrower, upon at least three (3) business days notice to such lender, borrower and administrative agent, may permanently replace the affected lender with one or more substitute lenders (each, a &#147; replacement lender &#148;). prior to the effective date of such replacement, the affected lender and each replacement lender shall execute and deliver an assignment and acceptance agreement, subject only to the affected lender being repaid, at par, its share of the outstanding obligations (including an assumption of its pro rata share of the letter of credit obligations). any replacement lender (other than an existing lender) (i) chosen by borrower shall be subject to the prior written approval of administrative agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) chosen by administrative agent shall, so long as no event of default shall be continuing, be subject to the prior written approval of borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. if the affected lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such assignment and acceptance agreement prior to the effective date of such replacement, the affected lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such assignment and acceptance agreement. the replacement of any affected lender shall be made in accordance with the terms of section 10.1 . until such time as the replacement lenders shall have acquired all of the obligations, the commitments, and the other rights and obligations of the affected lender hereunder and under the other loan documents, the affected lender shall remain obligated to make its pro rata share of the revolving loan and, to the extent applicable, purchase a participation in each letter of credit in an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the revolving loan commitments) of such letter of credit. 10.10 no reliance on administrative agent&#146;s customer identification program . each lender and administrative agent acknowledges and agrees that none of such lender, administrative agent and any of their affiliates, participants or assignees may rely on administrative agent to carry out such lender&#146;s, administrative agent&#146;s or their affiliate&#146;s, participant&#146;s or assignee&#146;s customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the usa patriot act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 cfr 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the &#147;

13.1 cross-guaranty . each loan party hereby agrees that such loan party is jointly and severally liable for, and hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to administrative agent and lenders and their respective successors and assigns, the full and prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of, all obligations owed or hereafter owing to administrative agent and lenders by each other loan party. each loan party agrees that its guaranty obligation hereunder is a continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, and that its obligations under this article xiii shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and unaffected by, -89- (a) the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability or any future amendment of, or change in, this agreement, any other loan document or any other agreement, document or instrument to which any loan party is or may become a party; (b) the absence of any action to enforce this agreement (including this article xiii ) or any other loan document or the waiver or consent by administrative agent and lenders with respect to any of the provisions thereof; (c) the existence, value or condition of, or failure to perfect its lien against, any security for the obligations or any action, or the absence of any action, by administrative agent and lenders in respect thereof (including the release of any such security); (d) the insolvency of any loan party; or (e) any other action or circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being agreed by each loan party that its obligations under this article xiii shall not be discharged until the payment and performance, in full, in cash of the obligations has occurred and all commitments have been terminated. each loan party shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as principal debtor with respect to the obligations guaranteed hereunder. 13.2 waivers by loan parties . each loan party expressly waives all rights it may have now or in the future under any statute, or at common law, or at law or in equity, or otherwise, to compel administrative agent or lenders to marshal assets or to proceed in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereunder against any other loan party, any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the obligations before proceeding against, or as a condition to proceeding against, such loan party. it is agreed among each loan party, administrative agent and lenders that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by this agreement and the other loan documents and that, but for the provisions of this article xiii and such waivers, administrative agent and lenders would decline to enter into this agreement. 13.3 benefit of guaranty . each loan party agrees that the provisions of this article xiii are for the benefit of administrative agent and lenders and their respective successors, transferees, endorsees and assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair, as between borrower, on the one hand, and administrative agent and lenders, on the other hand, the obligations of such other loan party under the loan documents. -90- 13.4 subordination of subrogation, etc . notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement or in any other loan document, and except as set forth in section 13.7 , each loan party hereby expressly and irrevocably subordinates to the prior payment in full, in cash, of the obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations for which no claim is outstanding) any and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off and any and all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until the obligations are indefeasibly paid in full in cash. each loan party acknowledges and agrees that this subordination is intended to benefit administrative agent and lenders and shall not limit or otherwise affect such loan party&#146;s liability hereunder or the enforceability of this article xiii , and that administrative agent, lenders and their respective successors and assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set forth in this section 13.4 . 13.5 election of remedies . if administrative agent or any lender may, under applicable law, proceed to realize its benefits under any of the loan documents giving administrative agent or such lender a lien upon any collateral, whether owned by any loan party or by any other person, either by judicial foreclosure or by non-judicial sale or enforcement, administrative agent or any lender may, at its sole option, determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without affecting any of its rights and remedies under this article xiii . if, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, administrative agent or any lender shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency judgment against any loan party or any other person, whether because of any applicable laws pertaining to &#147;election of remedies&#148; or the like, each loan party hereby consents to such action by administrative agent or such lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by administrative agent or such lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of subrogation which each loan party might otherwise have had but for such action by administrative agent or such lender. any election of remedies which results in the denial or impairment of the right of administrative agent or any lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any loan party shall not impair any other loan party&#146;s obligation to pay the full amount of the obligations. in the event administrative agent or any lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee&#146;s sale or at any private sale permitted by law or the loan documents, administrative agent or such lender may bid all or less than the amount of the obligations and the amount of such bid need not be paid by administrative agent or such lender but shall be credited against the obligations. the amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether administrative agent, any lender or any other party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the obligations guaranteed under this article xiii , notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which administrative agent or any lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale. -91- 13.6 limitation . notwithstanding any provision herein contained to the contrary, each loan party&#146;s liability under this article xiii (which liability is in any event in addition to amounts for which such loan party is primarily liable under section 2 ) shall be limited to an amount not to exceed as of any date of determination the greater of: (a) the net amount of all loans (plus all other obligations owing in connection therewith) advanced to any other loan party under this agreement and then re-loaned or otherwise transferred to, or for the benefit of, such loan party; and (b) the amount which could be claimed by administrative agent and lenders from such loan party under this article xiii without rendering such claim voidable or avoidable under section 548 of chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code or under any applicable state uniform fraudulent transfer act, uniform fraudulent conveyance act or similar statute or common law after taking into account, among other things, such loan party&#146;s right of contribution and indemnification from each other loan party under section 13.7 . 13.7 contribution with respect to guaranty obligations . (a) to the extent that any loan party shall make a payment under this article xiii of all or any of the obligations (other than loans made to that loan party for which it is primarily liable) (a &#147; guarantor payment &#148;) which, taking into account all other guarantor payments then previously or concurrently made by any other loan party, exceeds the amount which such loan party would otherwise have paid if each loan party had paid the aggregate obligations satisfied by such guarantor payment in the same proportion that such loan party&#146;s &#147; allocable amount &#148; (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such guarantor payment) bore to the aggregate allocable amounts of each of the loan parties as determined immediately prior to the making of such guarantor payment, then , following indefeasible payment in full in cash of the obligations and termination of the commitments, such loan party shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other loan party for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective allocable amounts in effect immediately prior to such guarantor payment. (b) as of any date of determination, the &#147; allocable amount &#148; of any loan parties shall be equal to the maximum amount of the claim which could then be recovered from such loan parties under this article xiii without rendering such claim voidable or avoidable under section 548 of chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code or under any applicable state uniform fraudulent transfer act, uniform fraudulent conveyance act or similar statute or common law. (c) this section 13.7 is intended only to define the relative rights of loan parties and nothing set forth in this section 13.7 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of loan parties, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall -92- become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this agreement, including section 13.1 . nothing contained in this section 13.7 shall limit the liability of any loan party to pay the loans made directly or indirectly to that loan party and accrued interest, fees and expenses with respect thereto for which such loan party shall be primarily liable. (d) the parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the loan party to which such contribution and indemnification is owing. (e) the rights of the indemnifying loan parties against other loan parties under this section 13.7 shall be exercisable upon the full and indefeasible payment of the obligations and the termination of the commitments. 13.8 liability cumulative . the liability of loan parties under this article xiii is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each loan party to administrative agent and lenders under this agreement and the other loan documents to which such loan party is a party or in respect of any obligations or obligation of any other loan party, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.
