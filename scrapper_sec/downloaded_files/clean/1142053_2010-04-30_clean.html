&#160; (b) no alfa affiliate shall be entitled to recover any amount under this section 8.3 unless and until the aggregate amount which the telenor affiliates are entitled to recover in respect of any claim for indemnification exceeds us$4,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any other currency), in which event the entire amount of such claims shall be recoverable;

(the &#8220;company&#8221;) &#160; for value received&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; [amount], i, [name of transferor] hereby sell, assign and transfer unto [transferee] of [address], [number and class] of shares of the company. &#160; dated this [&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;] day of [&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;], 20[&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;] &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; signed by: &#160; &#160; in the presence of: &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; transferor &#160; &#160; witness &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; transferee &#160; &#160; witness &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; 13.2 except as otherwise provided in these bye-laws, such instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and transferee, provided that, in the case of a fully paid share, the supervisory board may accept the instrument signed by or on behalf of the transferor alone. the transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of such share until the same has been registered as having been transferred to the transferee in the register of members. &#160; &#160; 13.3 if shares are certificated, the supervisory board may refuse to recognise any instrument of transfer unless it is accompanied by the certificate in respect of the shares to which it relates and by such other evidence as the supervisory board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 13.4 the joint holders of any share may transfer such share to one or more of such joint holders, and the surviving holder or holders of any share previously held by them jointly with a deceased member may transfer any such share to the executors or administrators of such deceased member. &#160; &#160; 13.5 the supervisory board may in its absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefor refuse to register the transfer of a share which is not fully paid. the supervisory board shall refuse to register a transfer unless all applicable consents, authorisations and permissions of any governmental body or agency in bermuda have been obtained. &#160; &#160; 13.6 the supervisory board may in its absolute discretion refuse to register the transfer of a share if the proposed transfer would not, if registered, comply with the terms of the shareholders agreement. &#160; &#160; 13.7 the supervisory board may in its absolute discretion refuse to register the transfer of a share if following the registration of such transfer, any such transferee would (directly or indirectly, by itself or together with its affiliates or a group of transferees which are controlled affiliates of the same controlling person) become a significant shareholder but such transferee has not become a party to the shareholders agreement prior to such transfer; provided that this bye-law shall not apply to a transfer where the transferee acquires shares in the market from a third party resulting in the transferee becoming a significant shareholder if the supervisory board determines that the transferor had no knowledge of the transferee&#8217;s intent to acquire such additional shares at the time of transfer. &#160; &#160; 13.8 if the supervisory board refuses to register a transfer of any share the secretary shall, within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the company, send to the transferor and transferee notice of the refusal. &#160; 14. foreign securities laws &#160; &#160; 14.1 the supervisory board may, in its absolute and unfettered discretion, decline to register the transfer of any shares if it believes that registration of such shares or transfer is required under the laws of any jurisdiction and such registration has not been effected, save that the supervisory board may request and rely on an opinion of counsel to the transferor or transferee, in form and substance satisfactory to the supervisory board, that no such registration is required. &#160; &#160; 14.2 the supervisory board shall have the authority to request from any direct or indirect holder of shares, and such holder shall provide, such information as the supervisory board may request for the purpose of determining whether any transfer contemplated by bye-law 14.1 should be permitted. &#160; 15. transmission of registered shares &#160; &#160; 15.1 in the case of the death of a member, the survivor or survivors where the deceased member was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased member where the deceased member was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the company as having any title to the deceased &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; member&#8217;s interest in the shares. nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by such deceased member with other persons. subject to the act, for the purpose of this bye-law, legal personal representative means the executor or administrator of a deceased member or such other person as the supervisory board may, in its absolute discretion, decide as being properly authorised to deal with the shares of a deceased member. &#160; &#160; 15.2 any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of any member may be registered as a member upon such evidence as the supervisory board may deem sufficient or may elect to nominate some person to be registered as a transferee of such share, and in such case the person becoming entitled shall execute in favour of such nominee an instrument of transfer in writing in the form, or as near thereto as circumstances admit, of the following: &#160; transfer by a person becoming entitled on death/bankruptcy of a member &#8212; ltd. (the &#8220;company&#8221;) &#160; i/we, having become entitled in consequence of the [death/bankruptcy] of [name and address of deceased/bankrupt member] to [number and class] share(s) standing in the register of members of the company in the name of the said [name of deceased/bankrupt member] instead of being registered myself/ourselves, elect to have [name of transferee] (the &#8220;transferee&#8221;) registered as a transferee of such share(s) and i/we do hereby accordingly transfer the said share(s) to the transferee to hold the same unto the transferee, his or her executors, administrators and assigns, subject to the conditions on which the same were held at the time of the execution hereof; and the transferee does hereby agree to take the said share(s) subject to the same conditions. &#160; dated this [&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;] day of [&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;], 20[&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;] &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; signed by: &#160; &#160; in the presence of: &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; transferor &#160; &#160; witness &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; transferee &#160; &#160; witness &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; 15.3 on the presentation of the foregoing materials to the supervisory board, accompanied by such evidence as the supervisory board may require to prove the title of the transferor, the transferee shall be registered as a member. notwithstanding the foregoing, the supervisory board shall, in any case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as it would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that member before such member&#8217;s death or bankruptcy, as the case may be. &#160; &#160; 15.4 where two or more persons are registered as joint holders of a share or shares, then in the event of the death of any joint holder or holders the remaining joint holder or holders shall be absolutely entitled to such share or shares and the company shall recognise no claim in respect of the estate of any joint holder except in the case of the last survivor of such joint holders. &#160; &#160; &#160; 16. mandatory offers &#160; &#160; 16.1 any person who, individually or together with any of its affiliates or any other members of a &#8220;group&#8221;, within the meaning of section&#160;13(d)(3) of the united states securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (a &#8220; section 13(d) group &#8221;) of which it is a part, directly or indirectly, in any manner, acquires beneficial ownership of any common shares or convertible preferred shares (including, without limitation, through the acquisition of ownership or control of another member or a controlling person of another member or through the direct or indirect acquisition of derivative securities) which, taken together with common shares or convertible preferred shares already beneficially owned by it or any of its affiliates or its section&# 160;13(d) group, in any manner, carry 50&#160;per cent. or more of the voting rights of the company (the &#8220; limit &#8221;), shall, within 30 days of acquiring such shares, make a general offer to all holders of common shares (including any common shares issued on the conversion of convertible preferred shares during the offer period) and convertible preferred shares to purchase their shares complying with bye-law 16.4. for the purposes of this bye-law 16.1, none of a nominating shareholder and its permitted transferees shall be deemed to form a section&#160;13(d) group with any other nominating shareholder or any of its permitted transferees, nor shall a party to the shareholders agreement be deemed to form part of a section&#160;13(d) group with any other party to the shareholders agreement solely by virtue of any such party&#8217;s rights and obligations under the shareholders agreement. &#160; &#160; 16.2 where any person breaches the limit and does not make an offer as required by bye-law 16.1, that person is in breach of these bye-laws. &#160; &#160; 16.3 the supervisory board may do all or any of the following where it has reason to believe that the limit is or may be breached: &#160; &#160; (a) require any member or person appearing or purporting to be interested in any shares of the company to provide such information as the supervisory board considers appropriate to determine any of the matters under this bye-law 16; &#160; &#160; (b) have regard to such public filings as it considers appropriate to determine any of the matters under this bye-law 16; &#160; &#160; (c) make such determinations under this bye-law 16 as it thinks fit, either after calling for submissions from affected members or other persons or without calling for such submissions; &#160; &#160; (d) determine that the voting rights attached to all shares held by such persons, or in which such persons are or may be interested (&#8220; relevant shares&#8221; ) are from a particular time suspended and incapable of being exercised for a definite or indefinite period and such person (and any proxy to the extent appointed by him to act in that capacity) shall for this period of time cease to be entitled to receive notice of any meeting of the members; &#160; &#160; (e) determine that some or all of the relevant shares will not carry any right to any dividends or other distributions from a particular time for a definite or indefinite period; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (f) take such other action as it thinks fit for the purposes of this bye-law 16 including: &#160; &#160; (i) prescribing rules (not inconsistent with this bye-law 16); &#160; &#160; (ii) setting deadlines for the provision of information; &#160; &#160; (iii) drawing adverse inferences where information requested is not provided; &#160; &#160; (iv) making determinations or interim determinations; &#160; &#160; (v) executing documents on behalf of a member; &#160; &#160; (vi) converting any relevant shares held in uncertificated form into certificated form, or vice-versa; and &#160; &#160; (vii) changing any decision or determination or rule previously made. &#160; &#160; 16.4 a general offer under bye-law 16.1 complies with this bye-law if: &#160; &#160; (a) the offer is unconditional in all respects and is open for acceptance for a period of not less than 30 days; &#160; &#160; (b) the making or implementation of the offer is not dependent on the passing of a resolution at any meeting of shareholders of the offeror; and &#160; &#160; (c) the offer is in cash or is accompanied by a cash alternative, in each case, at an offer price: &#160; &#160; (i) per common share not less than the greater of: &#160; &#160; (1) the highest price paid by the offeror, any of its affiliates or any member of its section&#160;13(d) group for any interest in common shares during the six months prior to the date on the limit was exceeded; &#160; &#160; (2) the 180 day volume weighted average price on the nyse of the common shares on the date on which the limit was exceeded; and &#160; &#160; (3) if, before the offer closes for acceptance, the offeror, any of its affiliates or any member of its section&#160;13(d) group acquires any interest in common shares at above the offer price, the highest price paid for the interest in the shares so acquired &#160; (the &#8220; offer price &#8221;); and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (ii) per convertible preferred share equal to the offer price less the conversion premium calculated in accordance with bye-law 4.3(d)(v). &#160; &#160; 16.5 the requirement for an offer to be made in accordance with this bye-law may be waived by a vote of a majority of members voting in person or by proxy at a general meeting, excluding for all purposes of the vote the member or members in question and their affiliates. &#160; &#160; 16.6 any one or more of the directors may act as the attorney(s) of any member in relation to the execution of documents and other actions to be taken for the sale of relevant shares determined by the supervisory board under this bye-law 16. &#160; alteration of share capital &#160; 17. power to alter capital &#160; &#160; 17.1 the company may if authorised by resolution of the members increase, divide, consolidate, subdivide, change the currency denomination of, diminish or otherwise alter or reduce its share capital in any manner permitted by the act. &#160; &#160; 17.2 where, on any alteration or reduction of share capital, fractions of shares or some other difficulty would arise, the supervisory board may deal with or resolve the same in such manner as it thinks fit including (without limitation) in the way prescribed in bye-law 17.3 below. &#160; &#160; 17.3 the supervisory board may sell shares representing the fractions to any person (including the company) for the best price reasonably obtainable and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due proportion amongst the persons to whom such fractions are attributable (except that if the amount due to a person is less than us$5.00, or such other sum as the supervisory board may decide, the company may retain such sum for its own benefit). to give effect to such sale the supervisory board may authorise a person to execute an instrument of transfer of shares in the name and on behalf of the holder of, or the person entitled by transmission to, them to the purchaser or as the purchaser may direct or implement any arrangements they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit in relation to the evidencing of title to and transfer of uncertificated shares. &#160; &#160; 17.4 the purchaser will not be bound to see to the application of the purchase moneys in respect of any such sale. the title of the transferee to the shares shall not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings connected with the sale or transfer. any instrument or exercise referred to in bye-law 17.3 shall be effective as if it had been executed or exercised by the holder of the shares to which it relates. &#160; 18. variation of rights attaching to shares &#160; &#160; 18.1 subject to the act and, if relevant, the approval required pursuant to bye-law 83 and save for a conversion of convertible preferred shares effected by a variation of rights pursuant to bye-law 4.3(d), all or any of the special rights for the time being attached to any class of shares for the time being in issue may, unless &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, from time to time (whether or not the company is being wound up), be altered or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of the issued shares of such class carrying 75&#160;per cent or more of all of the votes capable of being cast at the relevant time at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of shares of that class by a majority of the votes cast. &#160; &#160; 18.2 all the provisions of these bye-laws relating to general meetings of the company shall apply mutatis mutandis to any separate general meeting of any class of members, except that the necessary quorum shall be one or more members present in person or by proxy holding or representing at least 50&#160;per cent plus one share of the shares of the relevant class. &#160; &#160; 18.3 the special rights conferred on the holders of any shares or class of shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of such shares, be deemed to be altered or abrogated by (a)&#160;the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them, (b)&#160;the creation or issue for full value (as determined by the supervisory board) of further shares ranking as regards participation in the profits or assets of the company or otherwise in priority to them or (c)&#160;the purchase or redemption by the company of any of its own shares. &#160; dividends and capitalisation &#160; 19. dividends &#160; &#160; 19.1 the supervisory board may, subject to these bye-laws and in accordance with the act, declare a dividend to be paid to the members holding shares entitled to the payment of dividends, in proportion to the number of shares held by them, and such dividend may be paid in cash or wholly or partly in specie, including without limitation the issue by the company of shares or other securities, in which case the supervisory board may fix the value for distribution in specie of any assets, shares or securities. no unpaid dividend shall bear interest as against the company. the exact amount and timing of any dividend declarations and payments shall, subject to the requirements of the act, be determined by the supervisory board. &#160; &#160; 19.2 the supervisory board may fix any date as the record date for determining the members entitled to receive any dividend. &#160; &#160; 19.3 the company may pay dividends in proportion to the amount paid up on each share where a larger amount is paid up on some shares than on others. &#160; &#160; 19.4 the supervisory board may declare and make such other distributions (in cash or in specie) to the members holding shares entitled to distributions as may be lawfully made out of the assets of the company. no unpaid distribution shall bear interest as against the company. &#160; &#160; 19.5 except insofar as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any shares otherwise provide: &#160; &#160; (a) all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares in respect of which the dividend is paid, but no amount paid up on a share in advance of a call may be treated for the purpose of this bye-law as paid up on the share; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (b) dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares in respect of which the dividend is paid during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid. &#160; 20. power to set aside profits &#160; the supervisory board may, before declaring a dividend, set aside out of the surplus or profits of the company, such amount as it thinks proper as a reserve to be used to meet contingencies or for any other purpose. &#160; &#160; 21. method of payment &#160; &#160; 21.1 any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post directed to the address of the member in the register of members (in the case of joint members, the senior joint holder, seniority being determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members), or by direct transfer to such bank account as such member may direct. every such cheque shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to such persons as the member may direct, and payment of the cheque or warrant shall be a good discharge to the company. every such cheque, warrant or direct transfer shall be sent at the risk of the person entitled to the money represented thereby. if two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any shares any one of them can give an effectual receipt for any dividend paid in respect of such shares. &#160; &#160; 21.2 the supervisory board may deduct from the dividends or distributions payable to any member (either alone or jointly with another) by the company in respect of any shares all moneys (if any) due from such member (either alone or jointly with another) to the company on account of calls or otherwise. &#160; &#160; 21.3 any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share which has remained unclaimed for six years from the date when it became due for payment shall, if the supervisory board so resolves, be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the company. the payment of any unclaimed dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may (but need not) be paid by the company into an account separate from the company&#8217;s own account. such payment shall not constitute the company a trustee in respect thereof. &#160; &#160; 21.4 the company shall be entitled to cease sending dividend cheques and warrants by post or otherwise to a member if those instruments have been returned undelivered to, or left uncashed by, that member on at least three consecutive occasions, or, following one such occasion, reasonable enquiries have failed to establish the member&#8217;s new address. the entitlement conferred on the company by this bye-law in respect of any member shall cease if the member claims a dividend or cashes a dividend cheque or warrant. &#160; &#160; &#160; 22. capitalisation &#160; &#160; 22.1 the supervisory board may capitalise any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any of the company&#8217;s share premium or other reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution by applying such amount in paying up unissued shares to be allotted as fully paid up bonus shares pro-rata (except in connection with the conversion of shares of one class to shares of another class) to the members. &#160; &#160; 22.2 the supervisory board may capitalise any amount for the time being standing to the credit of a reserve account or amounts otherwise available for dividend or distribution by applying such amounts in paying up in full partly or nil paid up shares of those members who would have been entitled to such amounts if they were distributed by way of dividend or distribution. &#160; meetings of members &#160; 23. annual general meetings &#160; the annual general meeting of the company shall be held in each year (other than the year of incorporation) at such time and place as the ceo or the supervisory board shall appoint &#160; 24. special general meetings &#160; the ceo or the supervisory board may convene a special general meeting whenever in their judgment such a meeting is necessary. the supervisory board shall, on the requisition in writing of members holding such number of shares as is prescribed by, and made in accordance with, the act, convene a special general meeting in accordance with the act. each special general meeting shall, subject to the act and these bye-laws, be held at such time and place as the ceo or the supervisory board shall appoint. &#160; &#160; 25. notice &#160; &#160; 25.1 at least 30 clear days notice of an annual general meeting (other than an adjourned meeting) shall be given to each member entitled to attend and vote thereat, stating the date, place and time at which the meeting is to be held, that the election of directors will take place thereat, and as far as practicable, the other business to be conducted at the meeting. &#160; &#160; 25.2 at least 30 clear days notice of a special general meeting shall be given to each member entitled to attend and vote thereat, stating the date, time, place and the general nature of the business to be considered at the meeting. &#160; &#160; 25.3 the ceo or supervisory board may fix any date that is not more than 60 clear days prior to any general meeting as the record date for determining the members entitled to receive notice of and to vote at such general meeting. &#160; &#160; 25.4 a general meeting shall, notwithstanding that it is called on shorter notice than that specified in these bye-laws, be deemed to have been properly called if it is so &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; agreed by (i)&#160;all the members entitled to attend and vote thereat in the case of an annual general meeting; and (ii)&#160;by a majority in number of the members having the right to attend and vote at the meeting and together holding not less than 95&#160;per cent in nominal value of the shares giving a right to attend and vote thereat in the case of a special general meeting. &#160; &#160; 25.5 the accidental omission to give notice of a general meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a general meeting by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting. a member present, either in person or by proxy, at any annual general meeting or special general meeting of the holders of any class of shares shall be deemed to have received proper notice of that meeting and, where required, the purpose for which it was called. &#160; 26. giving notice and access &#160; &#160; 26.1 a notice or other document may be given by the company to a member: &#160; &#160; (a) by delivering it to such member in person; or &#160; &#160; (b) by sending it by letter mail or courier to such member&#8217;s address in the register of members; or &#160; &#160; (c) (excluding a share certificate) by transmitting it by electronic means (including facsimile and electronic mail, but not telephone) in accordance with such directions as may be given by such member to the company for such purpose or by such other means as the supervisory board may decide and which are permitted by applicable laws or regulations and not prohibited by the act; or &#160; &#160; (d) in accordance with bye-law 26.3. &#160; &#160; 26.2 any notice required to be given to a member shall, with respect to any shares held jointly by two or more persons, be given to whichever of such persons is named first in the register of members and notice so given shall be sufficient notice to all the holders of such shares. &#160; &#160; 26.3 each member shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that any notice or other document (excluding a share certificate) may be provided by the company by way of accessing them on a website instead of being provided by other means. &#160; &#160; 26.4 save as provided by bye-laws 26.5 and 26.6, any notice shall be deemed to have been served at the time when the same would be delivered in the ordinary course of transmission and, in proving such service, it shall be sufficient to prove that the notice was properly addressed and prepaid, if posted, at the time when it was posted, delivered to the courier or transmitted by facsimile, electronic mail, or such other method as the case may be. &#160; &#160; 26.5 notice delivered by letter mail shall be deemed to have been served 48 hours after the time on which it is deposited, with postage prepaid, in the mail of any member state of the european union, the united states, or bermuda. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 26.6 in the case of information or documents delivered in accordance with bye-law 26.3, service shall be deemed to have occurred when (i)&#160;the member is notified in accordance with bye-law 26.1 of the website posting; and (ii)&#160;the information or document is published on the website. &#160; &#160; 26.7 the company shall be under no obligation to send a notice or other document to the address shown for any particular member in the register of members if the supervisory board considers that the legal or practical problems under the laws of, or the requirements of any regulatory body or relevant stock exchange in, the territory in which that address is situated are such that it is necessary or expedient not to send the notice or document concerned to such member at such address and may require a member with such an address to provide the company with an alternative acceptable address for delivery of notices by the company. &#160; &#160; 26.8 if at any time, by reason of the suspension or curtailment of postal services within bermuda or any other territory, the company is unable effectively to convene a general meeting by notices sent through the post, a general meeting may be convened by a notice advertised in at least one national newspaper published in the territory concerned and such notice shall be deemed to have been duly served on each person entitled to receive it in that territory on the day, or on the first day, on which the advertisement appears. in any such case, the company shall send confirmatory copies of the notice by post if at least five clear days before the meeting the posting of notices to addresses throughout that territory again becomes practicable. &#160;

the register of members of the company in the name of the said [name of deceased/bankrupt member] instead of being registered myself/ourselves, elect to have [name of transferee] (the &#8220;transferee&#8221;) registered as a transferee of such share(s) and i/we do hereby accordingly transfer the said share(s) to the transferee to hold the same unto the transferee, his or her executors, administrators and assigns, subject to the conditions on which the same were held at the time of the execution hereof; and the transferee does hereby agree to take the said share(s) subject to the same conditions. &#160; dated this [&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;] day of [&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;], 20[&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;] &#160; &#160; signed by: &#160; &#160; in the presence of:

accompanied by such evidence as the supervisory board may require to prove the title of the transferor, the transferee shall be registered as a member. notwithstanding the foregoing, the supervisory board shall, in any case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as it would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that member before such member&#8217;s death or bankruptcy, as the case may be. &#160; &#160; 15.4 where two or more persons are registered as joint holders of a share or shares, then in the event of the death of any joint holder or holders the remaining joint holder or holders shall be absolutely entitled to such share or shares and the company shall recognise no claim in respect of the estate of any joint holder except in the case of the last survivor of such joint holders. &#160; 16. mandatory offers &#160; &#160; 16.1 any person who, individually or together with any of its affiliates or any other members of a &#8220;group&#8221;,

any manner, acquires beneficial ownership of any common shares or convertible preferred shares (including, without limitation, through the acquisition of ownership or control of another member or a controlling person of another member or through the direct or indirect acquisition of derivative securities) which, taken together with common shares or convertible preferred shares already beneficially owned by it or any of its affiliates or its section&# 160;13(d) group, in any manner, carry 50&#160;per cent or more of the voting rights of the company (the &#8220; limit &#8221;), shall, within 30 days of &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 95 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; acquiring such shares, make a general offer to all holders of common shares (including any common shares issued on the conversion of convertible preferred shares during the offer period) and convertible preferred shares. for the purposes of this bye-law 16.1, none of a nominating shareholder and its permitted transferees shall be deemed to form a section&#160;13(d) group with any other nominating shareholder or any of its permitted transferees, nor shall a party to the shareholders agreement be deemed to form part of a section&#160;13(d) group with any other party to the shareholders agreement solely by virtue of any such party&#8217;s rights and obligations under the shareholders agreement. &#160; &#160; 16.2 where any person breaches the limit and does not make an offer as required by bye-law 16.1, that person is in breach of these bye-laws. &#160; &#160; 16.3 the supervisory board may do all or any of the following where it has reason to believe that the limit is or may be breached: &#160; &#160; (a) require any member or person appearing or purporting to be interested in any shares of the company to provide such information as the supervisory board considers appropriate to determine any of the matters under this bye-law 16; &#160; &#160; (b) have regard to such public filings as it considers appropriate to determine any of the matters under this bye-law 16; &#160; &#160; (c) make such determinations under this bye-law 16 as it thinks fit, either after calling for submissions from affected members or other persons or without calling for such submissions; &#160; &#160; (d) determine that the voting rights attached to all shares held by such persons, or in which such persons are or may be interested (&#8220; relevant shares&#8221; ) are from a particular time suspended and incapable of being exercised for a definite or indefinite period and such person (and any proxy to the extent appointed by him to act in that capacity) shall for this period of time cease to be entitled to receive notice of any meeting of the members; &#160; &#160; (e) determine that some or all of the relevant shares will not carry any right to any dividends or other distributions from a particular time for a definite or indefinite period; and &#160; &#160; (f) take such other action as it thinks fit for the purposes of this bye-law 16 including: &#160; &#160; (i) prescribing rules (not inconsistent with this bye-law 16); &#160; &#160; (ii) setting deadlines for the provision of information; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 96 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (iii) drawing adverse inferences where information requested is not provided; &#160; &#160; (iv) making determinations or interim determinations; &#160; &#160; (v) executing documents on behalf of a member; &#160; &#160; (vi) converting any relevant shares held in uncertificated form into certificated form, or vice-versa; and &#160; &#160; (vii) changing any decision or determination or rule previously made. &#160; &#160; 16.4 a general offer under bye-law 16.1 complies with this bye-law if: &#160; &#160; (a) the offer is unconditional in all respects and is open for acceptance for a period of not less than 30 days; &#160; &#160; (b) the making or implementation of the offer is not dependent on the passing of a resolution at any meeting of shareholders of the offeror; and &#160; &#160; (c) the offer is in cash or is accompanied by a cash alternative, in each case, at an offer price: &#160; &#160; (i) per common share not less than the greater of: &#160; &#160; (1) the highest price paid by the offeror, any of its affiliates or any member of its section&#160;13(d) group for any interest in common shares during the six months prior to the date on the limit was exceeded, &#160; &#160; (2) the 180 day volume weighted average price on the nyse of the common shares on the date on which the limit was exceeded, and &#160; &#160; (3) if, before the offer closes for acceptance, the offeror, any of its affiliates or any member of its section&#160;13(d) group acquires any interest in common shares at above the offer price, the highest price paid for the interest in the common shares so acquired, &#160; (the &#8220; offer price &#8221;); and &#160; &#160; (ii) per convertible preferred share equal to the offer price less the conversion premium calculated in accordance with bye-law 4.3(d)(v). &#160; &#160; 16.5 the requirement for an offer to be made in accordance with this bye-law may be waived by a vote of a majority of members voting in person or by proxy at a general meeting, excluding for all purposes of the vote the member or members in question and their affiliates. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 97 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 16.6 any one or more of the directors may act as the attorney(s) of any member in relation to the execution of documents and other actions to be taken for the sale of relevant shares determined by the supervisory board under this bye-law 16. &#160; alteration of share capital &#160; 17. power to alter capital &#160; &#160; 17.1 the company may if authorised by resolution of the members increase, divide, consolidate, subdivide, change the currency denomination of, diminish or otherwise alter or reduce its share capital in any manner permitted by the act. &#160; &#160; 17.2 where, on any alteration or reduction of share capital, fractions of shares or some other difficulty would arise, the supervisory board may deal with or resolve the same in such manner as it thinks fit including (without limitation) in the way prescribed in bye-law 17.3 below. &#160; &#160; 17.3 the supervisory board may sell shares representing the fractions to any person (including the company) for the best price reasonably obtainable and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due proportion amongst the persons to whom such fractions are attributable (except that if the amount due to a person is less than us$5.00, or such other sum as the supervisory board may decide, the company may retain such sum for its own benefit). to give effect to such sale the supervisory board may authorise a person to execute an instrument of transfer of shares in the name and on behalf of the holder of, or the person entitled by transmission to, them to the purchaser or as the purchaser may direct or implement any arrangements they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit in relation to the evidencing of title to and transfer of uncertificated shares. &#160; &#160; 17.4 the purchaser will not be bound to see to the application of the purchase moneys in respect of any such sale. the title of the transferee to the shares shall not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings connected with the sale or transfer. any instrument or exercise referred to in bye-law 17.3 shall be effective as if it had been executed or exercised by the holder of the shares to which it relates. &#160; 18. variation of rights attaching to shares &#160; &#160; 18.1 subject to the act and, if relevant, the approval required pursuant to bye-law 79 and save for a conversion of convertible preferred shares effected by a variation of rights pursuant to bye-law 4.3(d), all or any of the special rights for the time being attached to any class of shares for the time being in issue may, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, from time to time (whether or not the company is being wound up), be altered or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 98 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; the issued shares of such class carrying 75&#160;per cent or more of all of the votes capable of being cast at the relevant time at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of shares of that class by a majority of the votes cast. &#160; &#160; 18.2 all the provisions of these bye-laws relating to general meetings of the company shall apply mutatis mutandis to any separate general meeting of any class of members, except that the necessary quorum shall be one or more members present in person or by proxy holding or representing at least one third of the shares of the relevant class. &#160; &#160; 18.3 the special rights conferred on the holders of any shares or class of shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of such shares, be deemed to be altered or abrogated by (a)&#160;the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them, (b)&#160;the creation or issue for full value (as determined by the supervisory board) of further shares ranking as regards participation in the profits or assets of the company or otherwise in priority to them or (c)&#160;the purchase or redemption by the company of any of its own shares. &#160; dividends and capitalisation &#160; 19. dividends &#160; &#160; 19.1 the supervisory board may, subject to these bye-laws and in accordance with the act, declare a dividend to be paid to the members holding shares entitled to the payment of dividends, in proportion to the number of shares held by them, and such dividend may be paid in cash or wholly or partly in specie, including without limitation the issue by the company of shares or other securities, in which case the supervisory board may fix the value for distribution in specie of any assets, shares or securities. no unpaid dividend shall bear interest as against the company. the exact amount and timing of any dividend declarations and payments shall, subject to the requirements of the act, be determined by the supervisory board. &#160; &#160; 19.2 the supervisory board may fix any date as the record date for determining the members entitled to receive any dividend. &#160; &#160; 19.3 the company may pay dividends in proportion to the amount paid up on each share where a larger amount is paid up on some shares than on others. &#160; &#160; 19.4 the supervisory board may declare and make such other distributions (in cash or in specie) to the members holding shares entitled to distributions as may be lawfully made out of the assets of the company. no unpaid distribution shall bear interest as against the company. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 99 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 19.5 except insofar as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any shares otherwise provide: &#160; &#160; (a) all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares in respect of which the dividend is paid, but no amount paid up on a share in advance of a call may be treated for the purpose of this bye-law as paid up on the share; and &#160; &#160; (b) dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares in respect of which the dividend is paid during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid. &#160; 20. power to set aside profits &#160; the supervisory board may, before declaring a dividend, set aside out of the surplus or profits of the company, such amount as it thinks proper as a reserve to be used to meet contingencies or for any other purpose. &#160; &#160; 21. method of payment &#160; &#160; 21.1 any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post directed to the address of the member in the register of members (in the case of joint members, the senior joint holder, seniority being determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members), or by direct transfer to such bank account as such member may direct. every such cheque shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to such persons as the member may direct, and payment of the cheque or warrant shall be a good discharge to the company. every such cheque, warrant or direct transfer shall be sent at the risk of the person entitled to the money represented thereby. if two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any shares any one of them can give an effectual receipt for any dividend paid in respect of such shares. &#160; &#160; 21.2 the supervisory board may deduct from the dividends or distributions payable to any member (either alone or jointly with another) by the company in respect of any shares all moneys (if any) due from such member (either alone or jointly with another) to the company on account of calls or otherwise. &#160; &#160; 21.3 any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share which has remained unclaimed for seven years from the date when it became due for payment shall, if the supervisory board so resolves, be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the company. the payment of any unclaimed dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may (but need not) be paid by the company into an account separate from the company&#8217;s own account. such payment shall not constitute the company a trustee in respect thereof. &#160; &#160; 21.4 the company shall be entitled to cease sending dividend cheques and warrants by post or otherwise to a member if those instruments have been returned &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 100 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; undelivered to, or left uncashed by, that member on at least three consecutive occasions, or, following one such occasion, reasonable enquiries have failed to establish the member&#8217;s new address. the entitlement conferred on the company by this bye-law in respect of any member shall cease if the member claims a dividend or cashes a dividend cheque or warrant. &#160; 22. capitalisation &#160; &#160; 22.1 the supervisory board may capitalise any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any of the company&#8217;s share premium or other reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution by applying such amount in paying up unissued shares to be allotted as fully paid up bonus shares pro-rata (except in connection with the conversion of shares of one class to shares of another class) to the members. &#160; &#160; 22.2 the supervisory board may capitalise any amount for the time being standing to the credit of a reserve account or amounts otherwise available for dividend or distribution by applying such amounts in paying up in full partly or nil paid up shares of those members who would have been entitled to such amounts if they were distributed by way of dividend or distribution. &#160; meetings of members &#160; 23. annual general meetings &#160; the annual general meeting of the company shall be held in each year (other than the year of incorporation) at such time and place as the ceo or the supervisory board shall appoint. &#160; &#160; 24. special general meetings &#160; the ceo or the supervisory board may convene a special general meeting whenever in their judgment such a meeting is necessary. the supervisory board shall, on the requisition in writing of members holding such number of shares as is prescribed by, and made in accordance with, the act, convene a special general meeting in accordance with the act. each special general meeting shall, subject to the act and these bye-laws, be held at such time and place as the ceo or the supervisory board shall appoint. &#160; &#160; 25. notice &#160; &#160; 25.1 at least 30 clear days notice of an annual general meeting (other than an adjourned meeting) shall be given to each member entitled to attend and vote thereat, stating the date, place and time at which the meeting is to be held, that the election of directors will take place thereat, and as far as practicable, the other business to be conducted at the meeting. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 101 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 25.2 at least 30 clear days notice of a special general meeting shall be given to each member entitled to attend and vote thereat, stating the date, time, place and the general nature of the business to be considered at the meeting. &#160; &#160; 25.3 the ceo or supervisory board may fix any date that is not more than 60 clear days prior to any general meeting as the record date for determining the members entitled to receive notice of and to vote at such general meeting. &#160; &#160; 25.4 a general meeting shall, notwithstanding that it is called on shorter notice than that specified in these bye-laws, be deemed to have been properly called if it is so agreed by (i)&#160;all the members entitled to attend and vote thereat in the case of an annual general meeting; and (ii)&#160;by a majority in number of the members having the right to attend and vote at the meeting and together holding not less than 95&#160;per cent in nominal value of the shares giving a right to attend and vote thereat in the case of a special general meeting. &#160; &#160; 25.5 the accidental omission to give notice of a general meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a general meeting by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting. a member present, either in person or by proxy, at any annual general meeting or special general meeting of the holders of any class of shares shall be deemed to have received proper notice of that meeting and, where required, the purpose for which it was called. &#160; 26. giving notice and access &#160; &#160; 26.1 a notice or other document may be given by the company to a member: &#160; &#160; (a) by delivering it to such member in person; or &#160; &#160; (b) by sending it by letter mail or courier to such member&#8217;s address in the register of members; or &#160; &#160; (c) (excluding a share certificate) by transmitting it by electronic means (including facsimile and electronic mail, but not telephone) in accordance with such directions as may be given by such member to the company for such purpose or by such other means as the supervisory board may decide and which are permitted by applicable laws or regulations and not prohibited by the act; or &#160; &#160; (d) in accordance with bye-law 26.3. &#160; &#160; 26.2 any notice required to be given to a member shall, with respect to any shares held jointly by two or more persons, be given to whichever of such persons is named first in the register of members and notice so given shall be sufficient notice to all the holders of such shares. &#160; &#160; 26.3 each member shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that any notice or other document (excluding a share certificate) may be provided by the company by way of accessing them on a website instead of being provided by other means. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 102 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 26.4 save as provided by bye-laws 26.5 and 26.6, any notice shall be deemed to have been served at the time when the same would be delivered in the ordinary course of transmission and, in proving such service, it shall be sufficient to prove that the notice was properly addressed and prepaid, if posted, at the time when it was posted, delivered to the courier or transmitted by facsimile, electronic mail, or such other method as the case may be. &#160; &#160; 26.5 notice delivered by letter mail shall be deemed to have been served 48 hours after the time on which it is deposited, with postage prepaid, in the mail of any member state of the european union, the united states, or bermuda. &#160; &#160; 26.6 in the case of information or documents delivered in accordance with bye-law 26.3, service shall be deemed to have occurred when (i)&#160;the member is notified in accordance with bye-law 26.1 of the website posting; and (ii)&#160;the information or document is published on the website. &#160; &#160; 26.7 the company shall be under no obligation to send a notice or other document to the address shown for any particular member in the register of members if the supervisory board considers that the legal or practical problems under the laws of, or the requirements of any regulatory body or relevant stock exchange in, the territory in which that address is situated are such that it is necessary or expedient not to send the notice or document concerned to such member at such address and may require a member with such an address to provide the company with an alternative acceptable address for delivery of notices by the company. &#160; &#160; 26.8 if at any time, by reason of the suspension or curtailment of postal services within bermuda or any other territory, the company is unable effectively to convene a general meeting by notices sent through the post, a general meeting may be convened by a notice advertised in at least one

more standing representatives by delivery to the registered office (or at such other place as the supervisory board may from time to time specify for such purpose) of evidence of such appointment(s).

instrument or other form of communication effecting or evidencing such an appointment by substitution. &#160; &#160; 34.7 the appointment of a proxy, whether a standing proxy or a proxy relating to a particular meeting, shall be deemed, unless the contrary is stated, to confer authority to vote on any amendment of a resolution and on any other resolution put to a meeting for which it is valid in such manner as the proxy thinks fit. &#160; &#160; 34.8 a vote given by proxy, whether a standing proxy or a proxy relating to a particular meeting, shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the principal, or revocation of the appointment of the proxy or of the authority under which it was executed, unless notice of such death, insanity or revocation was received by the company at the registered office (or at any other place as may be specified for the delivery of instruments or other forms of communication appointing or evidencing the appointment of proxies in the notice convening the meeting or in any other information sent to members by or on behalf of the supervisory board in relation to the meeting) at least one hour before the commencement of the meeting

case, to treat an instrument or other form of communication appointing or evidencing the appointment of a proxy or a corporate representative as properly delivered for the purposes of these bye-laws if a copy or facsimile image of the instrument is sent by electronic means to the registered office (or to such place as may be specified in the notice convening the meeting or in any notice of any

evidencing the appointment of a proxy or a corporate representative or any ancillary matter (including, without limitation, any requirement for the production or delivery of any instrument or other communication to any particular place or by any particular time or in any particular way) and, in any case in which it considers it appropriate, may accept such verbal or other assurances as it thinks fit as to the right of any person to attend and vote on behalf of any member at any general meeting. &#160; &#160; 34.11 a member who is the holder of two or more shares may appoint more than one proxy, with or without the power of substitution, to represent him and vote on his behalf in respect of different shares. &#160; &#160; 34.12 a proxy need not be a member. &#160; 35. representation of corporate member &#160; &#160; 35.1 a corporation which is a member may, by written instrument, authorise such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting and any person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which such person represents as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual member, and that member shall be deemed to be present in person at any such meeting attended by its authorised representative or representatives. &#160; &#160; 35.2 a member which is a corporation may, by written instrument, appoint more than one such authorised representative (with or without appointing any persons in the alternative) at any such meeting provided that such appointment specifies the number of shares in respect of which each such appointee is authorised to act as representative, not exceeding in aggregate the number of shares held by the appointor and carrying the right to attend and vote at the relevant meeting. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; vimpelcom ltd. &#160; page 109 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 35.3 notwithstanding the foregoing, the chairman of the meeting may

may adjourn the meeting to another time and place or sine die without such consent or direction, and whether or not a quorum is present, at the direction of the supervisory board (prior to or at the meeting) or if it appears to him that: &#160; &#160; (a) it is likely to be impracticable to hold or continue that meeting because of the number of members wishing to attend who are not present; or &#160; &#160; (b) the unruly conduct of persons attending the meeting prevents, or is likely to prevent, the orderly continuation of the business of the meeting; or &#160; &#160; (c) an adjournment is otherwise necessary so that the business of the meeting may be properly conducted. &#160; &#160; 36.3 unless the meeting is adjourned to a specific date, place and time announced at the meeting being

section&#160;5.1 indemnification . &#160; (a) to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify each holder, each of its officers, directors, partners and agents, and each person controlling such holder (within the meaning of section&#160;15 of the securities act), with respect to any registration, qualification, compliance or sale which has been effected pursuant to this agreement, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter (within the meaning of section&#160;15 of the securities act), against all expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance or sale, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation (or alleged violation) by the company of (i)&#160;the securities act, the exchange act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, (ii)&#160;the securities or similar laws of any state or other jurisdiction in which registrable securities are sold in an underwritten offering or (iii)&#160;if the registrable securities are sold in a non-underwritten offering effected pursuant to article ii, the securities laws of those jurisdictions in which the holders have requested registration or qualification of the registrable securities covered by the request (unless the company shall have notified such holder in a t imely manner that such registration or qualification is not available or has not been made for a reason permitted by the agreement), or in which the company has notified such holder that the registrable securities have otherwise been registered and qualified or are eligible for sale, in each case, applicable to the company in connection with any such registration, qualification, compliance or sale, and the company will reimburse or pay for the account of each holder, each of its officers, directors, partners and agents, each person controlling such holder, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred (as and when incurred) in connection with investigating, preparing the defense of or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company in writing by such holder, such controlling person or underwriter and stated to be specifically for use therein. &#160; (b) to the extent permitted by law, each holder will, if registrable securities held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify the company, each of its directors and officers, each underwriter, if any, of the company&#8217;s securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls the company or such underwriter (within the meaning of section&#160;15 of the securities act), and any other person participating in such registration, each of its officers and directors and each person controlling (within the meaning of section&#160;15 of the securities act) such person participating in such registration, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse or pay for the account of the company, such persons, such directors, officers, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred (as and when incurred) in connection with investigating, preparing the defense of or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company in writing by such holder and s tated to be specifically for use therein; provided , however , that the liability of such holder for indemnification under this section 5.1(b) shall not exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. &#160; 10 &#160; (c) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 5.1 (the &#8220; indemnified party &#8221;) shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the &#8220; indemnifying party &#8221;) promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), an d the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such indemnified party&#8217;s expense; provided further that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this agreement except to the extent that the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an indemnifying party&#8217;s ability to defend such action. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. &#160; (d) the obligations of the company and each holder under this section 5.1 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement pursuant to this agreement. &#160; (e) if a claim for indemnification under section 5.1(a) or section 5.1(b) is available by its terms but is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, then each indemnifying party in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of any such claim, loss, liability or action that otherwise would have been indemnified under section 5.1(a) or section 5.1(b), as the case may be, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the statements, omissions, actions or inactions that resulted in such claim, loss, liability or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party, any action or inaction by any such party, and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, omission, action or inaction; provided , however , that the liability of any holder under this section&#160;5.1(e) shall be limited to the amount of net proceeds received by such holder in the offering giving rise to such liability, less any amounts paid pursuant to section 5.1(b). the amount of such claim, loss, liability or action subject to this section 5.1(e) shall be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, liability or action (which shall be limited as provided in section 5.1(c) if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof). notwithstanding the foregoing in this section 5.1(e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section&#160;11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of written notice of the commencement or threatened commencement of any claims for which a claim for contribution may be made against an indemnifying party under this section 5.1(e) and if a notice for indemnification has not been otherwise given under this section 5.1, such indemnified party shall give written notice thereo f in the manner set forth hereunder for a claim for indemnification to the indemnifying party; provided , however , that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any obligation to provide contribution hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party&#8217;s ability to defend such action is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such timely notice. the parties acknowledge that determining contribution pursuant to this section 5.1(e) by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section 5.1(e) would not be just or equitable. for the avoidance of doubt, if indemnification is available under section 5.1(a) or section 5.1(b), the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the fullest extent provided in section 5.1(a) or section 5. 1(b) without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this section 5.1(e). &#160; 11 &#160; article vi &#160; information available &#160; the company, upon the reasonable request of each holder, shall make available for inspection by each holder, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to the registration statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by each holder or any such underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the company, and cause the company&#8217;s officers, employees and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by each holder or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the registration statement. &#160; article vii &#160; assignment of registration rights &#160; section&#160;7.1 assignment . neither this agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties and any attempt to do so will be void, except for assignments and transfers of the registrable securities in accordance with the terms of the shareholders agreement. this agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the parties and their successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of each holder. nothing in this agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this agreement, except as provided in this agreement. &#160; section&#160;7.2 obligations several and not joint . the obligations of the holders hereunder shall be several (and not joint). a holder shall not be responsible for the failure of any other holders to perform any obligation required to be performed by it hereunder. the obligations of the company at any time hereunder to each holders shall be separate and independent obligations. each holder shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this agreement as it shall see fit, and it shall not be necessary for any other holders to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes. &#160; article viii &#160; miscellaneous &#160; section&#160;8.1 effectiveness; termination; survival . this agreement shall take effect on the date hereof and shall terminate on the earlier of (a)&#160;the date on which all parties agree in writing to the termination of this agreement, (b)&#160;the cut-off date, if the closing has not occurred by 5:00&#160;p.m. gmt on such date in accordance with the share exchange agreement and (c)&#160;the date on which the share exchange agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the closing. any termination of this agreement pursuant to this section 8.1 shall be without prejudice to the

agreement. &#160; section&#160;8.2 holders . a person is deemed to be a holder of registrable securities whenever such person owns or is deemed to own of record such registrable securities. if the company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more persons with respect to the same registrable securities, the company shall act upon the basis of instructions, notice or election received from such record owner of such registrable securities. &#160; section&#160;8.3 notices . any notice, request, consent, waiver or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be effective only if it is in writing and personally delivered or sent by facsimile or sent, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by

under, relating to or in connection with, this agreement, in any manner whatsoever, whether in contract, in tort, or otherwise, and including any dispute or controversy regarding the existence,

directors or agents, on the one hand, against a party and/or any of its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors or agents, on the other hand, shall be settled by arbitration by a tribunal of three (3)&#160;arbitrators constituted and acting under the united nations commission on international trade law (uncitral) arbitr ation rules then in force (the &#8220; rules &#8221;) in accordance with the following terms and conditions: &#160; (i) in the event of any conflict between the rules and the provisions of this agreement, the provisions of this agreement shall prevail. &#160; (ii)(a) the seat of arbitration shall be london, england, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, and the fact that hearings are held elsewhere shall not affect the seat of arbitration; and (b)&#160;notwithstanding section 8.4, the arbitration proceeding itself shall be governed by the arbitration act 1996 of the united kingdom and the procedural law of england relating to the conduct of arbitration proceedings. &#160; (iii) the following procedures shall govern the selection of arbitrators: &#160; (a) where there is only one claimant party and one respondent party, the claimant party shall appoint one arbitrator in accordance with the rules, the respondent party shall appoint one arbitrator in accordance with the rules within thirty (30)&#160;days after the appointment of the first arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so appointed shall appoint the third (and presiding) arbitrator in accordance with the rules within thirty (30)&#160;days after the appointment of the second arbitrator. &#160; (b) in the event of an inability by the two party&#8211;nominated arbitrators to agree on a third arbitrator in accordance with section 8.5(a)(iii)(a) above, the appointing authority for the third arbitrator shall be the lcia (the &#8220; lcia &#8221;), acting in accordance with such rules as it may adopt for such purpose. the lcia shall use its best efforts to appoint such third arbitrator within thirty (30)&#160;days of an application being made for such purpose. &#160; (c) following the appointment by a claimant or claimants or a respondent or respondents of the first arbitrator in circumstances in which there is &#160; 13 &#160; more than one claimant party or respondent party, the remaining claimants or respondents, as the case may be, shall attempt to agree between or among themselves on the appointment of a second arbitrator within thirty (30)&#160;days after the appointment of the first arbitrator, and to appoint such individual to serve as the second arbitrator. should they (i)&#160;fail to so agree, and (ii)&#160;provide written notice of such disagreement within thirty (30)&#160;days of the appointment of the first arbitrator, then, within ten (10)&#160;days after the date of the first such notice, any such claimant or respondent may nominate a candidate to serve as the second arbitrator. within thirty (30)&#160;days after the end of such ten (10)&#160;day period for nominations, the lcia shall choose one of the candidates so n ominated to serve as the second arbitrator, in accordance with such rules as it may adopt for such purpose. the arbitration (including with respect to the appointment of the third arbitrator) shall thereafter proceed in accordance with this section 8.5. &#160; (iv) the english language shall be used as the written and spoken language for the arbitration proceeding and all matters connected to the arbitration proceeding. &#160; (v) the arbitral tribunal shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that it deems just and equitable and that is in accordance with the terms of this agreement, including specific performance, and including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, whether interim or final, and any such relief and any interim, provisional or conservatory measure ordered by the arbitral tribunal may be specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. each party to the arbitration proceeding retains the right to seek interim, provisional or conservatory measures in accordance with section 8.5(b), and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or constitute a waiver of the right to arbitrate. &#160; (vi) the award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on the parties to the arbitration proceeding. &#160; (vii) the award of the arbitral tribunal may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction and may be executed against the person and assets of the losing party in any competent jurisdiction. for the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that a court of any jurisdiction where the assets of a party against which enforcement is sought may be found is a court of competent jurisdiction, and the parties irrevocably consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in any such court. &#160; (b) except for arbitration proceedings pursuant to section 8.5(a), no action, lawsuit or other proceeding (other than proceedings for the confirmation or enforcement of an arbitration award, an action to compel arbitration or an application for interim, provisional or conservatory measures in connection with the arbitration) shall be brought by or between the parties in connection with any matter arising out of or in connection with this agreement. each party irrevocably waives any right under the arbitration act 1996 of the united kingdom to appeal any arbitration award to, or to seek determination of any question of law arising in the course of arbitration from, the commercial court. &#160; (c) in order to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related disputes, all claims between any of the parties that arise under or in connection with this agreement or any other transaction agreement may be brought in a single arbitration proceeding. upon the request of any party to an arbitration proceeding constituted under this agreement or any other transaction agreement, the arbitral tribunal shall consolidate the arbitration proceeding with any other arbitration proceeding relating to this agreement or any other transaction agreement, if (i)&#160;all parties concerned agree, or (ii)&#160;the arbitral tribunal determines that (a)&#160;there are issues of fact or law common to the proceedings so that a consolidated proceeding would be more efficient than separate proceedings, and (b)&#160;no party woul d be unduly prejudiced as a result of such consolidation through undue delay or otherwise. in the event of different rulings on the question of consolidation by the arbitral tribunal constituted hereunder and any other tribunal constituted under this agreement or any other transaction agreement, or where an order for consolidation is given but there is no agreement on which tribunal shall remain constituted to hear the matter, the following provisions shall apply. where the parties in the two proceedings are identical, the ruling of the arbitral tribunal constituted first in time shall control and such tribunal shall serve as the arbitral tribunal for the consolidated arbitration &#160; 14 &#160; proceeding. where the parties in the two proceedings are not identical, and subject always to clauses (i)&#160;and (ii)&#160;above, the ruling of the arbitral tribunal constituted first in time shall control, but a new arbitral tribunal for any consolidated arbitration proceeding shall be constituted in accordance with the provisions of section 8.5(a)(iii)(a). for the purpose of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal under that provision, and without prejudice to any party&#8217;s rights under applicable limitation period, the consolidated arbitration will be considered to have been commenced on the date of receipt by all the parties of the order of consolidation. the parties also expressly agree that any party to any other transaction agreement may, at the request of any party and with the consent of the pa rty to be joined and the arbitral tribunal, be joined as a party to any arbitration proceeding commenced under this agreement. &#160; (d) each party irrevocably appoints law debenture corporate services limited, located on the date hereof at fifth floor, 100&#160;wood street, london ec2v 7ex, united kingdom, as its true and lawful agent and attorney to accept and

the date of such service to the other party by facsimile in accordance with section 8.3. each party will enter into such agreements with such agent as may be necessary to constitute and continue th e appointment of such agent hereunder. in the event that any such agent and attorney resigns or otherwise becomes incapable of acting, the affected party will appoint a successor agent and attorney in london reasonably satisfactory to the other parties, with like powers. each party hereby irrevocably submits to (i)&#160;the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the commercial court in london, england in connection with any proceeding for the confirmation or enforcement of an arbitration award, and (ii)&#160;the exclusive jurisdiction of the commercial court in london, england in connection with any application for interim, provisional or conservatory measures in connection with an arbitration (in each case, as referred to in section 8.5(b) above) or an action to compel arbitration (provided that each party retains the right to file a motion to compel arbitration (or its equivalent) in a court other than the commercial court in london, england in response to an action commenced or a motion or application made by anot her party or its agents, affiliates or representatives in such other court). notwithstanding the foregoing, each party agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly, whether through any agent, affiliate, representative or otherwise, apply for any interim, provisional or conservatory measures in connection with an arbitration before any court located in the united states, the russian federation or ukraine; provided, however, that nothing in this section 8.5(d) shall preclude, in any manner whatsoever, any party from seeking any such measure based upon (a)&#160;any order or judgment, whether provisional or final, of any english court or (b)&#160;any order, directive, award or ruling, whether interim or final, of any arbitral tribunal in any arbitration proceeding hereunder. each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such action, suit or proceeding brought in the commercial court an d any claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in the commercial court has been brought in any inconvenient forum. nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against another party in any other jurisdiction in a manner not inconsistent with this section 8.5(d). &#160; (e) each party hereby represents and acknowledges that it is acting solely in its commercial capacity in executing and delivering this agreement and in performing its obligations hereunder, and each party hereby irrevocably waives, with respect to all disputes, claims, controversies and all other matters of any nature whatsoever that may arise under or in connection with this agreement and any other document or instrument contemplated hereby, all immunity it may otherwise have as a sovereign, quasi-sovereign or state-owned entity (or similar entity) from any and all proceedings (whether legal, equitable, arbitral, administrative or otherwise), attachment of assets, and enforceability of judicial or
