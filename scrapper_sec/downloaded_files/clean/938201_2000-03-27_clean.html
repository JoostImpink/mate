(b) if the registrable securities requested to be included in the piggyback registration by any holder differ from the type of securities proposed to be registered by the company and the managing underwriter advises the company that due to such differences the inclusion of such registrable securities would page 3 cause a material adverse effect, then (i) the number of such holders' registrable securities to be included in the piggyback registration shall be reduced to an amount which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, would eliminate such material adverse effect or (ii) if no such reduction would, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, eliminate such material adverse effect, then the company shall have the right to exclude all such registrable securities from such piggyback registration, provided, that no other securities of such type are included and offered for the account of any other person in such piggyback registration. any partial reduction in number of registrable securities of any holder to be included in the piggyback registration pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be effected pro rata based on the ratio which such holder's requested shares bears to the total number of shares requested to be included in such piggyback registration by all persons other than the company who have the contractual right to request that their shares be included in such registration statement and who have requested that their shares be included, subject to the senior piggyback registration rights and (if applicable) the investor rights agreement 30% right. if the registrable securities requested to be included in the registration statement are of the same type as the securities being registered by the company and the managing underwriter advises the company that the inclusion of such registrable securities would cause a material adverse effect, the company will be obligated to include in such registration statement, as to each holder only a portion of the shares such holder has requested be registered equal to the ratio which such holder's requested shares bears to the total number of shares requested to be included in such registration statement by all persons (other than the person or persons initiating such registration request) who have the contractual right to request that their shares be included in such registration statement and who have requested their shares be included, subject to the senior piggyback registration rights and the (if applicable) investor rights agreement 30% right. if the company initiated the registration, then the company may include all of its securities in such registration statement before any such holder's requested shares are included. if another security holder initiated the registration, then the company may not include any of its securities in such registration statement unless all registrable securities requested to be included in the registration statement by all holders are included in such registration statement. if as a result of the provisions of this section 2.02(b) any holder shall not be entitled to include all registrable securities in a registration that such holder has requested to be so included, such holder may withdraw such holder's request to include registrable securities in such registration statement prior to its effectiveness. section 2.03. shelf registration (a) holders of a majority of the registrable securities may, at any time after the first anniversary of the closing date (the "first anniversary"), make a written request that the company effect a shelf registration of a portion of the registrable securities held by such holders (the "shelf registration") pursuant to rule 415; provided, that a holder will be entitled to include in the shelf registration no more than 25% of the registrable securities held by such holder immediately after the closing date (giving effect to accretion of dividends as of such anniversary on such holder's registrable series e preferred stock and exercise, as of or prior to such anniversary, of such holder's warrants). upon receipt of a request for the shelf registration, the company shall promptly (but in any event within 10 days) give written notice of the proposed shelf registration to all other holders, and each such other holder shall have the right to include in the shelf registration up to 25% of the registrable securities held by such holder immediately after the closing date (giving effect to accretion of dividends as of such anniversary on such holder's registrable series e preferred stock and exercise, as of or prior to such anniversary, of such holder's warrants). (b) from and after the third anniversary of the closing date, holders of a majority of the registrable securities may make a written request that the company amend the shelf registration to include in the shelf registration no more than 50% of the registrable securities held by such holders immediately after the closing date (giving effect to accretion of dividends as of such anniversary on such holder's registrable series e preferred stock and exercise, as of or prior to such anniversary, of such holder's warrants). upon receipt of such request, the company shall promptly (but in any event within 10 days) give written notice of the proposed amendment to all other holders, and each such other holder shall have the right to include in the amended shelf registration up to 50% of the registrable securities held by such holder immediately after the closing date (giving effect to accretion of dividends as of such anniversary on such holder's registrable series e preferred stock and exercise, as of or prior to such anniversary, of such holder's warrants). from and after the fourth anniversary of the closing date, holders of a majority of the registrable securities may make a written request that the company amend the shelf registration to include in the shelf registration no more than 75% of the registrable securities held by such holder immediately after the closing date (giving effect to accretion of dividends as of such anniversary on such holder's registrable series e preferred stock and exercise, as of or prior to such anniversary, of such holder's warrants). upon receipt of such request, the company shall promptly (but in any event within 10 days) give written notice of the proposed amendment to all other holders, and each such other holder shall have the right to include in the amended shelf registration up to 75% of the registrable securities held by such holders immediately after the closing date page 4 (giving effect to accretion of dividends as of such anniversary on such holder's registrable series e preferred stock and exercise, as of or prior to such anniversary, of such holder's warrants). from and after the fifth anniversary of the closing date, holders of a majority of the registrable securities may make a written request that the company amend the shelf registration to include in the shelf registration up to 100% of the registrable securities held by such holders immediately after the closing date (giving effect to accretion of dividends as of such anniversary on such holder's registrable series e preferred stock and exercise, as of or prior to such anniversary, of such holder's warrants). upon receipt of such request, the company shall promptly (but in any event within 10 days) give written notice of the proposed amendment to all other holders, and each such other holder shall have the right to include in the amended shelf registration up to 100% of the registrable securities held by such holder immediately after the closing date (giving effect to accretion of dividends as of such anniversary on such holder's registrable series e preferred stock and exercise, as of or prior to such anniversary, of such holder's warrants). if a nonconsent event (as defined in section 5.10) shall have occurred, references in this paragraph to the "third anniversary of the closing date" shall mean the second anniversary of the closing date, references to the "fourth anniversary of the closing date" shall mean the third anniversary of the closing date and references to the "fifth anniversary of the closing date" shall mean the fourth anniversary of the closing date. (c) if the company's ability to amend the registration statement for the shelf registration to increase the number of registrable securities included therein (or to file a new shelf registration statement in respect thereof) in accordance with section 2.03 (b) is subject to any contractual limitations that could delay the company's ability to file or cause to become effective such registration statement, then, if requested by holders of a majority of the registrable securities, the company shall, in lieu of following the procedure set forth in section 2.03(b), file a single registration statement for the shelf registration (and cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the period set forth in section 3.01) that would permit the offering of such portion of the registrable securities (up to 100%) as may be requested by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities (it being understood and agreed that the holders of the registrable securities would not have the right to offer and sell from such shelf registration registrable securities other than in accordance with the schedule and amounts set forth in section 2.03(b) and that the company would have the right to take whatever measures necessary to ensure that such schedule was followed, including, without limitation the issuance of stop orders). article iii registration procedures section 3.01.filings; information. in connection with the registration of registrable securities pursuant to section 2.01, section 2.02 and section 2.03 hereof, the company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of such registrable securities as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in connection with any such request: (a) the company will expeditiously prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies and which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate and available for the sale of the registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such filed registration statement to become and remain effective (i) with respect to any demand registration or piggyback registration, for such period, not to exceed 60 days, as may be reasonably necessary to effect the sale of such securities, (ii) with respect to the shelf registration, until the earlier of the sale of all registrable securities thereunder and the eighth anniversary of the closing date (it being understood that if at any time all the registrable securities then permitted to be sold under such shelf registration pursuant to section 2.03 have been sold but the holders have the right to request the addition of additional registrable securities to the shelf registration in the future pursuant to section 2.03, the company may (at its option) either cause the registration statement to remain effective (notwithstanding the fact that all securities then registrable on such shelf registration statement shall have been sold) and to file post-effective amendments when required to permit the sale of the additional registrable securities or prepare and file, and cause to become and remain effective, a new shelf registration statement to effect the registration of the additional registrable securities when required pursuant to section 2.03); provided that if the company shall furnish to the selling holder a certificate signed by the company's chairman, president or any vice-president stating that the company's board of directors has determined in good faith that it would be detrimental or otherwise disadvantageous to the company or its shareholders for such a registration statement to be filed as expeditiously as possible because the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement or the disclosure of information in any related prospectus or prospectus supplement would materially interfere with any acquisition, financing or other material event or transaction which is then intended or the public disclosure of which at the time would be materially prejudicial to the company, the company may postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a period of not more than 120 days; provided that during any 360-day period page 5 the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to permit a period of at least 120 consecutive days during which the company will make a registration statement available under this agreement; and provided further that if (i) the effective date of any registration statement filed pursuant to a demand registration would otherwise be at least 45 calendar days, but fewer than 90 calendar days, after the end of the company's fiscal year, and (ii) the securities act requires the company to include audited financials as of the end of such fiscal year, the company may delay the effectiveness of such registration statement for such period as is reasonably necessary to include therein its audited financial statements for such fiscal year. if the company exercises its right to postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement, the applicable requesting holders shall be entitled to withdraw their request for such demand registration and it shall not count as a demand registration. (b) anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed that the company shall not be required to keep any shelf registration effective or useable for offers and sales of the registrable securities, file a post effective amendment to a shelf registration statement or prospectus supplement or to supplement or amend any registration statement, if the company is then involved in discussions concerning, or otherwise engaged in, any material financing or investment, acquisition or divestiture transaction or other material business purpose if the company determines in good faith that the making of such a filing, supplement or amendment at such time would interfere with such transaction or purpose. the company shall promptly give the holders of registrable securities written notice of such postponement containing a general statement of the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the anticipated delay. upon receipt by a holder of registrable securities of notice of an event of the kind described in this section 3.01(b), such holder shall forthwith discontinue such holder's disposition of registrable securities until such holder's receipt of notice from the company that such disposition may continue and of any supplemented or amended prospectus indicated in such notice. the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to permit sales of registrable securities on such shelf registration statement for at least 120 days during any 360-day period. in the event the company shall give notice of an event of the kind described in this section 3.01 (b), the company shall extend the period during which the applicable registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in section 3.01 (a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the date when the company shall give notice to the selling holders that such dispositions of such registrable securities may continue and shall have made available to the selling holders any such supplemented or amended prospectus. (c) the company will, if requested, prior to filing such registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to the selling holders, and each applicable managing underwriter, if any, copies thereof, and thereafter furnish to the selling holders and each such underwriter, if any, such number of copies of such registration statement, amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) and the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) as the selling holders or each such underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the registrable securities by the selling holders. (d) after the filing of the registration statement, the company will promptly notify the selling holders of any stop order issued or, to the company's knowledge, threatened to be issued by the commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered. (e) the company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to qualify the registrable securities for offer and sale under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the united states as the selling holders reasonably request; keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period in which such registration statement is required to be kept effective; and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable each selling holder to consummate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by such selling holder in such jurisdictions; provided that the company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph 3.01(e), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction. (f) the company will as promptly as is practicable notify the selling holders, at any time when a prospectus relating to the sale of the registrable securities is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an underwriter or dealer, of the occurrence of any event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and promptly make available to the selling holders and to the underwriters any such supplement or amendment. upon receipt of any notice of the occurrence of any page 6 event of the kind described in the preceding sentence, selling holders will forthwith discontinue the offer and sale of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such registrable securities until receipt by the selling holders and the underwriters of the copies of such supplemented or amended prospectus and, if so directed by the company, the selling holders will deliver to the company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the possession of selling holders, of the most recent prospectus covering such registrable securities at the time of receipt of such notice. in the event the company shall give such notice, the company shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in section 3.01(a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the date when the company shall make available to the selling holders such supplemented or amended prospectus. (g) the company will enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other actions as are required in order to expedite or facilitate the sale of such registrable securities. (h) at the request of any underwriter in connection with an underwritten offering the company will furnish (i) an opinion of counsel, addressed to the underwriters, covering such customary matters as the managing underwriter may reasonably request and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort letters from the company's independent public accountants covering such customary matters as the managing underwriter may reasonably request. (i) if requested by the managing underwriter or any selling holder, the company shall promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post effective amendment such information as the managing underwriter or any selling holder reasonably requests to be included therein, including without limitation, with respect to the registrable securities being sold by such selling holder, the purchase price being paid therefor by the underwriters and with respect to any other terms of the underwritten offering of the registrable securities to be sold in such offering, and promptly make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post effective amendment. (j) the company shall promptly make available for inspection by any selling holder or underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to any registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent or representative retained by any such selling holder or underwriter (collectively, the "inspectors"), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the company (collectively, the "records"), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the company's officers, directors and employees to supply all information requested by any such inspector in connection with such registration statement; provided, however, that unless the disclosure of such records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in the registration statement or the release of such records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction, the company shall not be required to provide any information under this subparagraph (j) if (a) the company believes, after consultation with counsel for the company, that to do so would cause the company to forfeit an attorney-client privilege that was applicable to such information or (b) if either (1) the company has requested and been granted from the commission confidential treatment of such information contained in any filing with the commission or documents provided supplementally or otherwise or (2) the company reasonably determines in good faith that such records are confidential and so notifies the inspectors in writing unless prior to furnishing any such information with respect to (a) or (b) such holder of registrable securities requesting such information agrees to enter into a confidentiality agreement in customary form and subject to customary exceptions; provided further, however, that each holder of registrable securities agrees that it will, upon learning that disclosure of such records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the company and allow the company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action and to prevent disclosure of the records deemed confidential. (k) the company shall cause the registrable securities included in any registration statement to be (a) listed on each securities exchange, if any, on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed, or (b) authorized to be quoted and/or listed (to the extent applicable) on the nasdaq national market if the registrable securities so qualify. (l) the company shall provide a cusip number for the registrable securities included in any registration statement not later than the effective date of such registration statement. (m) the company shall cooperate with each selling holder and each underwriter participating in the disposition of such registrable securities and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with the national association of securities dealers, inc. (n) the company shall during the period when the prospectus is required to be delivered under the securities act, promptly file all documents required to be filed with the commission pursuant to sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of page 7 the exchange act. (o) the company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of 12 months, beginning within three months after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and the rules and regulations of the commission thereunder. the company may require selling holders promptly to furnish in writing to the company such information regarding such selling holders, the plan of distribution of the registrable securities and other information as the company may from time to time reasonably request or as may be legally required in connection with such registration. section 3.02.registration expenses. in connection with any registration effected hereunder, the company shall pay the following expenses incurred in connection with such registration (the "registration expenses"): (i) registration and filing fees with the commission and the national association of securities dealers, inc., (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the registrable securities), (iii) printing expenses, (iv) fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing or quotation of the registrable securities, (v) fees and expenses of counsel to the company and the reasonable fees and expenses of independent certified public accountants for the company (including fees and expenses associated

roadshow costs and expenses not paid by the underwriters and (viii) the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for the selling holders. article iv indemnification and contribution section 4.01.indemnification by the company. the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each selling holder and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, partners, stockholders, members, employees, agents and representatives and each person (if any) which controls a selling holder within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by, arising out of, resulting from or related to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained or incorporated by reference in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities (as amended or supplemented if the company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by or based upon any information furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of such selling holder expressly for use therein or by the selling holder's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the company has furnished the selling holder with copies of the same; provided, however, that the company shall have no obligation to indemnify under this sentence to the extent any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities have been finally and non-appealably determined by a court to have resulted from such selling holder's willful misconduct or gross negligence. the company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the selling holders provided in this section 4.01, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by or based upon any information furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of such underwriter expressly for use therein or by the underwriter's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the company has furnished the underwriter with copies of the same; provided, however, that the company shall have no obligation to indemnify under this sentence to the extent any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities have been finally and non-appealably determined by a court to have resulted from any such underwriter's willful misconduct or gross negligence. section 4.02.indemnification by selling holders. each selling holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, which controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to each selling holder, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such selling holder expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. each selling holder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the company provided in this page 8 section 4.02, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such selling holder expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. each such selling holder's liability under this section 4.02 shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds (after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses) received by such selling holder from the sale of such registrable securities by such selling holder. the obligation of each selling holder shall be several and not joint. section 4.03.conduct of indemnification proceedings. in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.01 or section 4.02, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent such indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and, in the written opinion of counsel for the indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. in the case of any such separate firm for the indemnified parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. section 4.04.contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article iv is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities in respect of which indemnity is to be provided hereunder, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall to the fullest extent permitted by law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such party in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company, a selling holder and the underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and each selling holder agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.04 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this article iv, no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and each selling holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds of the offering (before deducting expenses) received by such selling holder exceeds the amount of any damages which such selling holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. page 9 article v miscellaneous section 5.01.participation in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any underwritten registered offering contemplated hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody arrangements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and this agreement and (c) furnishes in writing to the company such information regarding such person, the plan of distribution of the registrable securities and other information as the company may from time to time request or as may be legally required in connection with such registration; provided, however, that no such person shall be required to make any representations or warranties in connection with any such registration other than representations and warranties as to (i) such person's ownership of his or its registrable securities to be sold or transferred free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, (ii) such person's power and authority to effect such transfer and (iii) such matters pertaining to compliance with securities laws as may be reasonably requested; provided further, however, that the obligation of such person to indemnify pursuant to any such underwriting agreements shall be several, not joint and several, among such persons selling registrable securities, and the liability of each such person will be in proportion to, and provided further that such liability will be limited to, the net amount received by such person from the sale of such person's registrable securities pursuant to such registration. section 5.02.rule 144. the company covenants that it will file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and that it will take such further action as the holders may reasonably request to the extent required from time to time to enable the holders to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of any holder, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such reporting requirements. section 5.03. holdback agreements. each holder

(b) shares of series e preferred stock (if not earlier redeemed or converted) shall be mandatorily redeemed by the company on march 31, 2015 (the "mandatory redemption date"); provided, however, that if such date is not a business day, then the mandatory redemption date shall be the next business day), at a redemption price per share in cash equal to the then effective liquidation preference (after giving effect to the special dividend, if applicable), plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to the mandatory redemption date. (c) in the event of a redemption of fewer than all the shares of series e preferred stock, the shares of series e preferred stock will be chosen for redemption by the registrar from the outstanding shares of series e preferred stock not previously called for redemption, pro rata or by lot or by such other method as the registrar shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, that the company may redeem (an "odd-lot redemption") all shares held by holders of fewer than 100 shares of series e preferred stock (or by holders that would hold fewer than 100 shares of series e preferred stock following such redemption) prior to its redemption of other shares of series e preferred stock; provided, further, that the company may not redeem a portion of any share without redeeming the entire share. if fewer than all the shares of series e preferred stock represented by any share certificate are so to be redeemed, (i) the company shall issue a new certificate for the shares not redeemed and (ii) if any shares represented thereby are converted before termination of the conversion right with respect to such shares, such converted shares shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the shares represented by such share certificate that was selected for redemption. shares of series e preferred stock that have been converted during a selection of shares of series e preferred stock to be redeemed shall be treated by the registrar as outstanding for the purpose of such selection but not for the purpose of the payment of the redemption price. (d) in the event the company elects to effect an optional redemption, the company shall (i) make a public announcement of the redemption and (ii) give a redemption notice (the "redemption notice") to the holders not fewer than 30 days nor more than 60 days before the redemption date (the "redemption date"). whenever a redemption notice is required to be delivered to the holders, such notice shall provide the information set forth below and be given by first class mail, postage prepaid to each holder of shares of series e preferred stock to be redeemed, at such holder's address appearing in the series e preferred share register. all redemption notices shall identify the shares of series e preferred stock to be redeemed (including cusip number) and shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the applicable redemption price; (iii) if fewer than all the outstanding shares of series e preferred stock are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the certificate number, the total number of shares represented thereby and the number of such shares being redeemed on the redemption date) of the particular shares of series e preferred stock to be redeemed; (iv) that on the redemption date the redemption price, together with all accrued and unpaid dividends from the last dividend payment date to the redemption date, will become due and payable upon each such share of series e preferred stock to be redeemed and that dividends thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date; (v) the conversion price, the date on which the right to convert shares of series e preferred stock to be redeemed will terminate and the place or places where such shares of series e preferred stock may be surrendered for conversion; and (vi) the place or places where such shares of series e preferred stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price and the other amounts which are then payable. the redemption notice shall be given by the company or, at the company's request, by the registrar in the name and at the expense of the company; provided that if the company so requests, it shall provide the registrar adequate time, as reasonably determined by the registrar, to deliver such notices in a timely fashion. (e) prior to any redemption date, the company shall deposit with the registrar or with a paying agent (or, if the company is acting as its own paying agent, segregate and hold in trust) an amount of consideration sufficient to pay the redemption price of all the shares of series e preferred stock that are to page 6 be redeemed on that date plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to the redemption date. if any share of series e preferred stock called for redemption is converted, any consideration deposited with the registrar or with any paying agent or so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such share of series e preferred stock shall be paid or delivered to the company upon company order or, if then held by the company, shall be discharged from such trust. (f) notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the shares of series e preferred stock so to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein specified plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to the redemption date, and from and after such date (unless the company shall default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued but unpaid dividends) dividends on such shares of series e preferred stock shall cease to accrue and such shares shall cease to be convertible into shares of common stock. upon surrender of any such shares of series e preferred stock for redemption in accordance with said notice, such shares of series e preferred stock shall be redeemed by the company at the applicable redemption price, together with all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to the redemption date. if any share of series e preferred stock called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the redemption price thereof, and all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to the redemption date, shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption date at the dividend rate payable on the shares of series e preferred stock and such shares shall remain convertible. (g) any certificate that represents more than one share of series e preferred stock and is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at any office or agency of the company designated for that purpose (with, if the company or the registrar so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the company and the registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the company shall execute, and the registrar shall countersign and deliver to the holder of such share of series e preferred stock without service charge, a new series e preferred stock certificate or certificates, representing any number of shares of series e preferred stock as requested by such holder, in aggregate amount equal to and in exchange for the number of shares not redeemed and represented by the series e preferred stock certificate so surrendered. (h) if a share of series e preferred stock is redeemed subsequent to a dividend record date with respect to any dividend payment date and on or prior to such dividend payment date, then the accrued dividends payable on such dividend payment date will be paid to the person in whose name such share of series e preferred stock is registered at the close of business on such dividend record date. 11. method of payments the company may make any dividend payments in cash with respect to any dividend period beginning after march 31, 2005; provided that no payment shall be made in cash that would violate the provisions of the indenture dated as of may 5, 1998 between the company and state street bank and trust company of california, n.a. or the indenture dated april 23, 1999 between the same parties, if and to the extent those indentures are in effect. any dividends not paid in cash on a current basis on the applicable dividend payment date with respect to all periods after march 31, 2005, and all dividends with respect to periods prior to march 31, 2005, shall not be paid in cash but rather shall constitute accumulated dividends as dividends. no payment may be made in respect of accumulated dividends as dividends. rather, accumulated dividends shall be added to the liquidation preference. dividends may not be paid by delivery of shares of series e preferred stock. 12. conversion (a) subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this certificate of designation, at the option of the holder thereof, any share of series e preferred stock may be converted at any time into a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/100 of a share) equal to (i) the then effective liquidation preference thereof plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of conversion divided by (ii) the conversion price in effect at the time of conversion. such conversion right shall expire at the close of business on the business day next preceding the mandatory redemption date. in case a share of series e preferred stock is called for redemption, such conversion right in respect of the share so called shall expire at the close of business on the business day next preceding the redemption date, unless the company defaults in making the payment due upon redemption. the conversion price shall be initially $37.50 per share of common stock. the conversion price shall be adjusted in certain instances as provided in section 12(d) and section 12(e). (b) in order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holder of any page 7 share of series e preferred stock to be converted shall surrender the certificate for such share, duly endorsed or assigned to the company or in blank, at any office or agency of the company maintained for that purpose, accompanied by written notice to the company at such office or agency that the holder elects to convert such share or, if fewer than all the shares of series e preferred stock represented by a single share certificate are to be converted, the number of shares represented thereby to be converted. shares of series e preferred stock shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the day of surrender of such shares for conversion in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the holders of such shares as holders shall cease, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock at such time. as promptly as practicable on or after the conversion date, the company shall issue and shall deliver at such office or agency a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in section 12(c). in the case of any conversion of fewer than all the shares of series e preferred stock evidenced by a certificate, upon such conversion the company shall execute and the registrar shall countersign and deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the company, a new certificate or certificates representing the number of unconverted shares of series e preferred stock. (c) no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon the conversion of a share of series e preferred stock. if more than one share of series e preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of common stock which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of series e preferred stock so surrendered. instead of any fractional shares of common stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any share of series e preferred stock, the company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the closing price (as defined in section 12(d)(vi) per common share at the close of business on the business day prior to the day of conversion. (d) the conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time by the company as follows: (i) if the company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date (as defined in section 12(d)(vi)) fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date. if any dividend or distribution of the type described in this section 12(d)(i) is declared but not so paid or made, the conversion price shall again be adjusted to the conversion price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (ii) (a) in case the company shall issue or sell any common stock in a financing conducted as an underwritten public offering or a private placement (in each case for cash and other than transactions with strategic investors) for a consideration per share that is 90% or less than the current market price on the date of such issuance, or shall issue securities convertible into common stock having a conversion price per share that is 90% or less than the current market price at the date of issuance of such convertible security, the conversion price to be in effect after such issuance or sale shall be determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (y) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the company for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold (or issuable on conversion) would purchase at the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (2) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale and the number of additional shares of common stock to be issued or sold (or, in the case of convertible securities, issued on conversion). notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion price shall not be adjusted as a result of the circumstances described in this section 12(d)(ii)(a) if the hmtf holders shall be offered the opportunity to purchase their pro rata portion (based on the percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock represented by the series e preferred stock then held by the hmtf holders on an as-converted basis) of such offering. the preemptive right set forth in the preceding sentence shall be deemed waived as to an hmtf holder if such hmtf holder does not respond in a timely fashion to notice of the pricing of an offering to which the preemptive page 8 right would otherwise apply. (b) if the company shall offer or issue rights or warrants to all holders of its outstanding shares of common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price (as defined in section 12(d)(vi)) on the common stock record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the conversion price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the date after such common stock record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of common stock subject to such rights or warrants would purchase at such current market price and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date plus the total number of additional shares of common stock subject to such rights or warrants for subscription or purchase. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to purchase or receive such rights or warrants. to the extent that shares of common stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants the conversion price shall again be adjusted to be the conversion price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of common stock actually delivered. if such rights or warrants are not so issued, the conversion price shall again be adjusted to be the conversion price which would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at less than such current market price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of common stock, there shall be taken into account (x) any consideration received for such rights or warrants, with the value of such consideration and the amount of such exercise or subscription price, if other than cash, to be determined by the board of directors and (y) the amount of any exercise price or subscription price required to be paid upon exercise of such warrants or rights. (iii) if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (iv) if the company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its shares of common stock any class of capital stock of the company (other than any dividends or distributions to which section 12(d)(i) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness, cash or other assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants of a type referred to in section 12(d)(ii)(b) and dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash and excluding any capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, cash or assets distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which section 12(e) applies) (the foregoing hereinafter in this section 12(d)(iv) called the "distributed securities"), then, in each such case, the conversion price shall be reduced so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the common stock record date (as defined in section 12(d)(vi) with respect to such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price (determined as provided in section 12(d)(vi) on such date less the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) on such date of the portion of the distributed securities so distributed applicable to one share of common stock and the denominator shall be such current market price, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date; provided, however, that, in the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the distributed securities so distributed applicable to one share of common stock is equal to or greater than the current market price on the common stock record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of shares of series e preferred stock shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a share of series e preferred stock (or any portion thereof) the amount of distributed securities such holder would have received had such holder converted such share of series e preferred stock (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such common stock record date. if such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the conversion price shall again be adjusted to be the conversion price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. if the board of directors page 9 determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this section 12(d)(iv) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities constituting all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the current market price pursuant to section 12(d)(vi) to the extent possible. rights or warrants distributed by the company to all holders of shares of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("dilution trigger event"): (a) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock; (b) are not exercisable; and (c) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares of common stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 12(d)(iv) (and no adjustment to the conversion price under this section 12(d)(iv) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest dilution trigger event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment to the conversion price under this section 12(d)(iv) shall be made. if any such rights or warrants, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the first issuance of shares of series e preferred stock, are subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of each of which such rights or warrants shall become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be such date of issuance and record date with respect to new rights or warrants (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants, without exercise by the holder thereof). in addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any dilution trigger event with respect thereto, that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the conversion price under this section 12(d) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the conversion price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or dilution trigger event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of shares of common stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of shares of common stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the conversion price shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 12(d)(iv) to the contrary, rights, warrants, evidences of indebtedness, other securities, cash or other assets (including, without limitation, any rights distributed pursuant to any shareholder rights plan) shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 12(d)(iv) if the company makes proper provision so that each holder of shares of series e preferred stock who converts a share of series e preferred stock (or any portion thereof) after the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be entitled to receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion, the amount and kind of such distributions that such holder would have been entitled to receive if such holder had, immediately prior to such determination date, converted such share of series e preferred stock into a share of common stock. for purposes of this section 12(d)(iv) and sections 12(d)(i) and (ii), any dividend or distribution to which this section 12(d)(iv) is applicable that also includes shares of common stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock to which section 12(d)(ii) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (a) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants other than such shares of common stock or rights or warrants to which section 12(d)(ii) applies (and any conversion price reduction required by this section 12(d)(iv) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (b) a dividend or distribution of such shares of common stock or such rights or warrants (and any further conversion price reduction required by sections 12(d)(i) or 12(d)(ii) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except that (1) the common stock record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the common stock record date fixed for such determination" and "the common stock record date" within the meaning of section 12(d)(i) and as "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants", "the common stock record date fixed for the determination of the share holders entitled to receive such rights or warrants" and "such common stock record date" for purposes of section 12(d)(ii), and (2) any shares of common stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" for the purposes of section 12(d)(i). (v) if a tender offer made by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the common stock expires and such tender offer (as page 10 amended upon the expiration thereof) requires the payment to shareholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of purchased shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) that, combined together with the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) as of the expiration of such tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the shares of common stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this section 12(d)(v) has been made, exceeds 5% of the net income of the company reported for the 12 month period ending with the fiscal quarter next preceding such payment (the "12 month net income") (determined as of the last time (the "expiration time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended) then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the expiration time, the conversion price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the expiration time by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the expiration time multiplied by the current market price of a share of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the expiration time and the denominator shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "purchased shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of common stock outstanding (less any purchased shares) at the expiration time and the current market price of the shares of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the expiration time, such reduction (if any) to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the expiration time. if the company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the conversion price shall again be adjusted to be the conversion price which would then be in effect if such tender offer had not been made. if the application of this section 12(d)(v) to any tender offer would result in an increase in the conversion price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this section 12(d)(v). (vi) for purposes of this section 12(d), the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: "closing price" with respect to any securities on any day means the closing sale price as of 4:00 p.m. eastern time on such day or any earlier final closing on such day or, if no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported high and low bid prices on such day, in each case on the nasdaq national market, or the new york stock exchange, as applicable, or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on such national market or exchange, on the national stock exchange or commission recognized trading market in the united states on which such security is quoted or listed or admitted to trading, or, if not quoted or listed or admitted to trading on any national stock exchange or commission recognized trading market in the united states, the average of the high and low bid prices of such security on the over-the-counter market on the day in question as reported by the national quotation bureau incorporated or a similar generally accepted reporting service in the united states, or, if not so available, in such manner as furnished by any new york stock exchange member firm selected from time to time by the board of directors for that purpose, or a price determined in good faith by the board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors. "common stock record date" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of common stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the common stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the board of directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). "current market price" means the average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock for the 10 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date in question; provided, however, that (a) if the "ex" date (as hereinafter defined) for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to section 12(d)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) occurs during such 10 consecutive trading days, the closing price for each trading day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the same fraction by which the conversion price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, (b) if the "ex" date for any event page 11 (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to section 12(d)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) occurs on or after the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the conversion price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event and (c) if the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this proviso, the closing price for each trading day on or after such "ex" date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the amount of any cash and the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors in a manner consistent with any good faith determination of such value for purposes of section 12(d)(iv), whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock or assets being distributed applicable to one share of common stock as of the close of business on the day before such "ex" date. for purposes of any computation under section 12(d)(v), the current market price on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock for such day and the next two succeeding trading days; provided, however, that, if the "ex" date for any event (other than the tender offer requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to section 12(d)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) occurs on or after the expiration time for the tender or exchange offer requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the conversion price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event. for purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex" date (1) when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the closing price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, (2) when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of common stock, means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective and (3) when used with respect to any tender or exchange offer means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the expiration time of such offer. notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever successive adjustments to the conversion price are called for pursuant to this section 12(d), such adjustments shall be made to the current market price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this section 12(d) and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the board of directors. "fair market value" means the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction. (vii) no adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this section 12(d)(vii) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this section 12 shall be made by the company and shall be made to the nearest cent. no adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the common stock. (viii) whenever the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided, the company shall promptly file with the registrar an officers' certificate setting forth the conversion price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. promptly after delivery of such certificate, the company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the conversion price setting forth the adjusted conversion price and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the conversion price to each holder of shares of series e preferred stock at such holder's last address appearing on the register of holders maintained for that purpose within 20 days of the effective date of such adjustment. failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment. (ix) in any case in which this section 12(d) provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a common stock record date for an event, the company may defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to the holder of any share of series e preferred stock converted after such common stock record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment. (x) for purposes of this section 12(d), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company. the company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in the treasury of the company. page 12 (e) subject to section 13, in case of any consolidation of the company with, or merger of the company into, any other corporation, or in case of any merger of another corporation into the company (other than a merger that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of common stock of the company), or in case of any sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the company, the holder of each share of series e preferred stock shall have the right thereafter, during the period such share of series e preferred stock shall be convertible as specified in section 12(a), to convert such share of series e preferred stock into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the company into which such share of series e preferred stock might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, assuming such holder of shares of common stock of the company failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer (provided that, if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer is not the same for each share of common stock of the company in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("nonelecting share"), then for the purpose of this section 12 the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer by each nonelecting share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the nonelecting shares). such securities shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of the triggering event, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 12. the above provisions of this section 12 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, conveyances or transfers.

(a) exercisability. the holder of this warrant may exercise it in whole or in part to the extent then exercisable by surrender of this warrant, with the form of subscription at the end of this warrant duly executed by the holder, to the company at its principal office (or to the office of the warrant agent as contemplated in section 6(b), if applicable), accompanied by payment, in lawful money of the united states, of the amount obtained by multiplying the exercise price (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to the terms of this warrant) by the number of shares of common stock designated in such completed subscription form. this warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the day of surrender of such warrant, and the person or persons entitled to receive shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock at such time. (b) payment of exercise price payment shall be made by check payable to the company. (c) restrictions on exercise. this warrant is exercisable at any time and from time to time from the date hereof, provided this warrant has not terminated pursuant to section 10. 3. delivery of stock certificates. as soon as possible after full or partial exercise of this warrant in accordance with the terms hereof and in any event within ten (10) days after such exercise, the company, at its expense, will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the holder of this warrant, a certificate or certificates for the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock to which that holder shall be entitled upon such exercise. in the event that this warrant is exercised in part, the company at its expense will also execute and deliver a new warrant of like tenor exercisable for the number of shares for which this warrant may then be exercised. no fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of this warrant. if upon any exercise of this warrant a fraction of a share would otherwise be issuable, the company will pay the cash value of that fractional share, calculated on the basis of the fair market value as of the date of exercise. 4. adjustment provisions the exercise price shall be adjusted from time to time by the company as follows: (a) if the company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date (as defined in section 4(f)(ii)) fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date. if any dividend or distribution of the type described in this section 4(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to the exercise price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (b) (i) in case the company shall issue or sell any common stock in a financing conducted as an underwritten public offering or a private placement (in each case for cash and other than transactions with strategic investors) for a consideration per share that is 90% or less than the current market price on the date of such issuance, or shall issue securities convertible into common stock having an exercise price per share that is 90% or less than the current market price at the date of issuance of such convertible security, the exercise price to be in effect after such issuance or sale shall be determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (y) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the company for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold (or issuable on conversion) would purchase at the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (2) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale and the number of additional shares of common stock to be issued or sold (or, in the case of convertible securities, issued on conversion). notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise price shall not be adjusted as a result of the circumstances described in this section 4(b)(i) if the hmtf holders shall be offered the opportunity to purchase their pro rata portion (based on the page 2 percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock represented by the warrants then held by such hmtf holders on an as-exercised basis) of such offering. the preemptive right set forth in the preceding sentence shall be deemed waived as to an hmtf holder if such hmtf holder does not respond in a timely fashion to notice of the pricing of the offering to which the preemptive right would otherwise apply. (ii) if the company shall offer or issue rights or warrants to all holders of its outstanding shares of common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price (as defined in section 4(f) (iii)) on the common stock record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the exercise price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the date after such common stock record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of common stock subject to such rights or warrants would purchase at such current market price and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date plus the total number of additional shares of common stock subject to such rights or warrants for subscription or purchase. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to purchase or receive such rights or warrants. to the extent that shares of common stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of common stock actually delivered. if such rights or warrants are not so issued, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at less than such current market price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of common stock, there shall be taken into account (x) any consideration received for such rights or warrants, with the value of such consideration and the amount of such exercise or subscription price, if other than cash, to be determined by the board of directors and (y) the amount of any exercise price or subscription price required to be paid upon exercise of such warrants or rights. (c) if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (d) (i) if the company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its shares of common stock any class of capital stock of the company (other than any dividends or distributions to which section 4(a) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness, cash or other assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants of a type referred to in section 4(b)(ii) and dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash and excluding any capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, cash or assets distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which section 4(k) applies) (the foregoing hereinafter in this section 4(d) called the "distributed securities"), then, in each such case, the exercise price shall be reduced so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the common stock record date with respect to such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price (determined as provided in section 4(f)(iii)) on such date less the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) on such date of the portion of the distributed securities so distributed applicable to one share of common stock and the denominator shall be such current market price, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date; provided, however, that, in the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the distributed securities so distributed applicable to one share of common stock is equal to or greater than the current market price on the common stock record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each warrantholder shall have the right to receive upon exercise of such warrant (or any portion thereof) the amount of distributed securities such holder would have received had such holder exercised such warrant (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such common stock record date. if such dividend or distribution is not page 3 so paid or made, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. if the board of directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this section 4(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities constituting all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the current market price pursuant to section 4(f)(iii) to the extent possible. (ii) options, rights or warrants distributed by the company to all holders of shares of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which options, rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("dilution trigger event"): (a) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock; (b) are not exercisable; and (c) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares of common stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 4(d)(ii) (and no adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4(d)(ii) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest dilution trigger event, whereupon such options, rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4(d)(ii) shall be made. if any such options, rights or warrants, including any such existing options, rights or warrants distributed prior to the first issuance of the warrants, are subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of each of which such options, rights or warrants shall become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be such date of issuance and record date with respect to new options, rights or warrants (and a termination or expiration of the existing options, rights or warrants, without exercise by the holder thereof). in addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of options, rights or warrants, or any dilution trigger event with respect thereto, that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4 was made, (1) in the case of any such options, rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the exercise price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or dilution trigger event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of shares of common stock with respect to such options, rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such options, rights or warrants), made to all holders of shares of common stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such options, rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the exercise price shall be readjusted as if such options, rights and warrants had not been issued. (iii) notwithstanding any other provision of this section 4(d) to the contrary, options, rights, warrants, evidences of indebtedness, other securities, cash or other assets (including, without limitation, any rights distributed pursuant to any shareholder rights plan) shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 4(d) if the company makes proper provision so that each warrantholder who exercises such warrants (or any portion thereof) after the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be entitled to receive upon such exercise, in addition to the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise, the amount and kind of such distributions that such holder would have been entitled to receive if such holder had, immediately prior to such determination date, exercised such warrants. (iv) for purposes of this section 4(d) and sections 4(a) and 4(b), any dividend or distribution to which this section 4(d) is applicable that also includes shares of common stock, or options, rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock to which 4(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (a) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants other than such shares of common stock or options, rights or warrants to which section 4(b) applies (and any exercise price reduction required by this section 4(d)(iv) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (b) a dividend or distribution of such shares of common stock or such options, rights or warrants (and any further exercise price reduction required by sections 4(a) or 4(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except that (1) the common stock record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the common stock record date fixed for such determination" and "the common stock record date" within the meaning of section 4(a) and as "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants", "the common stock record date fixed for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants" and "such common stock record date" for purposes of section 4(b), and (2) any shares of common stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" for the purposes of section 4(a). page 4 (e) if a tender offer made by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the common stock expires and such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) requires the payment to shareholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of purchased shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) that, combined together with the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) as of the expiration of such tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the shares of common stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this section 4(e) has been made, exceeds 5% of the income of the company reported for the 12 month period ending with the fiscal quarter next preceding such payment (the "12 month net income") (determined as of the last time (the "expiration time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended)), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the expiration time, the exercise price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the expiration time by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the expiration time multiplied by the current market price of a share of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the expiration time and the denominator shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "purchased shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of common stock outstanding (less any purchased shares) at the expiration time and the current market price of the shares of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the expiration time, such reduction (if any) to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the expiration time. if the company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such tender offer had not been made. if the application of this section 4(e) to any tender offer would result in an increase in the exercise price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this section 4(e). (f) for purposes of this section 4, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: (i) "closing price" with respect to any securities on any day means the closing sale price as of 4:00 p.m. eastern time on such day or any earlier final closing on such day or, if no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported high and low bid prices on such day, in each case on the nasdaq national market, or the new york stock exchange, as applicable, or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on such national market or exchange, on the national stock exchange or commission recognized trading market in the united states on which such security is quoted or listed or admitted to trading, or, if not quoted or listed or admitted to trading on any national stock exchange or commission recognized trading market in the united states, the average of the high and low bid prices of such security on the over-the-counter market on the day in question as reported by the national quotation bureau incorporated or a similar generally accepted reporting service in the united states, or, if not so available, in such manner as furnished by any new york stock exchange member firm selected from time to time by the board of directors for that purpose, or a price determined in good faith by the board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors. (ii) "common stock record date" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of common stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the common stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the board of directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). (iii) "current market price" means the average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock for the 10 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date in question; provided, however, that (a) if the "ex" date (as hereinafter defined) for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e) occurs during such 10 consecutive trading days, the closing price for each trading day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the same fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, (b) if the "ex" date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), page 5 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e) occurs on or after the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event and (c) if the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this proviso, the closing price for each trading day on or after such "ex" date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the amount of any cash and the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors in a manner consistent with any good faith determination of such value for purposes of section 4(d), whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock or assets being distributed applicable to one share of common stock as of the close of business on the day before such "ex" date. for purposes of any computation under section 4(e), the current market price on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock for such day and the next two succeeding trading days; provided, however, that, if the "ex" date for any event (other than the tender offer requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e), occurs on or after the expiration time for the tender or exchange offer requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event. for purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex" date (1) when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the closing price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, (2) when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of common stock, means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective and (3) when used with respect to any tender or exchange offer means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the expiration time of such offer. notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever successive adjustments to the exercise price are called for pursuant to this section 4, such adjustments shall be made to the current market price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this section 4 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the board of directors. (iv) "fair market value" means the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction. (g) no adjustment in the exercise price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this section 4(g) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this section 4 shall be made by the company and shall be made to the nearest cent. no adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the common stock. (h) whenever the exercise price is adjusted as herein provided, the company shall promptly file with the registrar an officers' certificate setting forth the exercise price after such adjustment and the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant will be exercisable after such adjustment pursuant to section 4(e) and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. promptly after delivery of such certificate, the company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the exercise price setting forth the adjusted exercise price and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the exercise price to each warrantholder at such holder's last address appearing on the register of holders maintained for that purpose within 20 days of the effective date of such adjustment. failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment. (i) in any case in which this section 4 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a common stock record date for an event, the company may defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to the holder of any warrant exercised after such common stock record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment. (j) for purposes of this section 4, the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company. the company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in the treasury of the company. (k) in case of any consolidation of the company with, or merger of the company into, any other person, or in case of any merger of another person into the company (other than a merger that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancelation of outstanding shares of page 6 common stock of the company), or in case of any sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the company, the warrantholders shall have the right thereafter, during the period such warrant shall be exercisable as specified in section 2(a), to convert such warrants into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the company for which the warrants might have been exercised immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, assuming such holder of shares of common stock of the company failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer (provided that, if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer is not the same for each share of common stock of the company in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("nonelecting share"), then for the purpose of this section 4(k) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer by each nonelecting share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the nonelecting shares). such securities shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of the triggering event, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4(k). the above provisions of this section 4(k) shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, conveyances or transfers. (l) upon each adjustment of the exercise price as a result of the operation of this section 4, this warrant shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted exercise price, that number of shares of common stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares covered by this warrant immediately prior to this adjustment by the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product so obtained by the exercise price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the exercise price. 5. notice of certain events. if at any time prior to the termination or full exercise of this warrant: (a) the company shall declare any dividend payable in stock upon its common stock, make any distribution to the holders of its common stock or offer for subscription pro rata to holders of common stock any additional shares of stock of any class or other rights; (b) there shall be any reclassification of the common stock of the company; (c) there shall be any consolidation or merger of the company with or into, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation; (d) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company; or (e) there shall be a public offering; then, in any one or more of such cases, the company shall give the holder at least 10 days' prior written notice of the date on which the books of the company shall close or a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights or for determining rights to vote in respect to any such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up or of the date of a filing of a registration statement under the securities act for a public offering. such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause shall also specify, in the case of any such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, the date on which the holders shall be entitled thereto, and such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause shall also specify the date on which the holders shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, as the case may be. each such written notice shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepared, addressed to the holder at the address of the holder as shown on the books of the company. 6. transfer of warrants. (a) warrant register. the company shall maintain a register (the "warrant register") containing the names, addresses and facsimile numbers of the holder(s). any holder of this warrant or any portion thereof may change its address as shown on the warrant register by written notice to the company requesting such a change. until this warrant is transferred on the warrant register, the company may treat the holder as shown on the warrant register as the absolute owner of this warrant for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. (b) warrant agent. the company may, by written notice to the holder, appoint an agent for the purpose of maintaining the warrant register referred to in section 6(a) above, issuing any other securities then issuable upon the exercise of this warrant, exchanging this warrant, replacing this warrant or any or all of the foregoing. thereafter, any such registration, issuance or page 7 replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at the office of such agent. (c) transferability and negotiability of warrant. title to this warrant may be transferred by endorsement (by the holder executing the assignment form attached hereto) and delivery in the same manner as negotiable instruments transferable by endorsement and delivery. (d) exchange of warrant upon a transfer. on surrender of this warrant for exchange, properly endorsed on the assignment form and subject to the provisions of this warrant with respect to compliance with the securities act, the company at its expense shall issue to or on the order of the holder a new warrant or warrants of like tenor, in the name of the holder or as the holders (on payment by the holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may direct, exercisable for the number of shares issuable upon the exercise hereof. 7. registration rights. if the holder of this warrant is a party to, or an assignee of rights under, that certain registration rights agreement, dated march 16, 2000 (the "registration rights agreement"), such holder shall be entitled to include any shares of common stock or other securities received upon exercise of the warrant with such holder's registrable securities (as such term is defined in the registration rights agreement), on the terms and conditions as set forth in the registration rights agreement. 8. amendment and waivers. no amendment, modification or termination of this warrant shall be binding unless executed in writing by the company and the warrantholder intending to be bound thereby. 9. waivers and extensions. any provision of this warrant may be amended, waived or modified only if such amendment, waiver or modification is in writing, is signed by the party intending to be bound, and specifically refers to this warrant. waivers may be made in advance or after the right waived has arisen or the breach or default waived has occurred. any waiver may be conditional. no waiver of any breach of any agreement or provision herein contained shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach thereof nor of any other agreement or provision herein contained. no waiver or extension of time for performance of any obligations or acts shall be deemed a waiver or extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or acts. 10. termination. the right to exercise this warrant shall expire and shall be void at 5:00 p.m. new york city time on march 16, 2003. 11. reservation of stock. the company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance upon exercise of this warrant, all shares of common stock or other securities from time to time issuable upon exercise of this warrant and, subject to any existing contractual limitations, from time to time, will take all steps necessary to amend its certificate of incorporation to provide sufficient reserves of shares of common stock or other securities issuable upon exercise of this warrant. the company further covenants that all shares that may be issued upon the exercise of rights represented by this warrant and payment of the exercise price, as set forth herein, will be fully paid and non-assessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges in respect of the issue thereof. the company also agrees that its issuance of this warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of common stock upon exercise of this warrant. 12. replacement. on receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of this warrant and, in the case of loss, theft, or destruction, on delivery of any indemnity agreement or bond reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the company or, in the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this warrant, the company at its expense will execute and deliver, in lieu of this warrant, a new warrant of like tenor. 13. no rights as stockholder. except as provided in section 2 or 4, no holder of this warrant, as such, shall be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be considered a stockholder of the company for any purpose, nor shall anything in this warrant be construed to confer on any holder of this warrant as such, any rights of a stockholder of the company or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action, to receive notice of meeting of stockholders, to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise. 14. miscellaneous provisions.

(a) exercisability. the holder of this warrant may exercise it in whole or in part to the extent then exercisable by surrender of this warrant, with the form of subscription at the end of this warrant duly executed by the holder, to the company at its principal office (or to the office of the warrant agent as contemplated in section 6(b), if applicable), accompanied by payment, in lawful money of the united states, of the amount obtained by multiplying the exercise price (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to the terms of this warrant) by the number of shares of common stock designated in such completed subscription form. this warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the day of surrender of such warrant, and the person or persons entitled to receive shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock at such time. (b) payment of exercise price. payment shall be made by check payable to the company. (c) net issue exercise. notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if the fair market value (as defined below) of one share of common stock is greater than the exercise price (on the date of exercise of this warrant), in lieu of exercising this warrant in exchange for cash, the holder may elect to exercise all or a portion of this warrant by canceling all or a portion of this warrant and receiving in exchange therefor shares of common stock (as determined below) equal to the value of this warrant, or the portion thereof being canceled, by surrender of this warrant at the principal office of the company (or the office of the warrant agent contemplated by section 6(b), if applicable) together with a duly executed form of subscription, in which event the company shall issue to the holder a number of shares of common stock computed using the following formula: x=y(a-b) --------- a where x = the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the holder y = the number of shares of common stock purchasable under the warrant or, if only a portion of the warrant is being exercised, under the portion of the warrant being exercised (on the date of exercise) a = the fair market value of one share of the common stock (on the date of exercise) b = the exercise price (as adjusted on the date of exercise) for purposes of the above calculation, "fair market value" of one share of common stock shall be determined by the company's board of directors in good faith; provided, however, where a public market exists for the common stock at the time of such exercise, the "fair market value", per share shall be equal to the average for the five trading days prior to the date of such exercise of the average of the closing bid and asked prices of the common stock quoted in the over-the-counter market summary or the last reported sale price of the common stock quoted on the nasdaq national market system or the principal exchange on which the common stock is then listed, whichever is applicable, as published in the wall street journal. (d) restrictions on exercise. this warrant is exercisable at any time and from time to time from the date hereof, provided this warrant has not terminated pursuant to section 10. 3. delivery of stock certificates. as soon as possible after full or partial exercise of this warrant in accordance with the terms hereof and in any event within ten (10) days after such exercise, the company, at its expense, will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the holder of this warrant, a certificate or certificates for the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock to which that holder shall be entitled upon such exercise. in the event that this warrant is exercised in part, the company at its expense will also execute and deliver a new warrant of like tenor exercisable for the number of shares for which this warrant may then be exercised. no fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of this warrant. if upon any exercise of this warrant a fraction of a share would otherwise be issuable, the company will pay the cash page 2 value of that fractional share, calculated on the basis of the fair market value as of the date of exercise. 4. adjustment provisions the exercise price shall be adjusted from time to time by the company as follows: (a) if the company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date (as defined in section 4(f)(ii)) fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date. if any dividend or distribution of the type described in this section 4(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to the exercise price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (b) (i) in case the company shall issue or sell any common stock in a financing conducted as an underwritten public offering or a private placement (in each case for cash and other than transactions with strategic investors) for a consideration per share that is 90% or less than the current market price on the date of such issuance, or shall issue securities convertible into common stock having an exercise price per share that is 90% or less than the current market price at the date of issuance of such convertible security, the exercise price to be in effect after such issuance or sale shall be determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (y) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the company for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold (or issuable on conversion) would purchase at the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (2) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale and the number of additional shares of common stock to be issued or sold (or, in the case of convertible securities, issued on conversion). notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise price shall not be adjusted as a result of the circumstances described in this section 4(b)(i) if the hmtf holders shall be offered the opportunity to purchase their pro rata portion (based on the percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock represented by the warrants then held by such hmtf holders on an as-exercised basis) of such offering. the preemptive right set forth in the preceding sentence shall be deemed waived as to an hmtf holder if such hmtf holder does not respond in a timely fashion to notice of the pricing of the offering to which the preemptive right would otherwise apply. (ii) if the company shall offer or issue rights or warrants to all holders of its outstanding shares of common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price (as defined in section 4(f) (iii)) on the common stock record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the exercise price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the date after such common stock record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of common stock subject to such rights or warrants would purchase at such current market price and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date plus the total number of additional shares of common stock subject to such rights or warrants for subscription or purchase. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to purchase or receive such rights or warrants. to the extent that shares of common stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of common stock actually delivered. if such rights or warrants are not so issued, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at less than such current market price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of common stock, there page 3 shall be taken into account (x) any consideration received for such rights or warrants, with the value of such consideration and the amount of such exercise or subscription price, if other than cash, to be determined by the board of directors and (y) the amount of any exercise price or subscription price required to be paid upon exercise of such warrants or rights. (c) if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (d) (i) if the company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its shares of common stock any class of capital stock of the company (other than any dividends or distributions to which section 4(a) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness, cash or other assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants of a type referred to in section 4(b)(ii) and dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash and excluding any capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, cash or assets distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which section 4(k) applies) (the foregoing hereinafter in this section 4(d) called the "distributed securities"), then, in each such case, the exercise price shall be reduced so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the common stock record date with respect to such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price (determined as provided in section 4(f)(iii)) on such date less the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) on such date of the portion of the distributed securities so distributed applicable to one share of common stock and the denominator shall be such current market price, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date; provided, however, that, in the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the distributed securities so distributed applicable to one share of common stock is equal to or greater than the current market price on the common stock record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each warrantholder shall have the right to receive upon exercise of such warrant (or any portion thereof) the amount of distributed securities such holder would have received had such holder exercised such warrant (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such common stock record date. if such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. if the board of directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this section 4(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities constituting all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the current market price pursuant to section 4(f)(iii) to the extent possible. (ii) options, rights or warrants distributed by the company to all holders of shares of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which options, rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("dilution trigger event"): (a) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock; (b) are not exercisable; and (c) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares of common stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 4(d)(ii) (and no adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4(d)(ii) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest dilution trigger event, whereupon such options, rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4(d)(ii) shall be made. if any such options, rights or warrants, including any such existing options, rights or warrants distributed prior to the first issuance of the warrants, are subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of each of which such options, rights or warrants shall become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be such date of issuance and record date with respect to new options, rights or warrants (and a termination or expiration of the existing options, rights or warrants, without exercise by the holder thereof). in addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of options, rights or warrants, or any dilution trigger event with respect thereto, that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4 was made, (1) in the case of any such options, rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the exercise price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or dilution trigger event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the page 4 per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of shares of common stock with respect to such options, rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such options, rights or warrants), made to all holders of shares of common stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such options, rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the exercise price shall be readjusted as if such options, rights and warrants had not been issued. (iii) notwithstanding any other provision of this section 4(d) to the contrary, options, rights, warrants, evidences of indebtedness, other securities, cash or other assets (including, without limitation, any rights distributed pursuant to any shareholder rights plan) shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 4(d) if the company makes proper provision so that each warrantholder who exercises such warrants (or any portion thereof) after the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be entitled to receive upon such exercise, in addition to the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise, the amount and kind of such distributions that such holder would have been entitled to receive if such holder had, immediately prior to such determination date, exercised such warrants. (iv) for purposes of this section 4(d) and sections 4(a) and 4(b), any dividend or distribution to which this section 4(d) is applicable that also includes shares of common stock, or options, rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock to which 4(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (a) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants other than such shares of common stock or options, rights or warrants to which section 4(b) applies (and any exercise price reduction required by this section 4(d)(iv) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (b) a dividend or distribution of such shares of common stock or such options, rights or warrants (and any further exercise price reduction required by sections 4(a) or 4(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except that (1) the common stock record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the common stock record date fixed for such determination" and "the common stock record date" within the meaning of section 4(a) and as "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants", "the common stock record date fixed for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants" and "such common stock record date" for purposes of section 4(b), and (2) any shares of common stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" for the purposes of section 4(a). (e) if a tender offer made by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the common stock expires and such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) requires the payment to shareholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of purchased shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) that, combined together with the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) as of the expiration of such tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the shares of common stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this section 4(e) has been made, exceeds 5% of the income of the company reported for the 12 month period ending with the fiscal quarter next preceding such payment (the "12 month net income") (determined as of the last time (the "expiration time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended)), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the expiration time, the exercise price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the expiration time by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the expiration time multiplied by the current market price of a share of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the expiration time and the denominator shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "purchased shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of common stock outstanding (less any purchased shares) at the expiration time and the current market price of a share of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the expiration time, such reduction (if any) to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the expiration time. if the company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender page 5 offer, but the company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such tender offer had not been made. if the application of this section 4(e) to any tender offer would result in an increase in the exercise price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this section 4(e). (f) for purposes of this section 4, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: (i) "closing price" with respect to any securities on any day means the closing sale price as of 4:00 p.m. eastern time on such day or any earlier final closing on such day or, if no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported high and low bid prices on such day, in each case on the nasdaq national market, or the new york stock exchange, as applicable, or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on such national market or exchange, on the national stock exchange or commission recognized trading market in the united states on which such security is quoted or listed or admitted to trading, or, if not quoted or listed or admitted to trading on any national stock exchange or commission recognized trading market in the united states, the average of the high and low bid prices of such security on the over-the-counter market on the day in question as reported by the national quotation bureau incorporated or a similar generally accepted reporting service in the united states, or, if not so available, in such manner as furnished by any new york stock exchange member firm selected from time to time by the board of directors for that purpose, or a price determined in good faith by the board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors. (ii) "common stock record date" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of common stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the common stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the board of directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). (iii) "current market price" means the average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock for the 10 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date in question; provided, however, that (a) if the "ex" date (as hereinafter defined) for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e) occurs during such 10 consecutive trading days, the closing price for each trading day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the same fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, (b) if the "ex" date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e) occurs on or after the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event and (c) if the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this proviso, the closing price for each trading day on or after such "ex" date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the amount of any cash and the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors in a manner consistent with any good faith determination of such value for purposes of section 4(d), whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock or assets being distributed applicable to one share of common stock as of the close of business on the day before such "ex" date. for purposes of any computation under section 4(e), the current market price on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock for such day and the next two succeeding trading days; provided, however, that, if the "ex" date for any event (other than the tender offer requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e), occurs on or after the expiration time for the tender or exchange offer requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event. for purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex" date (1) when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the closing price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, (2) when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of common stock, means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective and (3) when used with respect to any tender or exchange offer means page 6 the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the expiration time of such offer. notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever successive adjustments to the exercise price are called for pursuant to this section 4, such adjustments shall be made to the current market price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this section 4 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the board of directors. (iv) "fair market value" means the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction. (g) no adjustment in the exercise price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this section 4(g) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this section 4 shall be made by the company and shall be made to the nearest cent. no adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the common stock. (h) whenever the exercise price is adjusted as herein provided, the company shall promptly file with the registrar an officers' certificate setting forth the exercise price after such adjustment and the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant will be exercisable after such adjustment pursuant to section 4(e) and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. promptly after delivery of such certificate, the company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the exercise price setting forth the adjusted exercise price and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the exercise price to each warrantholder at such holder's last address appearing on the register of holders maintained for that purpose within 20 days of the effective date of such adjustment. failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.

(b) payment of exercise price. payment shall be made by check payable to the company. (c) net issue exercise. notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if the fair market value (as defined below) of one share of common stock is greater than the exercise price (on the date of exercise of this warrant), in lieu of exercising this warrant in exchange for cash, the holder may elect to exercise all or a portion of this warrant by canceling all or a portion of this warrant and receiving in exchange therefor shares of common stock (as determined below) equal to the value of this warrant, or the portion thereof being canceled, by surrender of this warrant at the principal office of the company (or the office of the warrant agent contemplated by section 6(b), if applicable) together with a duly executed form of subscription, in which event the company shall issue to the holder a number of shares of common stock computed using the following formula: x=y(a-b) a where x = the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the holder y = the number of shares of common stock purchasable under the warrant or, if only a portion of the warrant is being exercised, under the portion of the warrant being exercised (on the date of exercise) a = the fair market value of one share of the common stock (on the date of exercise) b = the exercise price (as adjusted on the date of exercise) for purposes of the above calculation, "fair market value" of one share of common stock shall be determined by the company's board of directors in good faith; provided, however, where a public market exists for the common stock at the time of such exercise, the "fair market value", per share shall be equal to the average for the five trading days prior to the date of such exercise of the average of the closing bid and asked prices of the common stock quoted in the over-the-counter market summary or the last reported sale price of the common stock quoted on the nasdaq national market system or the principal exchange on which the common stock is then listed, whichever is applicable, as published in the wall street journal. (d) restrictions on exercise. this warrant is exercisable at any time and from time to time from the date hereof, provided this warrant has not terminated pursuant to section 10. 3. delivery of stock certificates. as soon as possible after full or partial exercise of this warrant in accordance with the terms hereof and in any event within ten (10) days after such exercise, the company, at its expense, will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the holder of this warrant, a certificate or certificates for the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock to which that holder shall be entitled upon such exercise. in the event that this warrant is exercised in part, the company at its expense will also execute and deliver a new warrant of like tenor exercisable for the number of shares for which this warrant may then be exercised. no fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of this warrant. if upon any exercise of this warrant a fraction of a share would otherwise be issuable, the company will pay the cash value of that fractional share, calculated on the basis of the fair market value as of the date of exercise. page 2 4. adjustment provisions the exercise price shall be adjusted from time to time by the company as follows: (a) if the company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date (as defined in section 4(f)(ii)) fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date. if any dividend or distribution of the type described in this section 4(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to the exercise price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (b) (i) in case the company shall issue or sell any common stock in a financing conducted as an underwritten public offering or a private placement (in each case for cash and other than transactions with strategic investors) for a consideration per share that is 90% or less than the current market price on the date of such issuance, or shall issue securities convertible into common stock having an exercise price per share that is 90% or less than the current market price at the date of issuance of such convertible security, the exercise price to be in effect after such issuance or sale shall be determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (y) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the company for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold (or issuable on conversion) would purchase at the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (2) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale and the number of additional shares of common stock to be issued or sold (or, in the case of convertible securities, issued on conversion). notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise price shall not be adjusted as a result of the circumstances described in this section 4(b)(i) if the hmtf holders shall be offered the opportunity to purchase their pro rata portion (based on the percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock represented by the warrants then held by such hmtf holders on an as-exercised basis) of such offering. the preemptive right set forth in the preceding sentence shall be deemed waived as to an hmtf holder if such hmtf holder does not respond in a timely fashion to notice of the pricing of the offering to which the preemptive right would otherwise apply. (ii) if the company shall offer or issue rights or warrants to all holders of its outstanding shares of common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price (as defined in section 4(f) (iii)) on the common stock record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the exercise price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the date after such common stock record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of common stock subject to such rights or warrants would purchase at such current market price and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the common stock record date plus the total number of additional shares of common stock subject to such rights or warrants for subscription or purchase. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to purchase or receive such rights or warrants. to the extent that shares of common stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of common stock actually delivered. if such rights or warrants are not so issued, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at less than such current market price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of common stock, there shall be taken into account (x) any consideration received for such rights or warrants, with the value of such consideration and the amount of such exercise page 3 or subscription price, if other than cash, to be determined by the board of directors and (y) the amount of any exercise price or subscription price required to be paid upon exercise of such warrants or rights. (c) if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (d) (i) if the company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its shares of common stock any class of capital stock of the company (other than any dividends or distributions to which section 4(a) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness, cash or other assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants of a type referred to in section 4(b)(ii) and dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash and excluding any capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, cash or assets distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which section 4(k) applies) (the foregoing hereinafter in this section 4(d) called the "distributed securities"), then, in each such case, the exercise price shall be reduced so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the common stock record date with respect to such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price (determined as provided in section 4(f)(iii)) on such date less the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) on such date of the portion of the distributed securities so distributed applicable to one share of common stock and the denominator shall be such current market price, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the common stock record date; provided, however, that, in the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the distributed securities so distributed applicable to one share of common stock is equal to or greater than the current market price on the common stock record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each warrantholder shall have the right to receive upon exercise of such warrant (or any portion thereof) the amount of distributed securities such holder would have received had such holder exercised such warrant (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such common stock record date. if such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. if the board of directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this section 4(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities constituting all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the current market price pursuant to section 4(f)(iii) to the extent possible. (ii) options, rights or warrants distributed by the company to all holders of shares of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which options, rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("dilution trigger event"): (a) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock; (b) are not exercisable; and (c) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares of common stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 4(d)(ii) (and no adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4(d)(ii) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest dilution trigger event, whereupon such options, rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4(d)(ii) shall be made. if any such options, rights or warrants, including any such existing options, rights or warrants distributed prior to the first issuance of the warrants, are subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of each of which such options, rights or warrants shall become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be such date of issuance and record date with respect to new options, rights or warrants (and a termination or expiration of the existing options, rights or warrants, without exercise by the holder thereof). in addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of options, rights or warrants, or any dilution trigger event with respect thereto, that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the exercise price under this section 4 was made, (1) in the case of any such options, rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the exercise price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or dilution trigger event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of shares of common stock with respect to such options, rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained page 4 such options, rights or warrants), made to all holders of shares of common stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such options, rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the exercise price shall be readjusted as if such options, rights and warrants had not been issued. (iii) notwithstanding any other provision of this section 4(d) to the contrary, options, rights, warrants, evidences of indebtedness, other securities, cash or other assets (including, without limitation, any rights distributed pursuant to any shareholder rights plan) shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 4(d) if the company makes proper provision so that each warrantholder who exercises such warrants (or any portion thereof) after the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be entitled to receive upon such exercise, in addition to the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise, the amount and kind of such distributions that such holder would have been entitled to receive if such holder had, immediately prior to such determination date, exercised such warrants. (iv) for purposes of this section 4(d) and sections 4(a) and 4(b),any dividend or distribution to which this section 4(d) is applicable that also includes shares of common stock, or options, rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock to which 4(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (a) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants other than such shares of common stock or options, rights or warrants to which section 4(b) applies (and any exercise price reduction required by this section 4(d)(iv) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (b) a dividend or distribution of such shares of common stock or such options, rights or warrants (and any further exercise price reduction required by sections 4(a) or 4(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except that (1) the common stock record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the common stock record date fixed for such determination" and "the common stock record date" within the meaning of section 4(a) and as "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants", "the common stock record date fixed for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants" and "such common stock record date" for purposes of section 4(b), and (2) any shares of common stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" for the purposes of section 4(a). (e) if a tender offer made by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the common stock expires and such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) requires the payment to shareholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of purchased shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) that, combined together with the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) as of the expiration of such tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the shares of common stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this section 4(e) has been made, exceeds 5% of the income of the company reported for the 12 month period ending with the fiscal quarter next preceding such payment (the "12 month net income") (determined as of the last time (the "expiration time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended)), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the expiration time, the exercise price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the expiration time by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the expiration time multiplied by the current market price of a share of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the expiration time and the denominator shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "purchased shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of common stock outstanding (less any purchased shares) at the expiration time and the current market price of the shares of common stock on the trading day next succeeding the expiration time, such reduction (if any) to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the expiration time. if the company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the exercise price shall again be adjusted to be the exercise price which would then page 5 be in effect if such tender offer had not been made. if the application of this section 4(e) to any tender offer would result in an increase in the exercise price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this section 4(e). (f) for purposes of this section 4, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: (i) "closing price" with respect to any securities on any day means the closing sale price as of 4:00 p.m. eastern time on such day or any earlier final closing on such day or, if no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported high and low bid prices on such day, in each case on the nasdaq national market, or the new york stock exchange, as applicable, or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on such national market or exchange, on the national stock exchange or commission recognized trading market in the united states on which such security is quoted or listed or admitted to trading, or, if not quoted or listed or admitted to trading on any national stock exchange or commission recognized trading market in the united states, the average of the high and low bid prices of such security on the over-the-counter market on the day in question as reported by the national quotation bureau incorporated or a similar generally accepted reporting service in the united states, or, if not so available, in such manner as furnished by any new york stock exchange member firm selected from time to time by the board of directors for that purpose, or a price determined in good faith by the board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors. (ii) "common stock record date" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of common stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the common stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the board of directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). (iii) "current market price" means the average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock for the 10 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date in question; provided, however, that (a) if the "ex" date (as hereinafter defined) for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e) occurs during such 10 consecutive trading days, the closing price for each trading day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the same fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, (b) if the "ex" date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e) occurs on or after the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event and (c) if the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this proviso, the closing price for each trading day on or after such "ex" date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the amount of any cash and the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors in a manner consistent with any good faith determination of such value for purposes of section 4(d), whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the board of directors) of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock or assets being distributed applicable to one share of common stock as of the close of business on the day before such "ex" date. for purposes of any computation under section 4(e), the current market price on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock for such day and the next two succeeding trading days; provided, however, that, if the "ex" date for any event (other than the tender offer requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e), occurs on or after the expiration time for the tender or exchange offer requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event. for purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex" date (1) when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the closing price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, (2) when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of common stock, means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective and (3) when used with respect to any tender or exchange offer means the first date on which the shares of common stock trade regular way on such page 6 exchange or in such market after the expiration time of such offer. notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever successive adjustments to the exercise price are called for pursuant to this section 4, such adjustments shall be made to the current market price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this section 4 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the board of directors. (iv) "fair market value" means the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction. (g) no adjustment in the exercise price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this section 4(g) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this section 4 shall be made by the company and shall be made to the nearest cent. no adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the common stock. (h) whenever the exercise price is adjusted as herein provided, the company shall promptly file with the registrar an officers' certificate setting forth the exercise price after such adjustment and the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant will be exercisable after such adjustment pursuant to section 4(e) and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. promptly after delivery of such certificate, the company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the exercise price setting forth the adjusted exercise price and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the exercise price to each warrantholder at such holder's last address appearing on the register of holders maintained for that purpose within 20 days of the effective date of such adjustment. failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment. (i) in any case in which this section 4 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a common stock record date for an event, the company may defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to the holder of any warrant exercised after such common stock record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment. (j) for purposes of this section 4, the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company. the company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in the treasury of the company. (k) in case of any consolidation of the company with, or merger of the company into, any other person, or in case of any merger of another person into the company (other than a merger that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancelation of outstanding shares of common stock of the company), or in case of any sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the company, the warrantholders shall have the right thereafter, during the period such warrant shall be exercisable as specified in section 2(a), to convert such warrants into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the company for which the warrants might have been exercised immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, assuming such holder of shares of common stock of the company failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer (provided that, if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer is not the same for each share of common stock of the company in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("nonelecting share"), then for the purpose of this section 4(k) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer by each nonelecting share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the nonelecting shares). such securities shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of the triggering event, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4(k). the above provisions of this section 4(k) shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, conveyances or transfers. (l) upon each adjustment of the exercise price as a result of the operation of this section 4, this warrant shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted exercise price, that number of shares of common stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares covered by this warrant immediately prior to this adjustment by the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product so obtained by the exercise price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the exercise price. 5. notice of certain events. if at any time prior to the termination page 7 or full exercise of this warrant: (a) the company shall declare any dividend payable in stock upon its common stock, make any distribution to the holders of its common stock or offer for subscription pro rata to holders of common stock any additional shares of stock of any class or other rights; (b) there shall be any reclassification of the common stock of the company; (c) there shall be any consolidation or merger of the company with or into, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation; (d) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company; or (e) there shall be a public offering; then, in any one or more of such cases, the company shall give the holder at least 10 days' prior written notice of the date on which the books of the company shall close or a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights or for determining rights to vote in respect to any such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up or of the date of a filing of a registration statement under the securities act for a public offering. such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause shall also specify, in the case of any such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, the date on which the holders shall be entitled thereto, and such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause shall also specify the date on which the holders shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, as the case may be. each such written notice shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepared, addressed to the holder at the address of the holder as shown on the books of the company. 6. transfer of warrants.

(b) warrant agent. the company may, by written notice to the holder, appoint an agent for the purpose of maintaining the warrant register referred to in section 6(a) above, issuing any other securities then issuable upon the exercise of this warrant, exchanging this warrant, replacing this warrant or any or all of the foregoing. thereafter, any such registration, issuance or replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at the office of such agent.

(d) exchange of warrant upon a transfer. on surrender of this warrant for exchange, properly endorsed on the assignment form and subject to the provisions of this warrant with respect to compliance with the securities act, the company at its expense shall issue to or on the order of the holder a new warrant or warrants of like tenor, in the name of the holder or as the holders (on payment by the holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may direct, exercisable for the number of shares issuable upon the exercise hereof. 7. registration rights. if the holder of this warrant is a party to, or an assignee of rights under, that certain registration rights agreement, dated march 16, 2000 (the "registration rights agreement"), such holder shall be entitled to include any shares of common stock or other securities received upon exercise of the warrant with such holder's registrable securities (as such term is defined in the registration rights agreement), on the terms and conditions as set forth in the registration rights agreement. 8. amendment and waivers. no amendment, modification or termination of this warrant shall be binding unless executed in writing by the company and the warrantholder intending to be bound thereby. 9. waivers and extensions. any provision of this warrant may be amended, waived or modified only if such amendment, waiver or modification is in writing, is signed by the party intending to be bound, and specifically refers to this warrant. waivers may be made in advance or after the right waived has page 8 arisen or the breach or default waived has occurred. any waiver may be conditional. no waiver of any breach of any agreement or provision herein contained shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach thereof nor of any other agreement or provision herein contained. no waiver or extension of time for performance of any obligations or acts shall be deemed a waiver or extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or acts. 10. termination. the right to exercise this warrant shall expire and shall be void at 5:00 p.m. new york city time on march 16, 2007. 11. reservation of stock. the company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance upon exercise of this warrant, all shares of common stock or other securities from time to time issuable upon exercise of this warrant and, subject to any existing contractual limitations, from time to time, will take all steps necessary to amend its certificate of incorporation to provide sufficient reserves of shares of common stock or other securities issuable upon exercise of this warrant. the company further covenants that all shares that may be issued upon the exercise of rights represented by this warrant and payment of the exercise price, as set forth herein, will be fully paid and non-assessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges in respect of the issue thereof. the company also agrees that its issuance of this warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of common stock upon exercise of this warrant. 12. replacement. on receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of this warrant and, in the case of loss, theft, or destruction, on delivery of any indemnity agreement or bond reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the company or, in the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this warrant, the company at its expense will execute and deliver, in lieu of this warrant, a new warrant of like tenor. 13. no rights as stockholder. except as provided in section 2 or 4, no holder of this warrant, as such, shall be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be considered a stockholder of the company for any purpose, nor shall anything in this warrant be construed to confer on any holder of this warrant as such, any rights of a stockholder of the company or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action, to receive notice of meeting of stockholders, to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise. 14. miscellaneous provisions.

(a) if the adoption of or any change in any requirement of law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any lender or the issuing bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other governmental authority made subsequent to the date hereof: (i) shall subject any lender or the issuing bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this agreement, any letter of credit or any eurodollar loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such lender or issuing bank in respect thereof (except non-excluded taxes covered by section 2.14, the establishment of a tax based on the net income of such lender or issuing bank and changes in the rate of tax on the net income of such lender or issuing bank); (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the eurodollar rate hereunder or on any issuing lender with respect to any letter of credit; or (iii) shall impose on such lender or issuing bank any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such lender or issuing bank, by an amount which such lender or issuing bank deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining eurodollar loans or to increase the cost to such lender or issuing bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining letters of credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the applicable borrower shall promptly pay such lender or the issuing bank, as the case may be, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such lender or issuing bank for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. if a borrower notifies the administrative agent within five business days after any lender notifies such borrower of any increased cost pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section 2.13(a), such borrower may covert all eurodollar loans of such lender then outstanding into abr loans in accordance with section 2.7 and shall, additionally, reimburse such lender for any cost in accordance with section 2.15.

(c) a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this section 2.13 showing in reasonable detail the calculation thereof and certifying that it is generally charging such costs to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities submitted by any lender or issuing bank to the borrowers through the administrative agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error, provided that the determination of such amounts shall be made in good faith in a manner generally consistent with such lender's or issuing bank's standard practices. the obligations of the borrowers pursuant to this section 2.13 shall survive the termination of this agreement and the payment of the term loans and all other amounts payable hereunder for a period of nine months thereafter. if any lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this section 2.13, it shall promptly (and in any event no later than 90 days after such lender becomes entitled to make such claim) notify the borrowers through the administrative agent of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. section 2.14 taxes.

(c) if the administrative agent or any lender receives a refund in respect of non-excluded taxes paid by any borrower, which in the good faith judgment of such lender is allocable to such payment, it shall promptly pay such refund, together with any other amounts paid by the borrowers in connection with such refunded non-excluded taxes, to the borrowers, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such lender incurred in obtaining such refund, provided, however, that each borrower agrees to promptly return such refund to the administrative agent or the applicable lender, as the case may be, if it receives notice from the administrative agent or applicable lender that such administrative agent or lender is required to repay such refund. section 2.15 indemnity. each borrower agrees to indemnify each lender and to hold each lender harmless from any loss (excluding loss of profit) or expense which such lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by any borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of eurodollar loans after such borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, (b) default by any borrower in making any prepayment after such borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of eurodollar loans on a day which is not the last day of an interest period with respect thereto. such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such interest period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the interest period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such loans provided for herein (excluding, however, any margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such lender) which would have accrued to such lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. a certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this section 2.15, showing in reasonable detail the calculation thereof, submitted to the borrowers by any lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. this covenant shall survive the termination of this agreement and the payment of the loans and all other amounts payable hereunder for a period of nine months thereafter. section 2.16 change of lending office. each lender agrees that if it makes any demand for payment under section 2.14(a), or if any adoption or change of the type described in section 2.13 shall occur with respect to it, it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions and so long as such efforts would not be disadvantageous to it, as determined in its reasonable discretion) to designate a different lending office if the making of such a designation would reduce or obviate the need for the borrowers to make payments under section 2.14(a), or would eliminate or reduce the effect of any adoption or change described in section 2.13. section 2.17 replacement of lenders. if, at any time (a) the borrowers become obligated to pay additional amounts described in sections 2.13 or 2.14 as a result of any conditions described in such sections, (b) any lender becomes insolvent and its assets become subject to a receiver, liquidator, trustee, custodian or other person having similar powers, (c) any lender becomes a "nonconsenting lender" (as defined below in this section 2.17) or (d) any lender becomes a non-funding lender, then the borrowers may, on ten business days' prior written notice to the administrative agent and such lender, replace such lender by causing such lender to (and such lender shall) assign pursuant to section 9.4(b) all of its rights and obligations under this agreement to a lender or other entity selected by the borrowers and reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent for a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal page 17 amount of such lender's loans and all accrued interest and fees and other amounts payable hereunder; provided that (i) the borrowers shall have no right to replace the administrative agent, (ii) neither the administrative agent nor any lender shall have any obligation to the borrower to find a replacement lender or other such entity, (iii) in the event of replacement of a nonconsenting lender or a lender to which the borrowers become obligated to pay additional amounts pursuant to clause (a) of this section, in order for the borrowers to be entitled to replace such a lender, such replacement must take place no later than 180 days after (a) the date the nonconsenting lender shall have notified the borrowers and the administrative agent of its failure to agree to any requested consent, waiver or amendment or (b) the lender shall have demanded payment of additional amounts under one of the sections described in clause (a) of this section, as the case may be and (iv) in no event shall the lender hereby replaced be required to pay or surrender to such replacement lender or other entity any of the fees received by such lender hereby replaced pursuant to this agreement. in the case of a replacement of a lender to which the borrower becomes obligated to pay additional amounts pursuant to clause (a) of this section, the borrower shall pay such additional amounts to such lender prior to such lender being replaced and the payment of such additional amounts shall be a condition to the replacement of such lender. in the event that (x) the borrower or the administrative agent has requested the lenders to consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the loan documents or to agree to any amendment thereto, (y) the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the consent of all lenders and (z) the required lenders have agreed to such consent, waiver or amendment, then any such lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment shall be deemed a "nonconsenting lender". the borrower's right to replace a non-funding lender pursuant to this section 2.17 is, and shall be, in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other rights and remedies available to the borrower against such non-funding lender under this agreement, at law, in equity, or by statute. section 2.18 nature of obligations.
