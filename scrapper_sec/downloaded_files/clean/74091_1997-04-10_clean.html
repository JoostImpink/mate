subsidiary, union oil company of california, has been convicted of a number of misdemeanor criminal violations. these cases usually involved minor violations of state or local enviornmental laws. however, two of these misdemeanor convictions were significant. in 1994, union plead no contest to a number of misdemeanor violations of california statutes which prohibit the discharge of petroleum into the environment. the case was filed in municipal court for the county of san luis obispo, california. fines and civil penalties in excess of $1,000,000 were paid to resolve the violations. on july 19, 1995, union plead no contest to a number of misdemeanor violations of claifornia state laws which prohibit the unlawful discharge of airborne contaminants into the environment. the case was filed in municipal court for the county of contra costa, california. a fine of $951,000 was paid to resolve the violations. in addition, civil penalties in the amount of $2,050,000 were paid in a companion civil case. a wholly owned subsidiary of unocal, puregro, plead guilty in january 1993 in federal district court, san diego, california, to one felony count for illegal disposal of hazardous waste. puregro paid a fine of $100,000, plus costs in the amount of approximately $20,000. page 5 of 6 e. to the best knowledge of union and unocal, as the case may be, neither has been the subject of

such laws, during the last five years. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration ------------------------------------------------- the aggregate amount of consideration used by union to purchase the 14,092,482 shares to which this statement relates was approximately $400,000,000. the consideration was obtained from the sale of the business and assets of union's 76 products company business segment. item 4. purpose of transaction ---------------------- the 14,092,482 shares were received as partial consideration for the sale of the business and assets of union's 76 products company business segment. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer ------------------------------------ a. amount beneficially owned: 14,092,482 percent of class: 9.71% b. union oil company of california is a wholly owned subsidiary of unocal corporation, and therefore, unocal may be deemed to control union, directing its investments and voting. thus, the two entities share voting power and investment power with respect to the shares. c. to the best knowledge of union and unocal as the case may be, neither has effected any transactions in the shares during the 60 days prior to april 10, 1997, except as described herein. d. not applicable. e. not applicable. item 6 contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer

supplemented, union has agreed to vote the shares in proportion, for, against and in abstention, to the votes of the other shareholders present at shareholder meetings, if the vote relates to a matter on which the interests of union and the interests of the other shareholders are reasonably similar. in addition, if any person solicits written consent for action from shareholders of tosco, union has agreed to deliver page 6 of 6 a written consent consenting to the action by a percentage of the shares that is equal to the percentage by which all other shares, not held by union, consented to the action. further, union has agreed to certain passivity provisions, including its agreement not to sell, without the consent of tosco, the shares to anyone who, after completion of such sale, would own more than 5% of the common stock outstanding. tosco has agreed to repurchase the shares at various prices if tosco sells shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering under certain conditions. finally, the agreement provides certain registration rights with respect to the shares. item 7 materials to be filed as exhibits --------------------------------- exhibit a agreement of
