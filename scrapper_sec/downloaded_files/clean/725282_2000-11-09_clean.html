limitation of liability. no holder shall, based on being a holder of the warrant, be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of common stock or any other security of the company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise hereof for any purpose, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon the holder, as such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether upon any recapitalization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, change to or of par value, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise) or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise until the warrant shall have been exercised in accordance with section 1 hereof. no provisions hereof, in the absence of affirmative action by the holder hereof to purchase shares of common stock, and no mere enumeration herein of rights or privileges of the holder hereof, shall give rise to any liability of such holder for the purchase price or as a shareholder of the company, whether such liability is asserted by the company, creditors of the company or others. -5- 8. replacement of securities. upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificates evidencing ownership of the warrant and in the event of any such loss, theft or destruction upon delivery of an indemnity agreement or, if the holder so elects, a surety bond reasonably satisfactory to the company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of any such certificate, the company shall forthwith execute and deliver in lieu thereof a new warrant of like tenor. 9. change; waiver; applicable law. the warrant and any term hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. the warrant shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of new york. 10. notices. any notice to be given to the company under the terms hereof shall be addressed to the company in care of its president at 201 ann street, suite 210, hartford, ct 06103, and any notice to the holder shall be addressed to its address as reflected on the records of the company, or at such other address as the company, the holder and its permitted successors or assigns may hereafter designate in writing to the other. any such notice shall have been deemed given upon personal delivery or on the third business day after being enclosed in a properly sealed envelope or wrapper properly addressed, registered or certified and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the united states government. 11. form of election to exercise warrant. the form to be used in the event the holder hereof desires to exercise the warrant is attached hereto as exhibit "a". -6- in witness whereof, the company has caused the warrant to be signed in its name by its president or a duly authorized vice president. dated: november 1, 2000 company: mdi entertainment, inc., a delaware corporation by: /s/ steven m. saferin ------------------------------------- name: steven m. saferin title: president and chief executive officer [corporate seal] attest: /s/ kenneth m. przysiecki - ---------------------------- holder: elot, inc. by: /s/ robert daum ------------------------------------ name: robert daum title: executive vice president exhibit a subscription notice the undersigned, the holder of the foregoing warrant, hereby elects to exercise purchase rights represented by such warrant for, and to purchase thereunder, __________________________________ (_____________________) shares of the common stock covered by such warrant and herewith makes payment in full therefor in the amount of __________________________________________ dollars ($________________) in cash or check made payable to the company, and requests that one or more certificates for such shares (and any securities or property deliverable upon such exercise) be issued in the name of and delivered to the undersigned, whose address is __________________________________ _________________________________. the undersigned agrees that, in the absence of an effective registration statement with respect to common stock issued upon the exercise, the undersigned is acquiring such common stock for investment and not with a view to distribution thereof and that the certificate or certificates representing such common stock may bear a legend substantially as follows: "neither the warrant nor the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant have been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"). neither the warrant nor such shares may be sold, transferred, pledged or hypothecated in the absence of an effective registration statement for the shares under the act or otherwise in compliance with the act." dated: ____________________ [holder] by: ----------------------------------- name: title: address: ------------------------------ ------------------------------ ex-3 4 0004.txt certificate of descrip. and designation description and designation of series b preferred stock 1. designation and definitions. (a) designation. a total of 444 shares of the corporation's previously undesignated preferred stock, $.001 par value, shall be designated as the "series b preferred stock." the original issue price per share of the series b preferred stock shall be deemed to be $3,003 (the "original issue price"). (b) certain definitions. as used herein, the following terms, unless the context otherwise requires, have the following respective meanings: (i) "common stock" means the common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the corporation. (ii) "conversion date" means each date on which the corporation receives by telecopy written notice in accordance with section 5(g) hereof from a holder of series b preferred stock that such holder elects to convert shares of its series b preferred stock. (iii) "issue date" means, with respect to each share of series b preferred stock held by any holder, the date on which the corporation originally issued such share to a holder (regardless of the number of times transfer of such share is made on the stock transfer books maintained by or for the corporation, and regardless of the number of certificates which may be issued to evidence such share, and irrespective of any subsequent transfer or other disposition of such share to any other holder). 2. dividends. (a) the series b preferred stock shall not bear any dividends. (b) if the board of directors shall declare any dividend or distribution payable upon the then outstanding shares of common stock, the holders of the series b preferred stock shall be entitled to the amount of dividends and distributions on the series b preferred stock as would be declared payable on the largest number of whole shares of common stock into which the shares of series b preferred stock held by each holder thereof could be converted pursuant to the provisions of section 5 hereof, such number determined as of the record date for the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive such dividend. such determination of "whole shares" shall be based upon the aggregate number of shares of series b preferred stock held by each holder, and not upon each share of series b preferred stock so held by the holder. -2- (c) subject to the foregoing provisions of this section 2, the board of directors may declare and the corporation may pay or set apart for payment, or cause the accrual of, stated or cumulative dividends and other distributions on any other series of preferred stock hereafter designated, and may purchase or otherwise redeem any of the same (or any warrants, rights, options or other securities exercisable therefor or convertible or exchangeable thereinto), and the holders of series b preferred stock shall not be entitled to share therein. 3. liquidation, dissolution or winding up. (a) treatment at liquidation, dissolution or winding up. in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, or in the event of its insolvency, before any distribution or payment is made to any holders of common stock or any other class or series of capital stock of the corporation designated to be junior to the series b preferred stock, and subject to the liquidation rights and preferences of any class or series of preferred stock designated by the board of directors in the future to be senior ("senior stock") to or on a parity ("pari passu stock") with the series b preferred stock with respect to liquidation preferences, the holder of each share of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to be paid first out of the assets of the corporation available for distribution to holders of the corporation's capital stock of all classes, whether such assets are capital, surplus or earnings, an amount equal to $2252.25 per share (the "liquidation value"). if, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the assets of the corporation available for distribution to its stockholders after appropriate deduction is made for payment in full of the liquidation preference of all senior stock shall be insufficient to pay the holders of the series b preferred stock and any pari passu stock the full amount to which they otherwise would be entitled, the holders of series b preferred stock and any pari passu stock shall share ratably in any distribution of available assets pro rata in proportion to the respective liquidation preference amounts which would otherwise be payable upon liquidation with respect to the outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock and any pari passu stock if all liquidation preference amounts with respect to such shares were paid in full, based upon the aggregate liquidation value payable upon all shares of series b preferred stock and pari passu stock then outstanding. after such payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the senior stock, series b preferred stock and any pari passu stock, or funds necessary for such payment shall have been set aside by the corporation in trust for the account of holders of the series b preferred stock so as to be available for such payment, the remaining assets available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the common stock and any class or series of capital stock designated to be junior to the series b preferred stock (if any) in right of payment upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation. -3- the amounts set forth above shall be subject to equitable adjustment by the board of directors whenever there shall occur a stock dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event involving a change in the capital structure of the series b preferred stock. (b) distributions other than cash. whenever the distributions provided for in this section shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the board of directors. all distributions (including distributions other than cash) made hereunder shall be made pro rata to the holders of series b preferred stock. (c) merger. if any merger or consolidation of the corporation into or with another corporation shall occur and in such merger or consolidation, the corporation's common stock shall be converted or exchanged into stock, securities or other property, the series b preferred stock shall be converted into the same such stock, securities or property in an amount per share equal to the largest number of whole shares of common stock into which such holder's shares of series b preferred stock could be converted on the date of such transaction. 4. voting power. (a) general. except as otherwise expressly provided in this section 4 or as otherwise required by the general corporation law of the state of delaware, each holder of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters and shall be entitled to that number of votes equal to the largest number of whole shares of common stock into which such holder's shares of series b preferred stock could be converted, pursuant to the provisions of section 5 hereof, at the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on any matter or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders is solicited. except as otherwise expressly required by law, the holders of shares of series b preferred stock and common stock shall vote together (or render written consents in lieu of a vote) as a single class on all matters submitted to the stockholders of the corporation. such determination of "whole shares" shall be based upon the aggregate number of shares of series b preferred stock held by each holder, and not upon each share of series b preferred stock so held by the holder. (b) amendments to charter. for so long as there are any shares of series b preferred stock outstanding, the corporation shall not amend its certificate of incorporation or this certificate of designation in any manner adverse to the holders of series b preferred stock (including, without limitation, pursuant to or as a result of any merger, consolidation or otherwise) without the approval, by vote or written consent, of the holders of at least -4- a majority of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred stock, voting together as a class, each share of series b preferred stock to be entitled to one vote in each instance. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the creation, or increase in the authorized number of shares, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to or on a parity with the series b preferred stock either as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be deemed not to adversely affect the rights of the holders of series b preferred stock for purposes of this section 4(b). 5. conversion rights. (a) conversion. each holder of series b preferred stock shall have the right, at such holder's option, to convert at any time any of the shares of series b preferred stock held by such holder into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of series b preferred stock to be converted by the conversion ratio (as defined below). (b) conversion ratio. the conversion ratio (the "conversion ratio") shall initially be 1001. the initial conversion price shall be subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of common stock into which the series b preferred stock is convertible, as hereinafter provided. (c) automatic conversion. each share of series b preferred stock shall automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the then effective conversion price on the first anniversary of the issue date. (d) adjustment for subdivisions, combinations or consolidations of common stock. in the event of a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise), the conversion ratio in effect immediately prior to the record date or effectiveness, as the case may be, of such subdivision shall, concurrently with such record date or effectiveness, be proportionately increased. in the event the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined or consolidated (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of common stock, the conversion ratio in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately decreased. (e) adjustment for reclassification, exchange, or substitution. in the event that at any time or from time to time after the issue date, the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series b preferred stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above or stock dividend, or a merger, consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each such share of series b preferred stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other -5- securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of series b preferred stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. (f) certificate as to adjustments; notice by corporation. in each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the conversion ratio, the corporation at its expense will furnish each holder of series b preferred stock so affected with a certificate prepared by an officer of the corporation, showing such adjustment or readjustment, and stating in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. (g) exercise of conversion privilege. to exercise its conversion privilege, a holder of series b preferred stock shall give written notice by telecopy to the corporation at its principal office that such holder elects to convert shares of its series b preferred stock and shall thereafter surrender the original certificate(s) representing the shares being converted to the corporation at its principal office together with an originally executed copy of such notice. such notice shall also state the name or names (with its address or addresses, as well as the address(es) for delivery) in which the certificate(s) for shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be issued. the certificate(s) for the shares of series b preferred stock surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by proper assignment thereof to the corporation or in blank. as promptly as practicable after the corporation receives the original certificate(s) for the shares of series b preferred stock surrendered for conversion, the proper assignment thereof to the corporation or in blank and the original notice of conversion (collectively, the "original documentation"), but in no event more than three (3) business days after the corporation's receipt of the original documentation, the corporation shall issue and shall deliver to the holder of the shares of series b preferred stock being converted, at the addresses set forth therefor by the holder, such certificate(s) as it may request for the number of whole shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares of series b preferred stock in accordance with the provisions of this section 5, and cash, as provided in section 5(h), in respect of any fraction of a share of common stock issuable upon such conversion. such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the conversion date, and at such time the rights of the holder as holder of the converted shares of series b preferred stock shall cease and the person(s) in whose name(s) any certificate(s) for shares of common stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of the shares of common stock represented thereby. (h) cash in lieu of fractional shares. no fractional shares of common stock or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of shares of series b preferred stock. instead of any fractional shares of common stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of series b preferred stock, the corporation shall pay to -6- the holder of the shares of series b preferred stock being converted a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional shares in an amount equal to the same fraction of the market price per share of the common stock (as determined in a reasonable manner prescribed by the board of directors) at the close of business on the conversion date. the determination as to whether or not any fractional shares are issuable shall be based upon the aggregate number of shares of series b preferred stock being converted at any one time by any holder thereof, not upon each share of series b preferred stock being converted. (i) partial conversion. in the event some but not all of the shares of series b preferred stock represented by a certificate(s) surrendered by a holder are converted, the corporation shall execute and deliver to or on the order of the holder, at the expense of the corporation, a new certificate representing the number of shares of series b preferred stock which were not converted. such new certificate shall be so delivered on or prior to the date set forth in section 5(h) for the delivery of certificates for shares of common stock. (j) reservation of common stock. the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the series b preferred stock, such number of its shares of common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock (including any shares of series b preferred stock represented by any warrants, options, subscription or purchase rights for the series b preferred stock), and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock (including any shares of series b preferred stock represented by any warrants, options, subscriptions or purchase rights for the series b preferred stock), then the corporation shall be deemed to be in breach and default of its obligations hereunder, and in addition to all charges, claims and rights at law or in equity that each holder shall be entitled to, the corporation shall use all means reasonably available to it, and promptly take any and all actions as may be necessary, to increase its authorized but unissued shares of common stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose. 6. redemption and repurchase rights. the corporation shall have no right to redeem, and holders of shares of series b preferred stock shall have no right to cause the corporation to redeem, any or all of the outstanding shares of series b preferred stock. 7. notices of record date. in the event of any: (a) taking by the corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or -7- (b) capital reorganization of the corporation, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the corporation, any merger or consolidation of the corporation, or any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation to any other corporation, or any other entity or person, or (c) voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation, then and in each such event the corporation shall telecopy and thereafter mail or cause to be mailed to each holder of series b preferred stock a notice specifying (i) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right and a description of such dividend, distribution or right, (ii) the date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (iii) the time, if any, that is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of common stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. such notice shall be telecopied and thereafter mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, or by express overnight courier service, at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified in such notice on which such action is to be taken. 8. general. (a) replacement of certificates. upon the corporation's receipt, from the holder of any certificate evidencing shares of series b preferred stock, of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the corporation (an affidavit of such holder will be satisfactory) of the ownership and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such certificate, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the corporation, and in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender of such certificate, the corporation (at its expense) shall execute and deliver to such holder, in lieu of such certificate, a new certificate that represents the number of shares represented by, is dated the date of, is issued in the name of the holder of, and is substantially identical in form of, such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate. (b) payment of taxes. the corporation shall pay all taxes (other than taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection with the issuance or delivery of any shares of common stock (or other of the corporation's securities) that results from the conversion of shares of series b preferred stock pursuant to this certificate of designation. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation, pursuant to a notice from a holder of any shares of series b preferred stock, effects the issuance or delivery of any shares of common stock (or other of the corporation's securities) in any name(s) -8- other than such holder's name, then such holder shall deliver to the corporation with the aforesaid notice (a) all transfer taxes and other governmental charges payable upon the issuance or delivery of securities in such other name(s) or (b) evidence satisfactory to the corporation that such taxes and charges have been or shall be paid in full. (c) status of converted shares. shares of series b preferred stock that are converted or otherwise acquired by the corporation in any manner (including by purchase or exchange) shall be canceled and upon cancellation (i) shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) shall become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock undesignated as to series and (iii) may be reissued as part of another series of preferred stock.

(h) the period of distribution of shares in a firm commitment or best efforts underwritten public offering shall be deemed to extend until each underwriter has completed the distribution of all securities purchased by it, and the period of distribution of shares in any other registration shall be deemed to extend until the sale of all shares covered thereby. 2.4. furnish information. the holder shall furnish to the company such information regarding it, the shares held by it, and the intended method of disposition thereof as the company shall reasonably request to assure compliance with federal and applicable state securities laws. 2.5. expenses of demand registration. all expenses incurred in connection with any registration, whether pursuant to section 2.1, 2.2 or 2.10, including without limitation all registration and qualification fees, printing and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, and fees and disbursements of one special counsel selected by and for the holder (if different from counsel for the company), shall be borne by the company. 2.6. underwriting requirements. in connection with any offering involving an underwriting of common stock being issued by the company under section 2.2, the company -4- shall not be required under section 2.2 to include any of the holder's securities therein unless they accept and agree to the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the company and the underwriters selected by it, and then only in such quantity as will not, in the opinion of the underwriters, materially adversely affect the marketing of the offering by the company. if the total number of shares which the holder requests to be included in any offering exceeds the number of such shares which the underwriters reasonably believe would not materially adversely affect the marketing of the offering, the company shall only be required to include in the offering so many of the shares as the underwriters believe will not jeopardize the success of the offering. 2.7. indemnification. in the event any of the shares are included in a registration statement under this section 2: (a) the company will indemnify and hold harmless the holder against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which it may become subject under the act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or actions in respect thereof arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein, or allegedly necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse the holder for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 2.7(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in connection with such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by the holder. (b) to the extent permitted by law, the holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed such registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the act, and any underwriter for the company (within the meaning of the act) against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person or underwriter may become subject, under the act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or allegedly necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in such registration statement, preliminary -5- prospectus, or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by the holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and the holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person or underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially determined that there were material misstatements or omissions. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 2.7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 2.7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties. the failure to notify an indemnifying party promptly of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to the ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party under this section 2.7, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve such party of any liability which such party may have to any indemnified party otherwise other than under this section 2.7. (d) if recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution to liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under section 11(d) of the act. in determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, there shall be considered the relative benefits received by each party from the offering of the securities (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering realized by each), the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement of omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances; provided that in no event will the holder be required to contribute an amount in excess of the original cost that the company incurred arising from the inclusion of the holder's shares in that offering. the company and the underwriters agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. 2.8. reports under the securities exchange act of 1934. with a view to making available to the holder the benefits of rule 144 promulgated under the act, the company shall (i) file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required to be filed by an issuer of securities registered under the act or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, (ii) maintain in effect the registration of its common stock under section 12 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and (iii) so long as the holder owns any of the shares, furnish in writing upon such holder's request the following information: (a) the company's name, address and telephone number, (b) the company's internal revenue service identification number, (c) the company's sec file number, (d) the number of shares of common stock outstanding as shown by the most recent report or statement published by the company, (e) the average weekly volume of trading in such shares reported on all national securities exchanges during the four calendar weeks preceding the date of receipt of request by the holder, -6- and (f) whether the company has filed all reports required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 during the preceding twelve months. with respect to a rule or regulation of the sec (other than rule 144) which may at any time permit the holder to sell common stock to the public without registration, the company agrees to take such action as is reasonable to enable utilization of such rule. 2.9. limitations on subsequent registration rights. from and after the date hereof, the company will not, without the prior written consent of the holder, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company which allows such holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company to include such securities in any registration filed under section 2.1 hereof, unless the terms of such agreement provide that such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of his securities will not diminish the amount of shares which are included. 2.10. registration on form s-3. in addition to the rights provided to the holders pursuant to section 2.1 hereof, if the company is then qualified for the registration of shares under the act on form s-3 (or any similar form promulgated by the sec), the holder will have the right to request registration of shares on form s-3. in such event, the company, as expeditiously as possible, will use its best efforts to effect qualification and registration on said form s-3 of all or such portion of the shares as the holder shall specify; provided, however, that no more than two (2) such registration statements need be filed in any twelve (12) month period and that no registration of shares shall be initiated under this section 2.10 until 120 days after the effective date of a registration statement filed pursuant to section 2.1, 2.2 or 2.10. 2.11. notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time or from time to time after the date of effectiveness of a registration statement covering the shares, the company notifies the holder in writing of the existence of a potential material event, the holder shall not offer to sell any shares, or engage in any other transaction involving or relating to the shares, from the time of the giving of notice with respect to a potential material event until such holder receives written notice from the company that such potential material event either has been disclosed to the public or no longer constitutes a potential material event; provided that the restrictions set forth in this sentence shall not apply for more than 90 days in any twelve month period and the 180 day effective period set forth in section 2.3(a) shall be extended for each day during which such restriction applies. a "potential material event" means any of the following: (a) the possession by the company of material information not ripe for disclosure in a registration statement, which shall be evidenced by determinations in good faith by the board of directors of the company that disclosure of such information in the registration statement would be detrimental to the business and affairs of the company; or (b) any material engagement or activity by the company which would, in the good faith determination of the board of directors of the company, be adversely affected by disclosure in a registration statement at such time, which determination shall be accompanied by a good faith determination by the board of directors of the company that the registration statement would be materially misleading absent the inclusion of such information. -7- 2.12. the holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of (i) any event of the kind described in section 2.11 or (ii) an event of which the company has knowledge, as a result of which the prospectus included the registration statement covering the shares, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such holder will immediately discontinue disposition of the shares pursuant the registration statement covering the shares until such holder's receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus. 2.13. the company's obligation to register the shares terminates (i) on the date when the holder may sell all of the shares without volume or manner of sale restrictions pursuant to rule 144 of the securities act or (ii) the date the holder no longer owns any of the shares. section 3 tag along rights on the date of this agreement, steven m. saferin owns 3,870,169 shares of common stock of the company. if mr. saferin (the "selling investor") shall receive and determine to accept any bona fide written offer (a "notice of offer") from a buyer (which shall include any person and its affiliates) to purchase or otherwise transfer for value, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, a number of shares equal to or greater than 5% of the common stock owned by him as of the date of this agreement, elot shall have the right to participate in such transaction in the manner set forth in this section;
