provided, however, that the company shall not terminate this agreement pursuant to section 8.1(d)(iii) hereof, and any purported termination pursuant to section 8.1(d)(iii) hereof shall be void and of no force or effect, unless (i) the company prior to or concurrently with such termination pays to parent the fee payable pursuant to section 8.2(b) and enters into a definitive agreement concerning the superior proposal; (ii) the company shall have complied in all material respects with this section 6.5(a), (iii) the company shall have given parent at least three business days written prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreement, attaching a description of all material terms and conditions of the superior proposal to such notice together with the most current draft of an agreement relating to such superior proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the amount or form of consideration of the superior proposal shall require a new notice and a new three business day period), (iv) during such three business days or greater period, the company engages in good faith negotiations with parent with respect to such changes 4 31 as parent may propose to the terms of the merger and this agreement, and (v) parent does not make prior to such termination of this agreement a definitive and binding offer to enter into a definitive agreement which the board of directors of the company determines, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the company as the superior proposal (it being understood that neither the delivery of a notice of a superior proposal in accordance with this section 6.5(b) nor any subsequent public announcement thereof shall in of themselves constitute an adverse recommendation change or a breach of clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the first sentence of this section 6.5(b)). the term "superior proposal" means any bona fide written acquisition proposal not solicited by or on behalf of the company or any of its subsidiaries made by a third party that the board of directors of the company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) would, if consummated, be superior from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the company, taking into account, among other things, any changes to the terms of this agreement proposed by parent in response to such superior proposal (provided that, for purposes of this definition of "superior proposal," the term acquisition proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this section 6.5, except that the reference to "more than 20%" in the definition of "acquisition proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority"). section 6.6 employment and employee benefits matters. (a) as of the effective time, the obligations of the company and its subsidiaries under each company plan and employment agreement shall continue as obligations of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries, respectively.

(d) without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under any employment agreement or company plan, parent shall cause the surviving corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the effective time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for any individual who is actively employed by the company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time (the "affected employees") (other than employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement) (i)compensation levels 5 32 (such term to include salary, bonus opportunities and commissions) that in the aggregate are no less favorable, (ii) company plans that in the aggregate are no less favorable, and (iii) severance plans that are no less favorable, than the overall compensation levels and company plans, and the severance plans, respectively, such affected employees are entitled to immediately prior to the effective time, and employees covered by collective bargaining agreements shall be provided with such benefits as shall be required under the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement; provided, however, subject to the foregoing, that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any company plan or interfere with the surviving corporation's right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable law. without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under any employment agreement or company plan after the expiration of such one-year period, parent shall provide affected employees (other than those covered by collective bargaining agreements) with employee benefits, in the aggregate, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the parent or its subsidiaries; provided that, notwithstanding any of the provisions set forth above, nothing herein shall require the establishment, amendment or continuation of any stock option, restricted stock, stock purchase, employee stock ownership or any other equity-based plan or program and the value of benefits of any such program shall not be included for purposes of determining whether (i), (ii) or (iii) above in the aggregate is "no less favorable". (e) affected employees shall be given credit for all service with the company and its subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by the company, under each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, including the vacation policies, of parent or its subsidiaries in which such affected employees are eligible to participate (the "parent plans") for all purposes; provided, however, that no such service shall be credited for purposes of determining benefit accruals with respect to any defined benefit pension plan except for any plan formerly maintained by the company to the extent such service is recognized under such plan or any successor thereof. with respect to each parent plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in section 3(1) of erisa), the parent or its subsidiaries shall (a) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (b) to the extent administratively feasible, give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, affected employees under similar plans maintained by the company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the closing date. (f) with respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any affected employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy applicable to such affected employee immediately prior to the closing date, parent and its subsidiaries shall assume the liability for such accrued vacation and allow such affected employee to use such accrued vacation in accordance with the provisions of the applicable vacation policy. notwithstanding the foregoing, such assumption and allowance for accrued but unused vacation time accrued before january 1, 2000 shall only take place if such accrued but unused vacation time has been documented in the applicable personnel files and records related to such affected employee. (g) the company shall take all action necessary to provide for full vesting of the account balances of all affected employees after one year of service under the harcourt savings plan (h) the company will amend the harcourt inc. severance pay plan, the harcourt general inc. manager/director change of control severance plan and the harcourt general inc. 6 33 employee change of control severance plan, and any other severance plan program or policy of the company or its subsidiaries not previously made available to parent, if such plan can be unilaterally amended by the company, in such manner as may be reasonably necessary to provide that no severance or termination benefits would be payable thereunder solely as a result of the merger or the subsequent transaction. section 6.7 directors' and officers' indemnification and insurance. (a) without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under any employment agreement or company plan, from the effective time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the effective time occurs, parent shall, or shall cause the surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the effective time) and former officer or director of the company and its subsidiaries (the "indemnified parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements (collectively, "costs"), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the indemnified party is or was an officer or director of the company or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time (including, without limitation, this agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time, provided that such indemnifications shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable law. each indemnified party will be entitled to advancement of reasonable expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from parent or the surviving corporation within ten business days of receipt by parent from the indemnified party of a request therefor; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the dgcl, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. (b) any indemnified party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this section 6.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the surviving corporation thereof; provided, however, that any indemnified party's failure to promptly notify the surviving corporation upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation shall only reduce such indemnified party's rights under paragraph (a) of this section 6.7 to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the surviving corporation's ability to defend such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. in the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the effective time), (i) the surviving corporation shall have the right, from and after the effective time, to assume the defense thereof (with counsel engaged by the surviving corporation to be reasonably acceptable to the relevant indemnified party) and the surviving corporation shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, (ii) such indemnified party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the surviving corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; provided that the surviving corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any indemnified party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such indemnified party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. the surviving corporation shall not, except with the consent of any indemnified party, enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the person or 7 34 persons making, asserting or conducting such claim, action suit, proceeding or investigation to such indemnified party an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation if such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is indemnifiable pursuant to section 6.7. notwithstanding the right of the surviving corporation to assume and control the defense of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and the surviving corporation shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel and shall pay such reasonable fees, costs and expenses promptly after receipt of an invoice from such indemnified party if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the surviving corporation to represent such indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably acceptable to such indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after notice of the relevant claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii) such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the surviving corporation. (c) the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the surviving corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the effective time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals. (d) without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under any written employment agreement, parent shall, or shall cause the surviving corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six years from the effective time the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the company (provided that parent or the surviving corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time, provided that if the aggregate annual premium for such insurance at any time during such period shall exceed 200% of the per annum rate of premium paid by the company as of the date hereof for such insurance, then parent shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, provide only such coverage as shall then be available at any annual premium equal to 200% of such rate. (e) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the effective time) is made against any indemnified party, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the effective time, the provisions of this section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. (f) this covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the indemnified parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives. the indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an indemnified party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. (g) in the event that the surviving corporation or parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) 8 35 transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the surviving corporation or parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this section 6.7. section 6.8 further action; reasonable best efforts.
