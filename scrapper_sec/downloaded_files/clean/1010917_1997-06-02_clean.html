respect to such laws. the name, citizenship, business address and present principal occupation (including the name and address of the corporation or organization in which such employment is conducted) of each executive officer and director is set forth in schedule a to this schedule 13d and is specifically incorporated herein by reference. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration this statement relates to an option granted to j&j by the issuer to purchase shares of common stock from the issuer as described in item 4 below (the "option"). the option entitles j&j to purchase 1,970,511 shares (the "option shares") under the circumstances specified in the stock option agreement dated as of may 21, 1997, between j&j and the issuer (the "stock option agreement") and as described in item 4 below, for a purchase price of $27.55 per share (the "purchase price"). the number of option shares will be adjusted if necessary so that the number of shares purchasable by j&j upon exercise of the option at the time of its exercise is equal to 19.9% of the total outstanding shares immediately prior to the time of such exercise. reference is hereby made to the stock option agreement, which is included as exhibit 10.1 to this schedule 13d, for the full text of its terms, including the conditions upon which it may be exercised. the stock option agreement is incorporated

officers of issuer will become the officers of the surviving corporation until their respective successors have been duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. j&j has the right to cause the issuer to prepare and file up to three registration statements under the securities act of 1933, as amended, in order to permit the sale by j&j of any option shares purchased under the option. in the event the merger is consummated, the common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market and will be converted into shares of j&j common stock, which at the effective time of the merger will be listed on the new york stock exchange. the descriptions herein of the merger agreement and the stock option agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, copies of which are filed as exhibits 2.1 and 10.1, respectively, to this schedule 13d and which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. other than as described

respect to such shares if the option were exercised. the option shares described herein are subject to the option, which is not currently exercisable. nothing herein shall be deemed to be an admission by j&j as to the beneficial ownership of any option shares, and, prior to exercise of the option, j&j expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of all option shares. except as described herein, neither j&j nor, to the best of j&j's knowledge, any other person referred to in schedule a attached hereto, beneficially owns or has acquired or disposed of any shares during the past 60 days. item 6.

(e) no fractional shares. (i) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of parent common stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of parent. (ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, each holder of shares of company common stock exchanged pursuant to the merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of parent common stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, equal to such fractional part of a share of parent common stock multiplied by the per share closing price of parent common stock on the date of the stockholders meeting, as such price is reported on the nyse composite transactions tape (as reported by the wall street journal, or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source). (f) termination of exchange fund. any portion of the exchange fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the certificates for six months after the effective time shall be delivered to parent, upon demand, and any holders of the certificates who have not theretofore complied with this article ii shall thereafter look only to parent for, and parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for parent common stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to parent common stock.

amended (the "securities act"), by the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") and may be deemed an "affiliate" of the company for purposes of qualifying the merger (as defined below) for pooling of interests accounting treatment under opinion 16 of the accounting principles board and applicable sec rules and regulations, although nothing contained herein should be construed as an admission of either such fact. pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger dated as of may 21, 1997, among johnson & johnson, a new jersey corporation ("parent"), palisades merger corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("sub"), and the company, sub will be merged with and into the company (the "merger"), and in connection with the merger, the undersigned is entitled to receive common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("parent common stock"), of parent. if in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the securities act, the undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer the parent common stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of company common stock in connection with the merger may be restricted unless such transaction is registered under the securities act or an exemption from such registration is available. the undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and the undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities of rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the securities act. the undersigned understands that parent will not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement under the securities act for the purposes of resale of

results covering at least 30 days of post-merger combined operations of the company and parent have been published by parent, in the form of a quarterly earnings report, an effective registration statement filed with the sec, a report to the sec on form 10-k, 10-q or 8-k, or any other public filing or announcement which includes such combined results of operations, except as would not

pursuant to rule 145, the undersigned will supply parent with evidence of compliance with such rule, in the form of a letter in the form of annex i hereto (or other reasonably satisfactory documentation evidencing compliance with rule 145) and the opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to above. the undersigned understands that parent may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any parent common stock disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not prohibited by any other provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of such

actions as may be reasonably available to it to permit the sale or other disposition of parent common stock by the undersigned under rule 145 in accordance with the terms thereof. the undersigned

transferee thereof, which legends will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to parent from counsel reasonably satisfactory to parent to the effect that such legends are no longer required for purposes of the securities act. there will be placed on the certificates for parent common stock issued to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: "the shares represented by this certificate were issued pursuant to a business combination which is being accounted for as a pooling of interests, in a transaction to which rule 145 promulgated under the securities act of 1933 applies. the shares have not been acquired by the holder with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the securities act of 1933. the shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred (i) until such time as johnson & johnson shall have published financial results covering at least 30 days of combined operations after the effective time and (ii) except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933." the undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the distribution,

filed by parent with the securities and exchange commission, the securities sold by the undersigned were within the prescribed limitations set forth in paragraph (e) of rule 144 promulgated under the

agreement exhibit 10.1 execution copy stock option agreement dated as of may 21, 1997 (the "agreement"), by and between biopsys medical, inc., a delaware corporation ("issuer"), and johnson & johnson, a new jersey corporation ("grantee"). recitals a. issuer, grantee and palisades merger corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of grantee ("sub"), have entered into an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "merger agreement"; defined terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the merger agreement), providing for, among other things, the merger of sub with and into issuer, with issuer becoming the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of grantee; and b. as a condition and inducement to grantee's willingness to enter into the merger agreement, grantee has requested that issuer agree, and issuer has agreed, to grant grantee the option (as defined below); now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, issuer and grantee agree as follows: 1. grant of option. subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, issuer hereby grants to grantee an irrevocable option (the "option") to purchase up to 1,970,511 (as adjusted as set forth herein) shares (the "option shares") (provided that the amount of the option shares shall upon timely issuance be adjusted to equal 19.9% of the then issued and outstanding shares) of common stock, par value $.001 per share ("issuer common stock"), of issuer at a purchase price of the per share price (as adjusted as set forth herein) per option share (the "purchase price"); provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if grantee receives in the aggregate an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the proceeds (net of any commissions or similar costs) received by grantee in connection with any sales or other dispositions of option shares and any dividends received by grantee on option shares over (ii) the sum of (x) the product of the purchase price times the number of option shares acquired by grantee pursuant to the option and (y) $9 million, then an amount equal to such excess shall be promptly paid by grantee to issuer. 2. exercise of option. (a) grantee may exercise the option, with respect to all (but not less than all) of the option shares at any one time, subject to the provisions of section 2(c), after the occurrence of any event as a result of which the grantee is entitled to receive the termination fee pursuant to section 5.08(b) of the merger agreement (a "purchase event"); provided, however, that (i) except as provided in the last sentence of this section 2(a), the option will terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of (a) the effective time, (b) 12 months after the first occurrence of a purchase event and (c) termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the occurrence of a purchase event, unless, in the case of clause (c), grantee has or may have the right to receive a termination fee following such termination upon the occurrence of certain events, in which case the option will not terminate until the later of (x) six months following the time such termination fee becomes payable and (y) the expiration of the period in which the grantee has or may have such right to receive a termination fee, and (ii) any purchase of option shares upon exercise of the option will be subject to compliance with the hsr act and the obtaining or making of any consents, approvals, orders, notifications or authorizations, the failure of which to have obtained or made would have the effect of making the issuance of option shares illegal (the "regulatory approvals"). (b) in the event that grantee wishes to exercise the option, it will send to issuer a written notice (an "exercise notice"; the date of which being herein referred to as the "notice date") to that effect which exercise notice also specifies the number of option shares, if any, grantee wishes to purchase pursuant to this section 2(b), the number of option shares, if any, with respect to which grantee wishes to exercise its cash-out right (as defined herein) pursuant to section 6(c), the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing the option shares which grantee wishes to purchase pursuant to this section 2(b) and a date not earlier than three business days nor later than 20 business days from the notice date for the closing of such purchase (an "option closing date"). any option closing will be at an agreed location and time in new york, new york on the applicable option closing date or at such later date as may be necessary so as to comply with clause (ii) of section 2(a). (c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any exercise of the option and purchase of option shares shall be subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which may prohibit the purchase of all the option shares specified in the exercise notice without first obtaining or making certain regulatory approvals. in such event, if the option is otherwise exercisable and grantee wishes to exercise the option, the option may be exercised in accordance with section 2(b) and grantee shall acquire the maximum number of option shares specified in the exercise notice that grantee is then permitted to acquire under the applicable laws and regulations, and if grantee thereafter obtains the regulatory approvals to acquire the remaining balance of the option shares specified in the exercise notice, then grantee shall be entitled to acquire such remaining balance. issuer agrees to use its reasonable efforts to assist grantee in seeking the regulatory approvals. in the event (i) grantee receives official notice that a regulatory approval required for the purchase of any option shares will not be issued or granted or (ii) such regulatory approval has not been issued or granted within six months of the date of the exercise notice, grantee shall have the right to exercise its cash-out right pursuant to section 6(c) with respect to the option shares for which such regulatory approval will not be issued or granted or has not been issued or granted. 3. payment and delivery of certificates. (a) at any option closing, grantee will pay to issuer in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by issuer an amount equal to the purchase price multiplied by the number of option shares to be purchased at such option closing. (b) at any option closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in section 3(a), issuer will deliver to grantee a certificate or certificates representing the option shares to be purchased at such option closing, which option shares will be free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever. if at the time of issuance of option shares pursuant to an exercise of the option hereunder, issuer shall not have redeemed the rights, or shall have issued any similar securities, then each option share issued pursuant to such exercise will also represent a corresponding right or new rights with terms substantially the same as and at least as favorable to grantee as are provided under the rights agreement or any similar agreement then in effect. (c) certificates for the option shares delivered at an option closing will have typed or printed thereon a restrictive legend which will read substantially as follows: "the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and may be reoffered or sold only if so registered or if an exemption from such registration is available. such securities are also subject to additional restrictions on transfer as set forth in the stock option agreement, dated as of may 21, 1997, a copy of which may be obtained from the secretary of biopsys medical, inc. at its principal executive offices." it is understood and agreed that (i) the reference to restrictions arising under the securities act in the above legend will be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if such option shares have been registered pursuant to the securities act, such option shares have been sold in reliance on and in accordance with rule 144 under the securities act or grantee has delivered to issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the sec, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to issuer and its counsel, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act and (ii) the reference to restrictions pursuant to this agreement in the above legend will be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the option shares evidenced by certificate(s) containing such reference have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference. 4. representations and warranties of issuer. issuer hereby represents and warrants to grantee as follows: (a) authorized stock. issuer has taken all necessary corporate and other action to authorize and reserve and, subject to the expiration or termination of any required waiting period under the hsr act, to permit it to issue, and, at all times from the date hereof until the obligation to deliver option shares upon the exercise of the option terminates, shall have reserved for issuance, upon exercise of the option, shares of issuer common stock necessary for grantee to exercise the option, and issuer will take all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve for issuance all additional shares of issuer common stock or other securities which may be issued pursuant to section 6 upon exercise of the option. the shares of issuer common stock to be issued upon due exercise of the option, including all additional shares of issuer common stock or other securities which may be issuable upon exercise of the option or any other securities which may be issued pursuant to section 6, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever, including without limitation any preemptive rights of any stockholder of issuer. 5. representations and warranties of grantee. grantee hereby represents and warrants to issuer that: (a) purchase not for distribution. any option shares or other securities acquired by grantee upon exercise of the option will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in a transaction registered, or exempt from registration, under the securities act. 6. adjustment upon changes in capitalization, etc. (a) in the event of any change in issuer common stock by reason of a stock dividend, split-up, merger, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, or similar transaction, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the option, and the purchase price thereof, will be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision will be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that grantee will receive upon exercise of the option the number and class of shares or other securities or property that grantee would have received in respect of issuer common stock if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, as applicable. (b) without limiting the parties' relative rights and obligations under the merger agreement, if prior to or concurrently with the termination of the option issuer enters into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, and issuer will not be the continuing or surviving corporation in such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into issuer and issuer will be the continuing or surviving corporation, but in connection with such merger, the shares of issuer common stock outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such merger will be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of issuer or any other person or cash or any other property, or the shares of issuer common stock outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such merger will, after such merger, represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction will make proper provision so that the option will, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option with identical terms appropriately adjusted to acquire the number and class of shares or other securities or property that grantee would have received in respect of issuer common stock if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale, or transfer, or the record date therefor, as applicable and make any other necessary adjustments. (c) if, at any time during the period commencing on a purchase event and ending on the termination of the option in accordance with section 2, grantee sends to issuer an exercise notice indicating grantee's election to exercise its right (the "cash-out right") pursuant to this section 6(c), then issuer shall pay to grantee, on the option closing date, in exchange for the cancelation of the option with respect to such number of option shares as grantee specifies in the exercise notice, an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (1) $9 million and (2) such number of option shares multiplied by the difference between (i) the average closing price per share during the 20 nms trading days commencing on the 22nd nms trading day immediately preceding the notice date, of issuer common stock as quoted on the nms (or, if not traded on the nms, as reported on any other national securities exchange or national securities quotation system on which the issuer common stock is listed or quoted, as reported in the wall street journal, or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) and (ii) the purchase price. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the sum of (a) the amount equal to the difference of clause (i) and clause (ii)(x) of section 1 with respect to any transfer by grantee of the option shares which were not cashed out pursuant to this section 6(c) and (b) the amount received by grantee pursuant to the cash-out right shall not exceed $9 million, and grantee shall pay promptly any such excess above $9 million to issuer. 7. registration rights. issuer will, if requested by grantee at any time and from time to time within three years of the exercise of the option, as expeditiously as possible prepare and file up to three registration statements under the securities act if such registration is necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any or all shares of securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to grantee upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition stated by grantee, including a "shelf" registration statement under rule 415 under the securities act or any successor provision, and issuer will use its reasonable efforts to qualify such shares or other securities under any applicable state securities laws. grantee agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause, and to cause any underwriters of any sale or other disposition to cause, any sale or other disposition pursuant to such registration statement or otherwise to be effected on a widely distributed basis so that upon consummation thereof no purchaser or transferee will own beneficially more than 4.9% of the then-outstanding voting power of issuer. issuer will use reasonable efforts to cause each such registration statement to become effective, to obtain all consents or waivers of other parties which are required therefor, and to keep such registration statement effective for such period not in excess of 180 calendar days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sale or other disposition. the obligations of issuer hereunder to file a registration statement and to maintain its effectiveness may be suspended for up to 60 calendar days in the aggregate if the board of directors of issuer shall have determined that the filing of such registration statement or the maintenance of its effectiveness would require premature disclosure of material nonpublic information that would materially and adversely affect issuer or otherwise interfere with or adversely affect any pending or proposed offering of securities of issuer or any other material transaction involving issuer. any registration statement prepared and filed under this section 7, and any sale covered thereby, will be at issuer's expense except for underwriting discounts or commissions, brokers' fees and the fees and disbursements of grantee's counsel related thereto. grantee will provide all information reasonably requested by issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. if, during the time periods referred to in the first sentence of this section 7, issuer effects an underwritten registration under the securities act of issuer common stock for its own account or for any other stockholders of issuer (other than on form s-4 or form s-8, or any successor form), it will allow grantee the right to participate in such registration, and such participation will not affect the obligation of issuer to effect demand registration statements for grantee under this section 7; provided that, if the managing underwriters of such offering advise issuer in writing that in their opinion the number of shares of issuer common stock requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering at a price acceptable to issuer's board of directors, issuer will first reduce the shares requested to be included therein by grantee before reducing any other shares intended to be included therein. in connection with any registration pursuant to this section 7, issuer and grantee will provide each other and any underwriter of the offering with customary representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification, and contribution in connection with such registration. 8. transfers. the option shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of except (i) in an underwritten public offering as provided in section 7 or (ii) to any purchaser or transferee who would not, to the knowledge of the grantee after reasonable inquiry, immediately following such sale, assignment, transfer or disposal beneficially own more than 4.9% of the then-outstanding voting power of the issuer; provided, however, that grantee shall be permitted to sell any option shares if such sale is made pursuant to a tender or exchange offer that has been approved or recommended by a majority of the members of the board of directors of issuer (which majority shall include a majority of directors who were directors as of the date hereof). the option may not be sold, assigned, transfered or otherwise disposed of by grantee, and any sale, assignment, transfer or disposal shall be null and void. 9. listing. if issuer common stock or any other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option are then traded on the nms (or any other national securities exchange or national securities quotation system), issuer, upon the request of grantee, will promptly file an application to have the shares of issuer common stock or other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option approved for trading on the nms (and any such other national securities exchange or national securities quotation system) and will use reasonable efforts to obtain approval of such application as promptly as practicable. 10. loss or mutilation. upon receipt by issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancelation of this agreement, if mutilated, issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date. 11. miscellaneous. (a) expenses. except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each of the parties hereto will bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants, and counsel. (b) amendment. this agreement may not be amended, except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. (c) extension; waiver. any agreement on the part of a party to waive any provision of this agreement, or to extend the time for performance, will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. the failure of any party to this agreement to assert any of its rights under this agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. (d) entire agreement; no third-party beneficiaries. this agreement, the stockholder agreement, the merger agreement (including the documents and instruments attached thereto as exhibits or schedules or delivered in connection therewith) and the confidentiality agreement (including the predecessor secrecy agreement dated july 17, 1996 between the company and a subsidiary of parent) (i) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this agreement, the stockholder agreement, the merger agreement and the confidentiality agreement, and (ii) except as provided in section 8.06 of the merger agreement, are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or remedies. (e) governing law. this agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws thereof. (f) notices. all notices, requests, claims, demands, and other communications under this agreement must be in writing and will be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied (which is confirmed), or sent by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice): if to issuer to: biopsys medical, inc. 3 morgan irvine, ca 92618 attention: steven l. gex fax: (714) 460-7811 with copies to: wilson sonsini goodrich & rosati 650 page mill road palo alto, ca 94304 attention: casey mcglynn, esq. christopher d. mitchell, esq. marty korman, esq. fax: (415) 496-6811 if to grantee to: johnson & johnson one johnson & johnson plaza new brunswick, nj 08933 attention: michael h. ullmann fax: (908) 524-2788 with a copy to: cravath, swaine & moore worldwide plaza 825 eighth avenue new york, new york 10019 attention: robert i. townsend, iii, esq. fax: (212) 474-3700 (g) assignment. neither this agreement, the option nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations under this agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by issuer or grantee without the prior written consent of the other. any assignment or delegation in violation of the preceding sentence will be void. subject to the first and second sentences of this section 11(g), this agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. (h) further assurances. in the event of any exercise of the option by grantee, issuer and grantee will execute and deliver all other documents and instruments and take all other actions that may be reasonably necessary in order to consummate the transactions provided for by such exercise.
