such interest to the highest lawful rate, and if from any such circumstance the any holder should ever receive anything of value deemed interest by applicable law which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount then outstanding hereunder or on account of any other then outstanding obligations and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the principal unpaid balance then outstanding hereunder and such other then outstanding obligations, such excess shall be refunded to the issuers. all sums paid or agreed to be paid to any holder for the use, forbearance, or detention of the obligations and other indebtedness of the issuers to the holders, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness, until payment in full thereof, so that the actual rate of interest on account of all such indebtedness does not exceed the highest lawful rate throughout the entire term of such indebtedness. the terms and provisions of this section 9.14 ------------ shall control every other provision of this

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- common stock purchase warrants warrant agreement dated as of april 11, 1997, between uti energy corp., a delaware corporation (the "company") and those persons signatory hereto (collectively, the "warrant holders" or "holders"). the company proposes to issue common stock purchase warrants as hereinafter described (collectively the "warrants") to purchase an aggregate of up to 400,000 shares of its common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the shares of common stock issuable on exercise of the warrants being referred to herein as the "warrant shares"), in favor of the warrant holder. capitalized terms used herein, if not otherwise defined, are defined in section 8 hereof. the company and the warrant holder hereby agree as follows: section 1. transferability; notice of corporate actions; form of the warrants. 1.1 registration. the warrants shall be numbered and shall be registered on the books of the company maintained at the principal executive offices of the company ("the warrant register"). the company shall be entitled to treat the holder of the warrants, as reflected in the warrant

duly authenticated evidence of their authority shall be produced, and may be required to be deposited and to remain with the company in its discretion. upon any registration of transfer, the company shall countersign and deliver new warrants to the persons entitled thereto. the company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such transfer. 1.4 notices of corporate actions. nothing contained in this warrant agreement shall be construed as conferring upon the holder of warrants, (as opposed to the holder of warrant shares), the right to vote or to receive dividends or other distributions or to 1 consent to or receive notice as a stockholder in respect of any meeting of stockholders for the election of directors or any other matter, or any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the company. however, in the event of: (a) any taking by the company of a record of the holders of the common stock for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any extraordinary dividend or distribution, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of any class or any other securities or (b) any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the company, the company shall mail to each warrant holder in accordance with the provisions of section 13 hereof a notice specifying (i) the date or expected date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right and (ii) the date or expected date on which any such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take place, the time, if any such time is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for the securities or other property deliverable upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up and a description in reasonable detail of the transaction. such notice shall be mailed to the extent practicable at least ten (10) days (and at least thirty (30) days if the transfer books for the warrant shares or other class of stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants shall be closed on the date that notice is given), but not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date therein specified. in the event that the company at any time sends any notice to the holders of its common stock, it shall concurrently send a copy of such notice to each warrant holder. 1.5 form of the warrants. the text of the warrants and of the form of election to purchase warrant shares (the "purchase form") shall be substantially as set forth respectively in exhibits a and b attached hereto. the price per warrant share (the "warrant price") and the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of each warrant are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, all as hereinafter provided. the warrants shall be executed on behalf of the company by its chairman of the board, its chief executive officer, president or one of its vice presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon, and attested by its secretary or an assistant secretary. the warrants shall be dated as of the date of countersignature thereof by the company either upon initial issuance or upon transfer. 1.6 restrictive legend. except as otherwise provided in this section 1.6, each warrant and each certificate for warrants or warrant shares and each certificate for warrant shares issued to any subsequent transferee of any such certificate, shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form: 2 the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), or any state securities law. no transfer of the securities represented by this certificate shall be valid or effective unless (a) such transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the act or (b) the holder of the securities proposed to be transferred shall have delivered to the company an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the company to the effect that such proposed transfer is exempt from the regis tration requirements of the act and that the exercise of the warrants and purchase of the warrant shares will be exempt from the registration requirements of the act and such holder(s) shall have delivered to the company a certificate setting forth the basis for applying such rule to the proposed transfer. 1.7 termination of securities laws restrictions. the legend require ments of section 1.6 shall terminate as to any particular warrant or warrant shares when the company shall have received from the holder thereof an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the company to the effect that such legend is not required in order to ensure compliance with the

(iii) combine its shares of common stock outstanding into a smaller number of shares of such common stock, then the exercise price shall be adjusted to equal the product of the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which is equal to the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such adjustment. 6.2. rights offerings of common stock. (a) in case the company shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share (determined as provided below) of the common stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants, the exercise price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be decreased by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such current market price and the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such decrease to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. to the extent that shares of common stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the exercise price shall be readjusted (but only with regard to the warrants exercised after such expiration) to the exercise price that would be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made upon the basis of delivery of only the 6 number of shares of common stock actually issued. for the purposes of this provision, the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company but shall include shares issuable in respect of script certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of common stock. the company will not issue any rights, options or warrants in respect of shares of common stock held in the treasury of the company. the foregoing provisions of this section 6.2 shall not apply to any rights issued to holders of the company's common stock that are not currently exercisable and shall not apply until such time that such rights become exercisable. (b) the provisions of this section 6.2 shall not apply to any issuance of common stock for which an adjustment is provided for under section 6.1. 6.3. other distributions. in case the company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its common stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of any class of capital stock, or other property (including securities, but excluding (i) any rights, options or warrants referred to in section 6.2, (ii) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, (iii) any dividend or distribution referred to in section 6.1, and (iv) any merger or consolidation or other transactions to which section 6.5 applies), the exercise price shall be reduced by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price per share of the common stock on the date fixed for such determination (the "reference date") less the then fair market value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors whose determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) on the reference date of the portion assets, shares or evidences of indebtedness of the company so distributed applicable to one share of common stock and the denominator shall be the current market price per share of the common stock on the reference date, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the reference date; provided however, that if such dividend or distribution is ultimately not paid, the exercise price shall be retroactively readjusted as provided in section 6.4 6.4. adjustment of number of shares purchasable. upon any adjustment of the exercise price as provided in section 6 hereof, the warrant holder shall thereafter be entitled to purchase upon the exercise of the warrants, at the exercise price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares of common stock (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) obtained by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares of common stock issuable on the exercise hereof immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by the exercise price resulting from such adjustment. 6.5. reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets in case the company shall reorganize its capital, reclassify its capital stock, consolidate or merge with or into another corporation (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is any change whatsoever in, or distribution with respect to, the outstanding common stock of the company), or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of 7 all or substantially all of its property, assets or business to another corporation and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets, (i) shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the company (if it is the surviving corporation) or (ii) any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation ("other property") are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock of the company who are holders immediately prior to such transaction, then the warrant holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of the warrants, the number of shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the company, if it is the surviving corporation, and other property receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets by a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which the warrants are exercisable immediately prior to such event. in such event, the aggregate exercise price otherwise payable for the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants shall be allocated among the shares of common stock and other property receivable as a result of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets in proportion to the respective fair market values of such shares of common stock and other property as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. in case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets, the successor or acquiring corporation (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this agreement to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be reasonably deemed appropriate (as determined by resolution of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of any shares of the common stock of such successor or acquiring corporation for which the warrants thus become exercisable, which modifications shall be as equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 6. for purposes of this section 6.5, "common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation" shall include stock of such corporation of any class that is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation and that is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock

as follows: 8 (1) securities or other property. in the case of securities or other property, the fair market value thereof as of the date immediately preceding such issuance, sale, grant or exercise as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (2) dividends in securities in case the company shall declare a dividend or make any other distribution upon any stock of the company payable in either case in common stock or convertible securities, such common stock or convertible securities, as the case may be, issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been issued or sold without consideration. (3) merger, consolidation or sale of assets. in case any shares of common stock, stock purchase rights or convertible securities shall be issued in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the company is the surviving corporation, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the assets and business of the non- surviving corporation attributable to such common stock, stock purchase rights or convertible securities, as is determined in good faith by the company's board of directors which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 6.7. other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the adjustments provided for pursuant to this section 6: (a) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 6 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring such an adjust ment shall occur. for the purpose of any such adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence.

(d) maximum exercise price. except as provided in section 6.1 above, at no time shall the exercise price per share of common stock exceed the amount set forth in this agreement. 9 (e) certain limitations. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the company agrees not to enter into any transaction that, by reason of any adjustment under section 6 above, would cause the exercise price to be less than the par value of the common stock, if any, unless the company first reduces the par value of the common stock to be less than the exercise price that would result from such transaction. (f) notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of common stock for which the warrants are exercisable or the exercise price shall be adjusted pursuant to this section 6, the company shall forthwith prepare a certificate to be executed by the chief financial officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated, specifying the number of shares of common stock for which the warrants are exercisable and (if such adjustment was made pursuant to section 6.3) describing the number and kind of any other shares of stock or other property for which the warrants are exercisable, and any related change in the exercise price, after giving effect to such adjustment or change. the company shall within a reasonable amount of time cause a signed copy of such certificate to be delivered to each holder in accordance with section 13. the company shall keep at its principal office copies of all such certificates and cause the same to be available for inspection at said office during normal business hours by any holder or any prospective transferee of any warrants designated by a holder thereof. 6.8 disputes. in the event that there is any dispute as to the computation of the price or the number of warrant shares required to be issued upon exercise of warrants or any other disputed calculation or adjustment under section 6 hereof, the warrant holders and the company will retain an independent and nationally recognized accounting firm to conduct at the expense of the company a special procedures engagement of the computations pursuant to the terms hereof involved in such dispute, including the financial statements or other information upon which such computations were based. the determination of such nationally recognized accounting firm shall, in the absence of manifest error, be binding upon the warrant holders and the company. if there shall be a dispute as to the selection of such nationally recognized accounting firm, such firm shall be appointed by the american institute of certified public accountants, if willing, otherwise the american arbitration association, upon application by the company or any holder or holders of at least 25% of the outstanding warrants with notice to the others. section 7. registration.

(c) remy piggyback registration. if at any time the company shall --------------------------- contemplate filing a registration statement under the act in order to register any shares of the company's common stock beneficially owned by remy capital partners iii l.p. or its successors or assigns or any transferees of remy (collectively, "remy") for sale in a public offering, the company shall give to the holder not less than thirty days prior written notice of its intentions, which notice shall specify the number of shares of common stock to be registered pursuant to the contemplated registration statement and the total number of such shares of common stock beneficially owned by remy to be registered pursuant to the contemplated registration statement (the "remy shares"). the holders shall have the right, exercisable by written notice delivered to the company not later than the fifteenth day following the date of the company's notice, to cause the company to include in such registration statement up to a number of warrant shares (disregarding fractional shares) determined by multiplying (x) the total number of warrant shares then owned of record by the holder, and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of remy shares and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock then held of record by remy. in the alternative, the holder may specify any lesser whole number of warrant shares then owned of record by the holder. the number of the holder's warrant shares so properly specified is herein referred to as the "piggyback shares". the company shall include the piggyback shares in any registration statement filed by it which includes the remy shares, and shall thereafter use its reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and to remain effective for the period required to permit the public offering of the piggyback shares, but not longer than 60 days. however, if all or any part of the proposed registration is to be underwritten (whether on a "best efforts" or "firm commitment" basis) the managing underwriter shall have the right to exclude the piggyback shares, to the extent the inclusion of such piggyback shares and remy shares would, in the written opinion of such managing underwriter, adversely affect the successful distribution of the underwritten portion of the public offering, provided such exclusion applies on a proportional basis not only to piggyback shares but also to all other securities proposed to be included other than those to be issued and sold for the benefit of the company pursuant to such registration statement. any exclusion of piggyback shares -5- and other shares shall be made pro rata among all persons other than the company whose common stock was to have been included in the offering, including remy. (d) registration statement form. the company may, if permitted by --------------------------- law, effect any registration requested under section 2(a) by the filing of a registration statement on form s-3 (or any successor or similar short-form registration statement). (e) expenses. the company shall pay all registration expenses -------- incurred in connection with the registration of registrable securities pursuant to section 2(a), 2(b) or 2(c) hereunder. (f) effective registration statement. any registration effected by -------------------------------- the company pursuant to this agreement shall not be deemed to have been effected unless it has become effective with the commission, provided, however, that a -------- ------- registration which does not become effective after the company has filed a registration statement with respect thereto with the commission solely by reason of the demanding holders failing to proceed with the registration shall be deemed to have been effected by the company in satisfaction of one of the company's four demand obligations pursuant to section 2(a) to register registrable securities pursuant to a demand registration. notwithstanding the foregoing, a registration statement will not be deemed to have been effected if after it has become effective with the commission, such registration is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or any court proceeding for any reason other than a misrepresentation or omission by the holders. (g) conflicting instructions from holders. the company may rely and ------------------------------------- shall be protected in relying upon any resolution, certificate, opinion, request, communication, demand, receipt or other paper or document in good faith believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. the company may act in reliance upon the advice of its counsel in reference to any matter in connection with this agreement and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in accordance with such advice. (i) in the event the company receives conflicting instructions regarding any action to be taken or withheld hereunder, the company may suspend further action relating to such action until such time as the conflicting instructions are resolved by the parties giving the same or until the company is instructed to take or withhold the requested action by a final order from which no appeal may be taken issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. 3. registration procedures. ----------------------- (a) whenever the company is required to effect the registration of any registrable securities under the securities act as provided in section 2, the company, as expeditiously as reasonably practicable and subject to the terms and conditions herein, will use its best efforts to: -6- (i) prepare and file with the commission the requisite registration statement to effect such registration and use its best efforts to cause such registration to become effective; (ii) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for such time as the company is so obligated pursuant to this agreement and to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement; (iii) furnish to the selling holders such number of conformed copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus contained in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under the securities act, in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents, as the selling holders may reasonably request; (iv) as expeditiously as reasonably practicable, use its best efforts to register or qualify all registrable securities covered by such registration statement under such other united states state securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the selling holders shall reasonably request, to keep such registration statement qualification in effect for so long as such registration remains in effect, and take any other action which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the selling holders to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities owned by the selling holders, except that the company shall not for any such purpose be required to (a) qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements of this subdivision (iv) be obligated to be so qualified, (b) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (c) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; (v) in any underwritten offering, and if reasonable and customary in the context of such offering, use its best efforts to furnish to the selling holders a signed counterpart, addressed to the selling holders or seller of registrable securities (and the underwriters, if any), of (x) an opinion of counsel for the company, dated the effective date of such registration statement (and, if such registration includes an underwritten public offering, dated the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement), reasonably satisfactory to the selling holders in their reasonable judgment, and (y) if requested, a customary "comfort" letter, dated the effective date of such registration statement (and, if such registration includes an underwritten public offering, dated the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement), signed by the independent public accountants who have certified the company's financial statements included in such registration statement, covering substantially the same matters with respect to such registration statement (and the prospectus included therein) and, in the case of the accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent to the date of such financial statements, -7- as are customarily covered in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities and, in the case of the accountants' letter, such other financial matters as such seller or such holder (or the underwriters, if any) may reasonably request; (vi) immediately notify the selling holders at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and at the request of the selling holders promptly prepare and furnish to the selling holders a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; (vii) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act. (ix) use its best efforts to list all registrable securities covered by such registration statement on any securities exchange on which any of the registrable securities are then listed. (x) keep each registration pursuant to section 2(a) hereof effective for a period of up to 120 days or such shorter period of time until the transfer or sale of all warrant shares so registered has been completed. (b) as a condition of these registration rights, the company may require the demanding holders, at their own expense, to furnish the company with such information and undertakings regarding such holders and the distribution of such securities as the company may from time to time reasonably request in writing, and the holders, by their execution hereof, agree to provide such information and make such undertakings as are requested. (c) the selling holders agree (a) that upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in subdivision (vi) of section 3(a), the selling holders will forthwith discontinue their disposition of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement relating to such registrable securities until the selling holders' receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subdivision (vi) of section 3(a) and, if so directed by the company, will deliver to the company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in the selling holders' possession of the prospectus relating to such registrable securities current at the time of receipt of such notice and (b) that they will immediately notify the company, at any time when a prospectus relating to the registration of such registrable securities -8- is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event as a result of which information previously furnished by the selling holders to the company for inclusion in such prospectus contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made. (d) notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the company will not be required to file such a registration statement if it receives an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the selling holders, or counsel to the selling holders, to the effect that the sale of the registrable securities in the manner contemplated by the selling holders may be effected without registration. 4. underwritten offerings. ---------------------- (a) underwritten offerings. if requested by the underwriters for any ---------------------- underwritten offering by the selling holders in connection with any piggyback registration pursuant to section 2(c), the selling holders will enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters for such offering, containing such terms as are customarily contained in agreements of this type. the selling holders may, at their option (reasonably exercised), require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of the selling holders and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of the selling holders.

(b) to the extent permitted by applicable law, each selling holder shall indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who shall have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the -10- securities act, any other selling holder, any controlling person of any such other selling holder; each officer, director, partner, and employee of such other selling holder and such controlling person and each underwriter to the extent that such selling holder participates in an underwritten registration, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (joint and several), including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to which any of the foregoing persons may otherwise become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such selling holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided, -------- however, that (x) the indemnification required by this section 6(b) shall not - - ------- apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if settlement is effected without the consent of the relevant selling holder of registrable securities, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (y) in no event shall the amount of any indemnity under this section 6(b) exceed the gross proceeds from the applicable offering received by such selling holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may make a claim under this section 6, such indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall -------- ------- have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense except as provided below. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time following the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 6 but shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than pursuant to this section 6. any such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expenses of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to promptly assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding or (iii) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that it has reasonably determined that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party and that the assertion of such defenses would create a conflict of interest such that counsel employed by the indemnifying party could not faithfully represent the indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in -11- connection with any one such action, claim or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties. no indemnifying party shall be liable to an indemnified party for any settlement of any action, proceeding or claim without the written consent of the indemnifying party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (d) if the indemnification required by this section 6 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in this section 6: (i) the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any violation has been committed by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such violation. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 6(a) and section 6(b), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (ii) the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in section 6(d)(i). no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) if indemnification is available under this section 6, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in this section 6 without regard to the relative fault of such indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration referred to in section 6(d); provided, however, that if it is determined by a final and non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that a party receiving indemnification hereunder was not entitled to receive such indemnification, the additional cost, if any, to the indemnifying party of such indemnification shall be promptly reimbursed by such improperly indemnified party to such indemnifying party. -12- (f) the obligations of the company and the selling holders of registrable securities under this section 6 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement under this agreement, and otherwise. 7. covenants of the company. the company hereby agrees and covenants as ------------------------ follows: the company shall file as and when applicable, on a timely basis, all reports required to be filed by it under the exchange act. if the company is not required to file reports pursuant to the exchange act, upon the request of any holder of registrable securities, the company shall make publicly available the information specified in subparagraph (c)(2) of rule 144 of the securities act, and take such further action as may be reasonably required from time to time and as may be within the reasonable control of the company, to enable the holders to transfer registrable securities to a transferee without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the securities act or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. 8. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) specific performance. the parties hereto acknowledge that there -------------------- may be no adequate remedy at law if any party fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder and that each party may be irreparably harmed by any such failure, and accordingly agree that each party, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity, may be entitled to compel specific performance of the obligations of any other party under this agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement.
