therein, merger sub will commence an offer (the "offer") to exchange for each outstanding share of labtec (i) $11.00 in cash and (ii) a fraction of an american depositary share of logitech (each, a "logitech ads") equal to $7.00 divided by the average closing bid price of a logitech ads as reported by bloomberg financial markets (or such other source as labtec and logitech shall agree) on the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is three business days prior to the day on which the offer actually expires, but will not be less than 0.2234 of a logitech ads (if such average closing bid price exceeds schedule 13d page 4 of 8 $31.34) or more than 0.2730 of a logitech ads (if such average closing bid price is less than $25.64). the cash portion will be financed through a

with and into labtec, pursuant to which, at the effective time of the merger, the separate existence of merger sub will cease and labtec will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of logitech. by virtue of the merger, each holder of outstanding shares of labtec common stock will receive, in exchange for each share of common stock held by such holder, $11.00 in cash and a fraction of an american depositary share of logitech (each, a "logitech ads"). such fraction of a logitech ads shall be an amount equal to $7.00 divided by the average closing bid price of a logitech ads as reported by bloomberg financial markets (or such other source as labtec and logitech shall agree) on the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is three business days prior to the day on which the offer actually expires, but will not be less than 0.2234 of a logitech ads (if such average closing bid price exceeds $31.34) or more than 0.2730 of a logitech ads (if such average closing bid price is less than $25.64).
