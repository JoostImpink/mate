(e) closing of stock transfer books. all cash paid upon the surrender of certificates in accordance with the terms of this article ii shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of company common stock theretofore represented by such certificates. at the effective time, the stock transfer books of the company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving corporation of the shares of company common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, certificates are presented to the surviving corporation or the paying agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this article ii.

(a) option consideration. except as set forth in this section 2.03 and except to the extent that merger sub and the holder of any option otherwise agree in writing prior to or contemporaneously with the effective time, the surviving corporation shall promptly after the effective time pay in cash to each holder of an outstanding option to purchase company common stock (a "company stock option") granted pursuant to the company's 1996 stock option/stock issuance plan or the company's executive and key employee nonstatutory incentive stock option plan (collectively, the "company stock option plans"), in settlement of each such company stock option, whether or not exercisable or vested, an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price of each such company stock option, and (y) the number of shares of company common stock subject to the company stock option immediately prior to its settlement (the "option consideration") (such payment to be net of applicable withholding taxes). upon delivery of the related option consideration, the company stock option shall be canceled. the surrender of a company stock option to the 8 13 company in exchange for the option consideration shall be deemed, upon receipt of such consideration, to be a release of all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of that company stock option. (b) consents of option holders. prior to the effective time, the company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain any consents from holders of the company stock options and make any amendments to the terms of the company stock option plans or arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by section 2.01(e) and this section 2.03. (c) termination of option plans. except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by merger sub and the company, the company stock option plans shall terminate as of the effective time, and no holder of company stock options or any participant in the company stock option plans shall have any rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the company, the surviving corporation or any subsidiary thereof. (d) termination of other plans and programs. except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by merger sub and the company, all other plans, programs or arrangements providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the company or any of its subsidiaries shall terminate as of the effective time, and no participant in any such plans, programs or arrangements shall have any rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the company, the surviving corporation or any subsidiary thereof. section 2.04 shares of dissenting stockholders. (a) notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, any shares of company common stock that are issued and outstanding as of the effective time and that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised his or her appraisal rights (the "dissenting shares") under the dgcl, shall not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his or her right to dissent from the merger under the dgcl and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such dissenting shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the dgcl. if, after the effective time, any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of such holder's company common stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the effective time, the right to receive, without interest or dividends thereon, the consideration provided for in this article ii. (b) the company shall give merger sub and the investor group (i) prompt notice of any notices or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of company common stock received by the company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. the company shall not, without prior written consent of merger sub and the investor group, make any payments 9 14 with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, with respect to any such demands. (c) dissenting shares, if any, after payments of fair value in respect thereto have been made to the holders thereof pursuant to the dgcl, shall be canceled. section 2.05 adjustment of merger consideration. in the event that, subsequent to the date of this agreement but prior to the effective time, the outstanding shares of company common stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares of a different class as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, exchange, recapitalization or other similar transaction, the merger consideration shall be appropriately adjusted. the merger consideration and the option consideration, each payable pursuant to article ii, have been calculated based upon the representations and warranties made by the company in section 3.03. in the event that, at the effective time, the actual number of shares of company common stock outstanding and/or the actual number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options, warrants or similar agreements or upon conversion of securities (including without limitation, as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of company common stock, or a recapitalization) is more than as described in section 3.03, the merger consideration and the option consideration shall be appropriately adjusted downward. article iii representations and warranties of the company except as disclosed in a separate disclosure schedule referring to the sections contained in this agreement, which has been delivered by the company to merger sub prior to the execution of this agreement (the "company disclosure schedule"), the company hereby represents and warrants to merger sub that: section 3.01 organization and qualification; subsidiaries.

(b) except as set forth in section 3.01 of the company disclosure statement, the company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other business association or entity. all outstanding
