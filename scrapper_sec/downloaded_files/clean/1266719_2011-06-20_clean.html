obtaining the company stockholder approval, the special committee, which shall have full, sole, and exclusive authority to make such decision determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the discharge or exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, may recommend an adverse recommendation change to the company board, which, upon receiving such recommendation from the special committee, may effect an adverse recommendation change in accordance with this section&#160;5.4(c). the company board shall not be entitled to effect an adverse recommendation change or terminate this agreement as permitted under section 7.1(c)(ii) unless (i) the company has

after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make an adverse recommendation change or to terminate this agreement, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the discharge or exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.&#160;&#160;in the event that the basis of such proposed action by the company is in connection with a superior proposal, the notice of recommendation change shall include the terms and conditions of such superior proposal (including the identity of the third party making the superior proposal and any financing materials related thereto, if any); (ii) during the three business day period following receipt by parent and merger sub of the notice of recommendation change, the company shall, and shall cause its representatives to, negotiate with parent and merger sub in good faith (to the extent parent and merger sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this agreement and the financing documents so that such superior proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal; and (iii) following the end of the three business day period, the company board and the special committee shall have determined in good faith after consultation with their outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this agreement and the financing documents proposed in writing by parent and merger sub in response to the notice of recommendation change or otherwise, that the superior proposal giving rise to the notice of recommendation change continues to constitute a superior proposal. any material amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such superior proposal shall require a new notice of recommendation change and the company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this section 5.4(c). &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of knowledge thereof) shall notify parent in writing of (i)&#160;any acquisition proposal, (ii)&#160;any request for non-public information relating to the company or its subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to an acquisition proposal, and (iii)&#160;any inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding an acquisition proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making any such acquisition proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms of any such acquisition proposal, inquiry or request; provided, in each case, that such acquisition proposal, request or inquiry is received by the special committee, its agents or its advisors. the company shall (x) keep parent informed in all material respects of the status and details (including material amendments to the terms thereof) of such acquisition proposal, inquiry or request and (y) provide to parent as soon as practicable after receipt thereof copies of all material written correspondence relating to such acquisition proposal or request exchanged between the company or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the person making such acquisition proposal or request, on the other hand, concerning the material terms and conditions thereof; provided that this obligation shall be excused if and to the extent that the special committee, its agents and its advisors shall be unaware of such information and documents. &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; (e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;nothing set forth in this agreement shall prevent the company board, after consultation with the special committee, or the special committee, after providing prior notice to the company board, from (i)&#160;taking and disclosing to the company&#8217;s stockholders a position contemplated by rule&#160;14e-2(a), rule 14d-9 or item 1012(a) of regulation m-a promulgated under the exchange act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), or from (ii)&#160;making any required disclosure to the company&#8217;s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the company board or special committee, as applicable, after consultation with their respective outside counsels, failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the company board&#8217;s or special committee&#8217;s, as applicable, fiduciary duties or violate their respective obligations under applicable law and none of such actions or communications shall constitute an adverse recommendation change. &#160; section 5.5&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; preparation of proxy statement and

the sec for any amendment to either the proxy statement or the schedule 13e or for additional information with respect to either the proxy statement or the schedule 13e and provide parent with copies of all correspondence between the company and the sec with respect to the proxy statement and schedule 13e.&#160;&#160;prior to filing or mailing (as applicable) the proxy statement and schedule 13e

judgment of the company board, acting upon the recommendation of the special committee (after consultation with their respective legal counsels), a failure to effect such delay, postponement, or cancellation would be inconsistent with the discharge or exercise of their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law. &#160; section 5.6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; access to information; confidentiality . &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;from the date hereof to the effective time or the earlier termination of this agreement,

contained in this section 5.14 or otherwise shall require the company to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to any debt financing prior to the effective time.&#160;&#160;all material, non-public information regarding the company and its subsidiaries provided to holdco, parent, merger sub or their respective representatives pursuant to this section 5.14 shall be kept confidential by them in accordance with the confidentiality agreement. &#160; 36 &#160; &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;holdco and parent shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to complete the debt financing and the abax equity financing at closing on the terms and conditions described in the financing documents and shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the financing documents without the prior written consent of both the special committee and the company board if such amendments, modifications or waivers would or would reasonably be expected to (i)&#160;reduce the aggregate amount of the debt financing and the abax equity financing below the amount required to consummate the merger, (ii)&#160;impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the debt financing or the abax equity financing, (iii)&#160;prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement or (iv)&#160;adversely impact the ability of holdco, parent or merger sub to enforce their respective rights against the other parties to the financing documents; provided that, the foregoing notwithstanding, holdco may amend the subordinated financing agreement to add lenders or similar entities who had not executed the subordinated financing agreement as of the date of this agreement (each on a non-exclusive basis until the closing date and so long as any such amendment does not result in a release, or reduction, of any of the funding commitments of the lenders party to the subordinated financing agreement as in effect on the date hereof).&#160;&#160;in connection with the foregoing, parent hereby represents and warrants that all material documentation required to be delivered to the bank lender, abax emerald ltd. or the abax funds in order to satisfy the conditions to funding set forth in the financing documents to which each is party have been agreed as to form with the bank lender, abax emerald ltd. or the abax funds, as the case may be.&#160;&#160;in addition, holdco and parent shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to (a)&#160;negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the abax equity financing on the terms and conditions contained in the abax commitment letter, or on other terms reasonably acceptable to parent and holdco and not in violation of this section 5.14, and (b) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the debt financing (x)&#160;in the case of the cdb debt financing, set forth in the senior financing agreement, and (y) in the case of the abax debt financing, set forth in the subordinated financing agreement.&#160;&#160;in the event that all conditions to funding under the financing documents (other than, with respect to the debt financing, the availability of equity financing) have been satisfied, holdco and parent shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and other persons to fund the debt financing and abax equity financing required to consummate the merger and related transactions on the closing date (including taking enforcement actions to cause such lenders and other persons to provide such financing).&#160;&#160;in the event any portion of the debt financing or the abax equity financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the financing documents, (1) parent shall promptly notify the company, and (2) holdco and parent shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms not materially less beneficial to holdco, parent and merger sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of holdco and/or parent, as applicable), in an amount sufficient to consummate the merger as promptly as possible, but in any event no later than the earlier of (1) 30 days after the originally contemplated closing date, or (2) the termination date.&#160;&#160;except as provided elsewhere in this section 5.14, nothing contained in this agreement shall prohibit holdco, parent or merger sub from entering into agreements relating to the debt financing, the abax equity financing or the operation of holdco, parent, merger sub or, as of the effective time, the surviving corporation, including adding other equity providers or operating partners (so long as any such agreements or entering into such agreements would not reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the closing). &#160; 37 &#160; &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;holdco and parent shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the contribution agreement immediately prior to the closing on the terms and conditions described in the contribution agreement and shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the contribution agreement that would reasonably be expected to (in the special committee&#8217;s good faith judgment) prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. &#160; section 5.15&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; delisting .&#160;&#160;parent shall cause the company&#8217;s securities to be

to be references to &#8220;more than 50%&#8221;); &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;this agreement is terminated by the company pursuant to section&#160;7.1(c)(ii); or &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;this agreement is terminated by parent pursuant to section&#160;7.1(d)(ii) &#160; then, in any such case, the company shall pay parent a termination fee of $22,500,000 (the &#8220; company termination fee &#8221;), it being understood that in no event shall the company be required to pay the company termination fee on more than one occasion. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the company terminates this agreement pursuant to sect ion &#8206;7.1(c)(i), and at the time of such termination, there is no state of facts or circumstances (other than such state of facts or circumstances as gave rise to the company&#8217;s right to terminate this agreement pursuant to section 7.1(c)(i)) that would caus e the conditions in sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 not to be satisfied on or prior to the termination date, or pursuant to section 7.1(c)(iii), then parent shall pay a termination fee to the company in an amount equal to $30,000,000 (the &#8220; parent termination fee &#8221; ), it being understood that in no event shall parent be required to pay the parent termination fee on more than one occasion.&#160;&#160;the parties agree that the payment of the parent termination fee shall constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the company with respect to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable and, upon payment of the parent termination fee, that parent (and its subsidiaries, including merger sub, and their representatives) shall have no further liability to the company (or its subsidiaries or representatives) hereunder. &#160; 43 &#160; &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;payment of the company termination fee or parent termination fee, if applicable, shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by parent or the company, as applicable by (a) the company (i)&#160;on the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to or consummation of, any transaction contemplated by an acquisition proposal, as applicable, in the case of a company termination fee payable pursuant to section&#160;7.3(b)(i), or (ii)&#160;as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five business days) after termination, in the case of termination by the company pursuant to section&#160;7.1(c)(ii) or by parent pursuant to section&#160;7.1(d)(ii), or (b) parent, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five business days) after termination, in the case of termination by the company pursuant to section 7.1(c)(i) or section 7.1(c)(iii). &#160; (e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;each of the company and parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this section&#160;7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this agreement, the damages resulting from termination of this agreement under circumstances where a company termination fee or parent termination fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and, therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to sections 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate parent or the company, as applicable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this agreement and in reliance on this agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, the company, parent and merger sub would not enter into this agreement; accordingly, if the company or parent, as applicable, fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to this section&#160;7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, parent or the company commences a suit that results in a judgment against the company or parent, as the case may be, for the amounts set forth in this section&#160;7.3, the company or parent, as applicable, shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this section&#160;7.3 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in the wall street journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. &#160; section 7.4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; amendment or supplement .&#160;&#160;this agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the effective time, whether before or after

(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;before taking any action which would cause an adjustment pursuant to section 7 hereof to reduce the exercise price below the then par value (if any) of the warrant shares, the company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable warrant shares at the exercise price as so adjusted. &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the company covenants that all warrant shares which may be issued upon exercise of warrants shall, upon issue, be fully paid, non-assessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes and liens. &#160; section 6. intentionally omitted &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; section 7. adjustment of exercise price and number of warrant shares issuable &#160; the applicable exercise price and the number of warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of each warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time during the exercise period upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in this section 7; provided that in no event shall the applicable exercise price be less than the then current par value of ordinary shares, provided further that if by virtue of an adjustment under this agreement, the warrant exercise price is to be reduced to below the par value, the company shall take all action practicable to reduce the par value of the ordinary shares to a value equal to and below such adjusted exercise price, and if not practicable, to the lowest practicable value which shall also be the adjusted exercise price. for purposes of this section 7, &#8220;ordinary shares&#8221; includes shares now or hereafter authorized of any class of common stock of the company and any other stock of the company, however designated, that has the right (subject to any prior rights of any class or series of preferred stock) to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the company without limit as to per share amount. &#160; in addition to the adjustments required under this section 7, the company may, at any time, reduce the applicable exercise price to any amount greater than or equal to $0.001 per share for any period of time (but not less than 20 business days) deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the company. &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; adjustment for change in capital stock. &#160; if the company (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its ordinary shares payable in shares of its ordinary shares, (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of ordinary shares into a greater number of shares, (iii) combines its shares of outstanding ordinary shares into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification of its ordinary shares any shares of its capital stock, then the applicable exercise price in effect immediately prior to such action shall, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of the first paragraph of this section 7, be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any warrant thereafter exercised may receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the company which such holder would have owned immediately following such action as if such warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such action. &#160; the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. if, after an adjustment, a holder of a warrant upon exercise of it may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the company, the company shall determine, in good faith, the allocation of the adjusted exercise price between the classes of capital stock. after such allocation, the exercise privilege and the applicable exercise price of each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to ordinary shares in this section 7. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; adjustment for rights issue. &#160; if the company distributes any rights, options or warrants to all holders of its ordinary shares entitling them for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date set forth below to subscribe for ordinary shares or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, ordinary shares, in either case, at a price per share less than the market value per share on that record date, the applicable exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; where: &#160; e &#162; = the adjusted exercise price. &#160; &#160; &#160; e = the then current exercise price. &#160; &#160; &#160; o = the number of ordinary shares outstanding on the record date. &#160; &#160; &#160; n = the number of additional ordinary shares issued pursuant to such rights, options or warrants. &#160; &#160; &#160; p = the price per share of the additional ordinary shares. &#160; &#160; &#160; m = the market value per ordinary share on the record date. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the rights, options or warrants. if at the end of the period during which such rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, the applicable exercise price shall be promptly readjusted to what it would have been if &#8220;n&#8221; in the above formula had been the number of shares actually issued. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; adjustment for other distributions. &#160; if the company distributes to all holders of its ordinary shares any of its assets (including cash), debt securities, preferred stock or any rights or warrants to purchase assets (including cash), debt securities, preferred stock or other securities of the company, the applicable exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: &#160; &#160; where: &#160; e &#162; = the adjusted exercise price. &#160; &#160; &#160; e = the then current exercise price. &#160; &#160; &#160; m = the market value per ordinary share on the record date mentioned below. &#160; &#160; &#160; f = the fair market value on the record date of the debt securities, preferred stock, assets (including cash), securities, rights or warrants to be distributed in respect of one ordinary share as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company based on a written opinion of an internationally recognized investment banking, appraisal or valuation firm that is not an affiliate of the company. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution. &#160; this section 7(c) shall not apply to distributions of stock referred to in section 7(a) or of rights, options or warrants referred to in section 7(b) hereof. &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; adjustment for issuance of ordinary shares. &#160; if the company issues ordinary shares for a consideration per share less than the exercise price per share on the date the company fixes the offering price of such additional shares, the applicable exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: &#160; &#160; where: &#160; e &#162; = the adjusted exercise price. &#160; &#160; &#160; e = the then current exercise price. &#160; &#160; &#160; o = the number of ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such additional shares. &#160; &#160; &#160; p = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such additional shares. &#160; &#160; &#160; a = the number of outstanding ordinary shares immediately after the issuance of such additional ordinary shares. &#160; the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. &#160; this subsection &#8206; (d) shall not apply to: &#160; (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;any of the transactions described in subsections &#8206; (a), &#8206; (b) or &#8206; (c) of this section 7, including, without limitation, the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise thereof, &#160; (2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the exercise of warrants, or the conversion, exchange or exercise of other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for ordinary shares the issuance of which requires an adjustment to be made under section 7(e), &#160; (3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the issuance of ordinary shares to employees, officers or directors of the company or its subsidiaries under other bona fide employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors and approved by the holders of ordinary shares when required by law, if such ordinary shares would otherwise be covered by this subsection &#8206; (d), but only to the extent that the aggregate number of shares excluded hereby and issued after the date of this agreement shall not, together with options exercisable for ordinary shares issued under the employee benefit plans referred to section 7(e)(2), exceed&#160;&#160; 757,240 &#160;&#160;ordinary shares (as adjusted proportionally for stock dividends, stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like) per calendar year, or &#160; (4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the issuance of ordinary shares issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of other securities, warrants, options or similar rights if the conversion, exchange or exercise price is not less than the exercise price per ordinary share at the time the security, warrant, option or right so converted, exchanged or exercised was issued or granted. &#160; 12 &#160; (e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; adjustment for convertible securities issue. &#160; if the company issues any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for ordinary shares (other than securities issued in transactions described in subsections &#8206; (a), &#8206; (b) or &#8206; (c) of this section 7) for a consideration per ordinary share initially deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities less than the exercise price per share on the date of issuance of such securities or on the date the company fixes the offering price of such securities, the applicable exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: &#160; &#160; where: &#160; e &#162; = the adjusted exercise price. &#160; &#160; &#160; e = the then current exercise price. &#160; &#160; &#160; o = the number of ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such securities. &#160; &#160; &#160; p = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such securities. &#160; &#160; &#160; d = the maximum number of ordinary shares deliverable upon conversion or in exchange for such securities at the initial conversion, exchange or exercise rate. &#160; the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. &#160; if all the ordinary shares deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities have not been issued when such securities are no longer outstanding, then the applicable exercise price shall promptly be readjusted to the applicable exercise price which would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such securities been made on the basis of the actual number of ordinary shares issued upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities. &#160; this subsection &#8206; (e) shall not apply to: &#160; (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;convertible securities issued to stockholders of any person which merges into the company, or with a subsidiary of the company, in proportion to their stock holdings of such person immediately prior to such merger, upon such merger, provided that if such person is an affiliate of the company, the board of directors shall have obtained a fairness opinion from a internationally recognized investment banking, appraisal or valuation firm, which is not an affiliate of the company, stating that the consideration received in such merger is fair to the company from a financial point of view, or &#160; (2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the issuance of options exercisable for ordinary shares to employees, officers or directors of the company or its subsidiaries under other bona fide employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors and approved by the holders of ordinary shares when required by law, if such ordinary shares would otherwise be covered by this subsection &#8206; (e), but only to the extent that the aggregate number of shares excluded hereby and issued after the date of this agreement shall not, together with ordinary shares issued under the employee benefit plans referred to in section 7(d)(3), exceed 757,240 ordinary shares (as adjusted proportionally for stock dividends, stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like) per calendar year. &#160;
