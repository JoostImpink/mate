(a) the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder of registrable securities, each of its officers, directors, partners, agents and representatives, and each person controlling such holder, with respect to which such registration, qualification or compliance has been effected pursuant to this agreement, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter of the registrable securities held by or issuable to such holder, against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any preliminary or final prospectus, offering circular or other document (including any related registration statement, notification or the like) incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation or alleged violation by the company relating to action or inaction required of the company in connection with any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act or any blue sky or other state securities law applicable to the company and will reimburse (promptly after the incurrence of such expense) each such holder, each of its officers, directors, partners, agents and representatives and each person controlling such holder, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter, -7- 28 for any reasonable legal and any other expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or settling any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage or liability arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission based upon written information furnished to the company by an instrument duly executed by such holder or underwriter specifically for use therein; provided further, however, that the agreement of the company to indemnify any underwriter and any person who controls such underwriter contained herein with respect to any such preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter from whom the person asserting any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action purchased the stock which is the subject thereof, if at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such stock, a copy of the prospectus (or the prospectus as amended or supplemented) was not sent or delivered to such person, excluding the documents incorporated therein by reference, and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the prospectus (or the prospectus as amended or supplemented). (b) each holder will, if registrable securities held by or issuable to such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors and officers, agents and representatives, each underwriter, if any, of the company's securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, and each other such holder, each of its officers, directors and partners, agents and representatives, and each person controlling such holder, against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any preliminary or final prospectus, offering circular or other document (including any related registration statement, notification or the like) incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse (promptly after the incurrence of such expense) the company, such holder, such directors, officers, partners, persons or underwriters for any reasonable legal or any other expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or settling any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by an instrument duly executed by such holder specifically for use therein; provided, however, that the agreement of the holder to indemnify any underwriter and any person who controls such underwriter contained herein with respect to any such preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter from whom the person asserting any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action purchased the stock which is the subject thereof, if at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such stock, a copy of the prospectus (or the prospectus as amended or supplemented) was not sent or delivered to such person, excluding the documents incorporated therein by reference, and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the prospectus (or the prospectus as amended or supplemented); provided further, however, that in no event shall the indemnification provided by any holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds received by such holder for the sale of such holder's registrable securities pursuant to such registration. -8- 29 (c) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 2.5 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided, however, that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense; provided further, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder, unless such failure is materially prejudicial to an indemnifying party's ability to defend such action. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 2.6 information by holder. the holder or holders of registrable securities included in any registration shall promptly furnish to the company such information regarding such holder or holders and the distribution proposed by such holder or holders as the company may request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein. 2.7 rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available to holders of registrable securities the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") that may permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, the company agrees at all times hereafter to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 promulgated under the securities act; (b) file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"); (c) so long as a holder holds registrable securities, furnish to such holder copies of all of the company's periodic and other reports, proxy materials and other documents made available to the company's stockholders generally; and (d) so long as a holder owns any registrable securities, furnish to such holder forthwith upon such holder's request a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said rule 144, and of the securities act and the exchange act, and such other reports and documents filed by the company as such holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing such holder to sell any such securities without registration. -9- 30 2.8 transfer of registration rights. the rights to cause the company to register registrable securities of a holder and keep information available, granted to a holder by the company under sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.7 may be assigned by any holder to a transferee or assignee reasonably acceptable to the company representing in aggregate at least 3% of the then-outstanding common stock of the company; provided, however, that (i) the company is given written notice by the holder at the time of or within a reasonable time after said transfer, stating the name and address of said transferee or assignee and identifying the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned, and (ii) any such transferee or assignee shall agree in writing to become subject to the obligations of the transferring holder hereunder. 2.9 termination. all rights of each holder under sections 2.1 and 2.2 will terminate on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the date of this agreement, and (ii) with respect to such holder when such holder holds registrable securities representing less than 1% of the then-outstanding common stock of the company and such holder's registrable securities are freely saleable under rule 144 promulgated under the securities act. section 3 company right of first refusal as to sales by synopsys 3.1 the right. if at any time synopsys proposes to offer to sell any shares ("offered shares") to one or more third parties in a transaction not registered under the securities act in reliance upon a claimed exemption thereunder (other than a transaction pursuant to rule 144 promulgated under the securities act) and the company's common stock is then quoted on the nasdaq national market (or any national securities exchange), then synopsys will (i) prepare in good faith and deliver to the company a list of the third party or parties to whom synopsys proposes to offer to sell the offered shares and the number of offered shares proposed to be offered, and (ii) grant to the company the right, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this section 3, to purchase up to all of the offered shares at a per-share price equal to the market price of the offered shares on the date of such notice. the date the company is deemed to have received such notice (as determined pursuant to section 9.4) is referred to as the "synopsys notice date". within five business days after receiving such notice, the company will notify synopsys of the number of offered shares, if any, that it wishes to purchase pursuant to this section 3. if the company gives synopsys notice that it desires to purchase a portion of the offered shares, then within 15 business days after the synopsys notice date synopsys will sell and deliver such portion of the offered shares to the company against payment therefor in cash, by check or wire transfer, at a place agreed upon between the parties and at the time of the scheduled closing therefor. 3.2 failure to exercise. if the company has not elected to purchase all of the offered shares or if the company has failed to close the purchase of any offered shares that it has elected to purchase within 15 business days of the synopsys notice date through no fault of synopsys, then synopsys may thereafter sell or enter into a binding agreement to sell any remaining offered shares to one or more of the third parties named in the foregoing list within 90 days of the synopsys notice -10- 31 date. in the event that synopsys has not sold such offered shares or entered into a binding agreement to sell such offered shares within 90 days of the synopsys notice date, synopsys may not thereafter sell such offered shares without again first offering such offered shares to the company in accordance with this section 3. section 4 right of participation 4.1 the right. synopsys has the right of first refusal to purchase up to synopsys' pro rata share of any new securities that the company may from time to time issue after the date of this agreement (the "right of participation"); provided, however, that synopsys shall not have the right of participation with respect to any issuance of new securities that, when cumulated with all prior issuances of new securities as to which synopsys would have had a right of participation but for this proviso, would result in less than a 10% reduction in synopsys' pro rata share. 4.2 procedures. in the event that the company proposes to undertake an issuance of new securities (in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) that would result in a 10% or greater reduction in synopsys' pro rata share, the company will give to synopsys written notice of its intention to issue new securities (the "participation notice"), describing the amount and the type of new securities and the price and the general terms upon which the company proposes to issue such new securities. synopsys will have five business days from the date of receipt of any such participation notice to agree in writing to purchase synopsys' pro rata share of such new securities upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in the participation notice by giving written notice to the company and stating therein the quantity of new securities to be purchased (not to exceed synopsys' pro rata share); provided, however, that the per share purchase price for such new securities will not exceed $15.00 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and the like) during the period from the date of this agreement until the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the date of this agreement, and (ii) such time as the total number of shares of common stock purchased by synopsys (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and the like) pursuant to the right of participation and the right of maintenance exceeds 242,390. if synopsys fails to so agree in writing within such five-business-day period to purchase synopsys' full pro rata share of an offering of new securities, then synopsys shall forfeit the right under this section 4 to purchase that part of its pro rata share of such new securities that it did not so agree to purchase. synopsys shall purchase the portion elected by synopsys concurrently with the closing of the transaction triggering the right of participation. 4.3 failure to exercise. upon the expiration of such five-business-day period, the company will have 120 days thereafter to sell the new securities described in the participation notice (with respect to which synopsys' right of first refusal hereunder was not exercised) at the same or higher price and upon non-price terms not materially more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the participation notice. in the event that the company has not issued and sold such new securities within such 120-day period, then the company shall not thereafter issue or sell any new securities without again first offering such new securities to synopsys pursuant to this section 4. -11- 32 section 5 right of maintenance 5.1 general. synopsys will, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this section 5, have the right to purchase shares of voting stock ("maintenance securities") from the company at the per share purchase price (as defined in section 5.2) following the issuance by the company of dilutive securities after the date of this agreement, solely in order to maintain synopsys' prior percentage interest in the company (the "right of maintenance"). each right to purchase maintenance securities pursuant to this section 5 shall be on the same terms (other than price to the extent provided in section 5.2 below) as the issuance of the dilutive securities that gave rise to the right to purchase such maintenance securities. 5.2 purchase price. (a) employee stock. to the extent that the right of maintenance arises out of the issuance of dilutive securities to employees, officers, directors, contractors, advisors or consultants of the company pursuant to incentive agreements or incentive plans approved by the board of directors of the company ("employee stock"), the per share "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the market price of such maintenance securities on the date on which synopsys purchases such maintenance securities. (b) other dilutive securities. to the extent that the right of maintenance arises out of any issuance of dilutive securities other than employee stock, the per share "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the per share price at which such dilutive securities were issued, unless the issuance of such other dilutive securities occurred upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of other securities ("exchangeable securities"), in which case, the per share "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the sum of (i) the per share amounts paid upon each such exercise, conversion or exchange, and (ii) the per share amount previously paid for the exchangeable securities (adjusted for any stock split, stock dividends or other similar events). (c) consideration other than cash. in the event that dilutive securities or exchangeable securities were issued for consideration other than cash, the per share amounts paid for such dilutive securities or exchangeable securities shall be determined jointly by the company and synopsys. (d) appraiser. if the company and synopsys are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time with respect to (i) the market price of maintenance securities not quoted on the nasdaq national market (or, if applicable, a national securities exchange), or (ii) the per share amounts paid for dilutive securities or exchangeable securities issued for consideration other than cash, such market price or per share amounts paid, as the case may be, shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the company and synopsys. the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be paid for by the company, provided that such fees and expenses shall be paid for by synopsys -12- 33 in the event that the appraiser's determination of the market price or the per share amounts paid, as the case may be, is higher than, or not more that 5% lower than, the last amount previously offered by the company. (e) purchase price cap. notwithstanding the foregoing, the per share purchase price will not exceed $15.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends or other similar events) during the period from the closing until the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the closing date, and (ii) such time as the total number of shares of common stock purchased by synopsys (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and the like) pursuant to the right of participation and the right of maintenance exceeds 242,390. 5.3 maintenance amount. synopsys' "maintenance amount" with respect to any maintenance notice shall equal such number of maintenance securities as is obtained by multiplying the number of dilutive securities specified in such maintenance notice by synopsys' prior percentage interest, rounded to the nearest whole share, plus, with respect to the first maintenance notice only, 5,409 shares of common stock. 5.4 notice of issuance. within 15 business days of (x) march 24, 1997, (y) the end of each of the company's fiscal years commencing with its 1997 fiscal year, and (z) any of the company's fiscal quarters in which there was an issuance of dilutive securities which when cumulated with all prior issuance of dilutive securities since the later of (i) the date of this agreement, or (ii) the date of the last maintenance notice (subsequent to which synopsys has had an opportunity to purchase maintenance securities), results in a 10% reduction in synopsys' prior percentage interest, the company shall give to synopsys written notice (the "maintenance notice") describing the number of dilutive securities issued since the date of the prior maintenance notice and the non-price terms upon which the company issued such dilutive securities, and the maintenance amount of maintenance securities that synopsys is entitled to purchase. 5.5 purchase of maintenance securities. synopsys will have 15 business days from the receipt of a maintenance notice to elect to purchase up to synopsys' maintenance amount of such maintenance securities at the purchase price and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in the maintenance notice. the closing of such purchase shall occur within five business days after such election to purchase or at such later date as the parties may agree. if synopsys fails to elect to purchase synopsys' full maintenance amount of maintenance securities within such 15-business-day period, then synopsys shall forfeit the right under this section 5 to purchase that part of synopsys' maintenance amount that it did not so elect to purchase. section 6 standstill agreement 6.1 prohibition. synopsys (which, for purposes of this section 6 includes synopsys and all of its subsidiaries) will not, directly or indirectly, acquire, or enter into discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any third party to acquire prior to the expiration of this section 6 (including, without limitation, the lapse of the negative covenants of this section 6.1 upon -13- 34 the occurrence of any of the events described in section 6.1(a) through (c)), beneficial ownership of any voting stock, any securities convertible into or exchangeable for voting stock, or any other right to acquire voting stock (except, in any case, by way of stock dividends or other distributions or offerings made available to the holders of voting stock generally) without the written consent of the company, if the effect of such acquisition would be to increase the voting power of all voting stock then owned by synopsys or which synopsys has a right to acquire to more than 9.9% of the total voting power of all voting stock then outstanding; provided, however, that synopsys may acquire voting stock without regard to the foregoing limitation: (a) if any person or group (other than messrs. cooper and chyan and their family members) not affiliated with synopsys and then owning voting stock representing at least 5% of the voting power of all voting stock then outstanding provides written notice to the company or files any document with the commission that contains terms that put the company reasonably on notice of the likelihood that such person or group has acquired or is proposing to acquire any shares of voting stock or the right to acquire shares of voting stock having aggregate voting power of more than 50% of the total voting power of all shares of voting stock then outstanding and, in the case of a proposal to acquire such shares, the proposal and any related offers to purchase shares are not withdrawn or terminated prior to synopsys making an offer to acquire voting stock or acquiring voting stock in response thereto; provided, however, that the negative covenants of this section 6.1 will resume following the withdrawal of any proposal or offer to purchase shares made in accordance with this section 6.1(a); (b) if it is publicly disclosed or synopsys otherwise learns that the company has entered into any letter of intent or agreement with a person or group that, if consummated, would result in such person or group owning or having the right to acquire shares of voting stock having aggregate voting power of more than 50% of the total voting power of all shares of voting stock then outstanding; (c) after the fifth anniversary of the date of this agreement. 6.2 exceptions. synopsys will not be obligated to dispose of voting stock if the aggregate percentage of the total voting power of all voting stock then outstanding represented by voting stock owned by synopsys or which synopsys has the right to acquire is increased as a result of a recapitalization of the company, a repurchase of securities by the company or any other action taken by the company or any of its affiliates, and, in any of such events, the percentage set forth in the first paragraph of section 6.1 thereafter will be deemed increased to the percentage of voting stock owned by synopsys immediately following such event. 6.3 percentage adjustment. in the event synopsys purchases or otherwise acquires any shares of voting stock in a transaction permitted by section 6.1(a) before the resumption of the negative covenants of section 6.1, the percentage set forth in the first paragraph of section 6.1 thereafter will be deemed increased to the percentage of voting stock owned by synopsys after such purchase or acquisition. -14- 35 6.4 excluded shares. for purposes of this agreement, synopsys will not be deemed to have beneficial ownership of any voting stock held by a synopsys pension plan or other employee benefit program if synopsys does not have the power to control the investment decisions of such plan or program. section 7 change of control 7.1 notice of acquisition offer. the company or the selling stockholders shall give synopsys at least five business days' notice prior to: (a) the company or any of the selling stockholders accepting any offer from any entity or group to acquire any shares of voting stock which would result in such person or group owning or having the right to acquire (i) more than 50% of the voting stock of the company then outstanding, or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of the company; or (b) the company's board of directors approving any merger or consolidation of the company with or into any other entity in which the company's stockholder's prior to any such transaction do not hold more than 50% of the voting power in the surviving entity. 7.2 notice of counterproposal. if within such five-day period following the notice referred to above, synopsys shall make a counterproposal and such proposal results in a further proposal from any party, then the company or the selling stockholder, as the case may be, will give synopsys at least three business days' notice of such further proposal prior to accepting the same. 7.3 reduction of notice period. the notice periods referred to in this section 7 may be reduced or eliminated by resolution of the company's board of directors to the extent (and only to the extent) that it specifically determines, based upon the advice of counsel, that providing such notice would constitute a violation of its fiduciary obligations. section 8 additional rights; termination of certain rights 8.1 pro rata repurchase. in the event that the company repurchases shares of its voting stock from a third party, the company will make lawful provision to offer to, and have the legal right to, repurchase shares of voting stock from synopsys to the extent necessary so that the voting power of all voting stock then owned by synopsys or which synopsys then has a right to acquire does not exceed 10% of the total voting power of all voting stock then outstanding. 8.2 limitation on sale of shares. prior to the first date on which synopsys may exercise its registration rights under section 2, none of the selling stockholders may sell (including, without limitation, any short sale), offer to sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of the -15- 36 common stock, or any options or warrants to purchase any of the common stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of the common stock, owned directly by such selling stockholder, or with respect to which such selling stockholder has the power of disposition, in any such case whether now owned or hereafter acquired; provided, however, that a selling stockholder may sell or transfer such securities (i) to members of such selling stockholder's family, and (ii) in a registered public offering with respect to which synopsys has registration rights pursuant to section 2.2. 8.3 termination of certain rights. the rights and obligations of the parties under sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the fifth anniversary of the closing date, (ii) the first date that synopsys holds less than 50% of the number of shares purchased by synopsys at the closing pursuant to the purchase agreement (such number to be proportionately adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and similar events), (iii) the expiration of or any termination of either the joint marketing agreement or the cooperative development agreement, each dated the date of this agreement between the company and synopsys (collectively, the "ancillary agreements"), in accordance with their respective terms for any reason (except, at synopsys' option, for a termination by synopsys due to an uncured breach by the company of one of the company's material obligations under either of such agreements), (iv) at the option of the company, upon any failure by synopsys to perform its golden flow obligations, as such term is defined in the ancillary agreements, under either of the ancillary agreements permitting the company to terminate either of the ancillary agreements in accordance with its respective terms, (v) at synopsys' option, upon any failure by the company to perform its golden flow obligations under either of the ancillary agreements permitting synopsys to terminate either of the ancillary agreements in accordance with its respective terms, or (vi) immediately prior to the closing of any acquisition. section 9 miscellaneous 9.1 amendment and waiver. any term of this agreement may be amended and the observance of any such term may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with the written consent of the company and holders holding at least a majority of the outstanding registrable securities. 9.2 governing law. this agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the state of california, as such laws are applied to agreements among california residents entered into and to be performed entirely within california. 9.3 successors and assigns. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto. 9.4 entire agreement. the transaction documents (as defined in the purchase agreement) and the other documents delivered pursuant thereto constitute the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subjects thereof. -16- 37 9.5 notices, etc. all notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by facsimile, overnight courier or mailed by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the facsimile number or address as follows: company: cooper & chyan technology, inc. 1601 south de anza boulevard cupertino, california 95014 telephone: (408) 342-5518 facsimile: (408) 342-5650 attention: mr. john r. harding, president with a copy (which will not constitute notice) to: fenwick & west two palo alto square, suite 800 palo alto, california 94306 telephone: (415) 494-0600 facsimile: (415) 857-0361 attention: gordon davidson, esq. synopsys: synopsys, inc. 700 east middlefield road mountain view, california 94043-4033 telephone: (415) 962-5000 facsimile: (415) 694-4087 attention: paul lippe, vice president, legal with a copy (which will not constitute notice) to: wilson, sonsini, goodrich & rosati 650 page mill road palo alto, california 94304-1050 telephone: (415) 493-9300 facsimile: (415) 493-6811 attention: thomas c. defilipps, esq. selling c/o cooper & chyan technology, inc. stockholders: 1601 south de anza boulevard cupertino, california 95014 telephone: (408) 342-5518 facsimile: (408) 342-5650 or to such other facsimile number or address provided to the parties to this agreement in accordance with this section 9.5. such notices or other communications shall be deemed delivered upon receipt, in the case of overnight delivery or facsimile transmission (as evidenced by the confirmation thereof), or 3 days after deposit in the mails (as determined by reference to the postmark). -17- 38 9.6 assignment. rights under section 2 may be assigned only in accordance with the provisions of section 2.8. rights of synopsys under sections 4, 5, and 7 may not be assigned (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the company;
