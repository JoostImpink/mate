&#147;offer&#148;) to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the company&#146;s common stock, $0.00005 par value per share, at a price of $13.86 per share (the &#147;offer price&#148;) net to the company&#146;s stockholders in cash, less any withholding taxes. the company&#146;s board of directors has unanimously approved, and determined to recommend that the stockholders of the company accept, the offer. parent and purchaser have agreed to commence the offer as promptly as practicable, but no later than september 11, 2017 or such other date as the parties may agree. the consummation of the offer will be conditioned on (i) there having been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn shares that represent a majority of the total number of shares issued and outstanding at the time of the expiration of the offer, (ii) expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the merger agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms and (iv) other customary conditions contained on annex a to the merger agreement. following the consummation of the offer, the parties have agreed that, following the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the closing of the merger, parent shall execute a &#147;short-form&#148; merger (the &#147;merger&#148;) pursuant to section 251(h) of the delaware general corporation law, which will not require any vote or consent of the company&#146;s stockholders. as a result of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of the company&#146;s common stock (other than shares of company common stock held by parent and its subsidiaries or held by the company, or held by stockholders who are entitled to exercise, and who properly exercise, appraisal rights) that is not tendered pursuant to the offer will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the offer price on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement. following the effective time of the merger (the &#147;effective time&#148;), the separate corporate existence of purchaser shall cease, and the company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and become an indirect subsidiary of parent. the merger agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this type, including, among other things, a covenant of the company not to solicit alternative transactions or to provide information or enter into discussions in connection with alternative transactions, subject to certain exceptions to allow the company&#146;s board of directors to exercise its fiduciary duties. the members of the board of directors of the purchaser immediately prior to the effective time shall be the initial directors of the surviving corporation and the officers of the company immediately prior to the effective time shall be the initial officers of the surviving corporation. at the effective time, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the surviving corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the effective time. each party to the merger agreement further agreed to cooperate in taking actions necessary to (i) delist the common stock from the nasdaq stock market llc and (ii) to terminate the registration of the common stock under the exchange act. the merger agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including in specified circumstances in connection with superior proposals. upon the termination of the merger agreement, under specified circumstances, the company will be required to pay parent, or its designee, a termination fee of $3,864,000. in the event the conditions to consummating the offer have been met on the date the offer would otherwise expire and purchaser does not accept for payment and pay for the tendered shares as a result of parent not having received the full amount of parent&#146;s debt financing, the company may terminate the merger agreement and parent shall be required to pay the company a termination fee equal to $5,313,000. assuming the satisfaction of applicable conditions, the parties expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2017. the foregoing summary of
