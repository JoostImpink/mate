(a) through (j) the purpose of the acquisition of common stock contemplated by national union is for investment. national union, the issuer, tutor-saliba corporation ("tutor-saliba") and o&g industries, inc. ("o&g") have entered into a securities purchase agreement, dated as of february 5, 2000 (the "securities purchase agreement"), pursuant to which national union, tutor-saliba and o&g have agreed to purchase 4,705,882, 2,352,941 and 2,352,941 shares, respectively, of the common stock of the issuer. the securities purchase agreement is subject to certain significant contingencies including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of due diligence by national union and o&g, the exchange of 100% of the issuer's outstanding series b cumulative convertible preferred stock (the "series b preferred stock") for common stock, the renegotiation of the issuer's current credit facilities and stockholder approval. in connection with the closing (the "closing") of the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement, national union, tutor-saliba, ronald n. tutor ("rnt"), o&g, the issuer and certain other parties will execute and become parties to a shareholders agreement (the "shareholders agreement") and a registration rights agreement (the "registration rights agreement"). the shareholders agreement will give national union the right, under certain circumstances, to put some or all of the shares of common stock it will purchase to tutor-saliba and/or rnt for a price specified in the shareholders agreement. similarly, it will give tutor-saliba and rnt the right, under certain circumstances, to call such shares of common stock from national union for a price specified in the shareholders agreement. the shareholders agreement will prohibit national union, tutor-saliba, o&g, their transferees, and the holders of the series b preferred stock that are exchanging their shares for common stock (the "exchanging holders") from transferring any shares of common stock for three years following the closing if such transfer would result in a limitation being placed on the deductibility of the issuer's net operating loss carry forwards under section 382 of the internal revenue code. national union, tutor-saliba, o&g and the exchanging holders will also agree to vote their shares of common stock against any stock issuance or redemption by the issuer if that issuance or redemption would result in such a limitation and to use reasonable efforts to cause any directors designated by them to oppose any such transaction. the shareholders agreement will give each of national union and tutor-saliba a right of first refusal on dispositions of issuer stock by each other, and will give national union, tutor-saliba, o&g and the exchanging holders rights to sell when any other party sells its issuer stock. the shareholders agreement also provides, subject to certain shareholding requirements, that each of national union, tutor-saliba, o&g and two of the exchanging holders shall have the right to designate one director each to be appointed to the board of directors of the issuer at the closing and, thereafter, to be nominated to the board of directors of the issuer by the nominating committee of such board. the issuer will agree to use its best efforts to cause such persons to be elected as directors and each of national union, tutor-saliba, o&g and the exchanging holders will agree to vote their shares of common stock of the issuer in favor of each others' nominees. the shareholders agreement will also give national union, tutor-saliba, o&g and the exchanging holders pre-emptive rights with respect to certain issuances of securities by the issuer. the shareholders agreement will expire on the sixth anniversary of the closing. the registration rights agreement will grant to national union, tutor-saliba, o&g and the exchanging holders certain demand and "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock of the issuer owned by them immediately following consummation of the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement. subject to certain restrictions set forth in the securities purchase agreement and the shareholders agreement and applicable legal requirements, aig and national union may purchase additional shares of common stock from time to time or may dispose of all or a portion of their shares of common stock. aig and national union intend to consider and review various factors on a continuous basis, including without limitation the issuer's financial condition, business and prospects, other developments concerning the issuer, the price and availability of shares of common stock, other investment and business opportunities available to aig and national union, developments with respect to the business of aig and national union, and general economic, money or stock market conditions in managing their investments in the common stock. except as set forth above, aig and national union do not have any present plans or proposals which relate to, or could result in, any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) through (j) of this item 4. subject to certain restrictions set forth in the securities purchase agreement and shareholders agreement and applicable law, aig and national union may, at any time and from time to time, review or reconsider their position and formulate plans or proposals with respect thereto, but have no present intentions of doing so. -6- 7 item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) and (b) the information required by these paragraphs is set forth in items 7 through 11 and 13 of each of the cover pages of this schedule 13d and is based upon (i) information provided by the issuer that 5,682,287 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 5, 2000 and (ii) an assumption that the closing will occur on march 15, 2000 and that 7,461,398 shares of common stock will be issued to the holders of the series b preferred stock in connection with the closing. if the closing occurs after march 15, 2000, the number of shares of common stock issued to the holders of the series b preferred stock will increase at a rate of approximately 2,073 shares of common stock per day. (c) aig, national union, sico, starr foundation and starr, and, to the best of aig's and national union's knowledge, the covered persons, have not engaged in any transactions in common stock within the past 60 days other than those transactions described in this schedule 13d. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. other than the securities purchase agreement, the shareholders agreement and the registration rights agreement described in item 4 of this schedule 13d, neither aig or national union nor, to the best of aig's or national union's knowledge, any of sico, starr foundation or starr nor any of the covered persons, has any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or losses, or the giving or withholding of proxies. -7- 8 item 7. material to be filed as exhibits.

provided that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by or on behalf of such holder specifically for use in the preparation thereof. in addition, the company shall indemnify any underwriter of such offering and each other person, if any, who controls any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act in substantially the same manner and to substantially the same extent as the indemnity herein provided to each indemnified party. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such holder or any such director, officer, underwriter or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such holder. section 7.2 seller indemnification. each prospective seller of registrable securities hereunder severally, and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 7.1) the company, each director of the company, each officer of the company and each other person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, with respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by or on behalf of such seller specifically for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus or amendment or supplement. any such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. the amount payable by any prospective seller of registrable securities with respect to the indemnification set forth in this section 7.2 in connection with any offering of registrable securities will not exceed the amount of the gain realized by such prospective seller pursuant to such offering. section 7.3 indemnification procedure. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding sections of this article vii, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding sections of this article vii, 21 22 except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to the extent that the indemnifying party may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any such action which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. no indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any such action the defense of which has been assumed by an indemnifying party without the consent of such indemnifying party. section 7.4 remedies.

(c) notwithstanding the other provisions of this section 7.4, no holder of registrable securities or underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which (i) in the case of any such holder, the gain realized by such holder from the sale of registrable securities or (ii) in the case of an underwriter, the total price at which the registrable securities purchased by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds, in any such case, the amount of any damages that such holder or underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. article viii reports section 8.1 rule 144; rule 144a; form s-3.
