schedule 13d statement of tele-communications, inc. pursuant to section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 in respect of home shopping network, inc. this report on schedule 13d relates to the common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "common stock"), of home shopping network, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"). the report on schedule 13d originally filed by tele-communications, inc., a delaware corporation ("tci" or the "reporting person"), on august 12, 1994, as amended and supplemented by the amendments thereto previously filed with the commission (collectively, the "tci schedule 13d"), is hereby amended and supplemented to include the information contained herein, and this report constitutes amendment no. 4 to the tci schedule 13d. the summary descriptions contained in this report of certain agreements and documents are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete texts of such agreements and documents, filed as exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. item 4. purpose of transaction ---------------------- item 4 of the tci schedule 13d is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following information thereto: as previously reported, in light of the limitations relating to increases in tci's percentage equity ownership of silver king contained in the fcc june order, diller and tci had begun discussions with respect to a restructuring of the proposed transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the exchange agreement or a possible alternative transaction relating to the company. in this regard, diller and tci considered a transaction which would result in a merger of a subsidiary of silver king into the company (the "hsn merger") pursuant to which a portion of tci's page 2 of 8 pages consideration in the hsn merger would consist of a contingent right to acquire silver king shares and a portion of its interest in the company would become an interest in the surviving corporation in the hsn merger. such contingent right and such interest in the surviving corporation would each be exchangeable into silver king shares, in each case, when and as permitted under applicable fcc regulations, including the fcc june order. on august 25, 1996, the boards of directors of silver king and the company (based, in the case of the company, upon the recommendation of a special committee of independent members of the board of directors of the company) approved a merger transaction and related transactions pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of silver king ("sub") would be merged with and into the company, with the result that the company would be the surviving corporation and become an 80.1% owned subsidiary of silver king following the hsn merger (with tci owning the remaining 19.9% interest in the surviving corporation). in connection with the hsn merger, substantially all of tci's shares of class b stock of the company would be converted into silver king class b common stock, which would then be contributed to an entity ("bdtv ii") in which diller owns all of the voting equity interests and tci owns a non-voting equity interest (which non-voting interest constitutes substantially all the equity of bdtv ii). if the hsn merger is consummated, the company would become a consolidated subsidiary of silver king. the hsn merger would cause the common stock to be eligible for termination of registration under the exchange act and to be delisted from the new york stock exchange. tci would no longer have a controlling interest in the company. because substantially all of the shares of silver king class b common stock receivable by tci in the hsn merger will be contributed to bdtv ii, an entity which (other than with respect to certain fundamental corporate actions) is controlled by diller, tci will not initially have a controlling interest in silver king. in connection with the execution of the hsn merger agreement (as defined below), silver king, liberty and certain of liberty's subsidiaries entered into a voting agreement, dated august 25, 1996 (the "voting agreement"), pursuant to which such liberty entities agreed to vote the tci hsn shares in favor of the hsn merger and to vote the tci hsn shares against any action or agreement that would impede, delay or discourage the hsn merger. in addition, pursuant to such voting agreement, such liberty entities agreed not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the tci hsn shares except pursuant to the hsn merger or following a termination of the hsn merger agreement. tci has not made any determination as to its plans or proposals with respect to the securities of the company in the event that the hsn merger is not consummated. in reaching any decision as to its course of action (as well as to the specific elements thereof), tci expects that it would take into consideration a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the company's business and prospects, other developments concerning the company and the cable television and entertainment programming industries generally, other business opportunities available to tci and other developments with respect to the business of tci, general economic conditions and money and stock market conditions, including the market price of the common stock. tci specifically reserves the right to change its intention with respect to any of the foregoing matters in the event the hsn merger is not consummated, and to take any other available course of action, which could involve one or more of the types of transactions or have one or more of the results described in item 4 of schedule 13d. page 3 of 8 pages item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. ------------------------------------- if the hsn merger is consummated, 19,260,859 shares of class b stock would be converted into 7,756,564 shares of silver king class b common stock and the contingent right to acquire 2,644,299 shares of silver king class b common stock. 739,141 shares of class b would be exchanged for an equal number of shares of the surviving corporation and 17,566,702 shares of common stock would be exchanged for a like number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation. such shares of the surviving corporation would be exchangeable for shares of silver king stock at the same ratio specified in the hsn merger agreement. as a result, in the hsn merger tci would dispose of its entire equity interest in the company. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationship with respect -------------------------------------------------------------------- to the securities of the issuer ------------------------------- item 6 of the tci schedule 13d is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following information thereto: the information set forth in item 4 above is hereby incorporated by reference herein. pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of exchange and merger (the "hsn merger agreement"), dated as of august 25, 1996, by and among the company, silver king, sub and liberty hsn, inc. (the subsidiary of tci which holds the tci hsn shares), holders of common stock would receive 0.45 of a share of silver king common stock for each share of common stock. the class b stock, which is solely held by tci, would be converted into 0.54 of a share of silver king class b common stock in the hsn merger. in order to comply with the fcc june order (which limited tci's percentage equity interest in silver king to 21.37% unless prior fcc approval was obtained), tci agreed in the hsn merger agreement (i) to exchange 17,566,702 shares of common stock and 739,141 shares of class b stock with sub prior to the hsn merger, which shares would become shares of common stock and class b common stock of the surviving corporation in the hsn merger and, upon tci being entitled to own such shares in accordance with applicable fcc regulations, would be exchanged (pursuant to an exchange agreement to be entered into by silver king and liberty hsn, inc. prior to the hsn merger) into silver king common stock and silver king class b common stock at the same rate such company shares would have been converted into silver king shares in the hsn merger, and (ii) approximately 2.6 million of the approximately 10.4 million shares of silver king class b common stock to which tci would be entitled to receive in the hsn merger would become "contingent shares" to be issued to tci at such time as tci would be entitled, under applicable fcc regulations, to own such shares. in the event that any contingent shares remained to be issued after the third anniversary of the hsn merger, such shares would also be issuable to tci at such time as it received fcc approval (including an fcc approval allowing tci to own such shares for a limited period of time in order to effect the disposition of such shares) on or before the fifth anniversary of the hsn merger. if such contingent shares are issued to tci after the third anniversary of the hsn merger and sold by it, silver king will be obligated to issue to tci an additional number of shares to compensate it for certain taxes payable as a result of such sale. the consummation of the hsn merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to, approval by the stockholders of the company (which will include, in addition to the stockholder approval required under delaware law, approval by the holders of a majority of the common stock voting at the meeting at which the hsn merger is to be considered, excluding liberty) page 4 of 8 pages and approval by the stockholders of silver king of the issuance of the shares of silver king common stock and silver king class b common stock in the hsn merger (including the future issuances to tci of the contingent shares and the shares issuable to tci upon the exchange of its shares of the surviving corporation), and the receipt of certain regulatory consents and approvals, including approval by the fcc. if the hsn merger is not consummated by september 1, 1997, each of the company, silver king and tci have the right to terminate the transaction. there can be no assurance that these conditions will be met. in connection with the execution of the hsn merger agreement, liberty and diller also entered into a letter agreement, dated as of august 25, 1996 (the "amendment agreement"), which amended the sk stockholders agreement and by its terms superseded the amendment to the sk stockholders agreement entered into by diller and liberty on november 27, 1995. the amendment agreement does not effect a material change in the relationship between diller and liberty with respect to the equity securities of silver king as described in amendment no. 2 to the tci schedule 13d, except that diller no longer has an obligation to use reasonable best efforts to cause a designee of tci to serve on the board of directors of the company. as described in amendment no. 2, diller has the right to exercise voting authority over all equity securities of silver king owned by tci, subject to certain restrictions. the securities of silver king acquired by tci in the hsn merger, including shares acquired in connection with the contingent interest and upon exchange of securities of the surviving corporation in the hsn merger, will be subject to the sk stockholders agreement. the parties to the merger agreement, dated november 27, 1995, and the exchange agreement, dated november 27, 1995, entered into a termination agreement, dated as of august 25, 1996 which terminated the merger agreement and the exchange agreement upon execution and delivery of the hsn merger agreement. the foregoing summary descriptions of the hsn merger agreement, the amendment agreement, the voting agreement and the termination agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete texts of such agreements, filed as exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits --------------------------------

network, inc. announce agreement to merge new york ny -- silver king communications, inc. (nasdaq: sktv) and home shopping network, inc. (nyse: hsn) today entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which home shopping network (hsn) will become a subsidiary of silver king. the merger marks the reunification of the two companies which split in 1992 and supersedes silver king's previous agreement to purchase only liberty media corp.'s (nasdaq: lbtya) controlling interest in hsn. combined, silver king and home shopping network occupy a unique position with cable, broadcast and electronic retailing programming interests. in addition to hsn's pioneering electronic retailing business and silver king's television broadcast group, the sixth largest in the nation (with interests in 21 full- power stations), the new company's assets will include the internet shopping network (isn), one of the largest electronic retailers on the internet; vela research, specializing in digital video encoder/decoder technology; and, pending consummation of silver king's merger agreement with savoy pictures entertainment, inc. (nasdaq: spei), sf broadcasting, which owns and operates vhf fox affiliates in four major markets. silver king and hsn agree to merge page 2 of 5 under the terms of the merger agreement, holders of hsn common stock will receive 0.45 of a share of silver king common stock for each share of hsn common stock. each share of hsn class b stock, which has ten votes per share and is held solely by liberty media corp., will be converted into 0.54 of a share of silver king class b stock. the consideration to be received by liberty media represents a premium of 10.67 percent on its aggregate holdings of hsn common stock and class b stock. consummation of the merger is subject to silver king and hsn shareholder approvals. approval from hsn shareholders will include the majority decision of holders of hsn common stock voting at the meeting, excluding liberty media corp. approval from silver king shareholders will include the majority decision of holders of silver king common stock. "at no risk of overstatement, this is a complex transaction," stated silver king and hsn chairman barry diller. "not that it needs suggestion, but given the interrelationships of hsn's and silver king's businesses, its chairman, and liberty media's large shareholdings in both companies, i invite a detailed evaluation of the proposed merger. i am confident that such scrutiny will support the transaction's minimum criteria, i.e. that it is fair and balanced and in the best interest of all shareholders. as to its more expansive possibilities, i believe the combination will allow the companies the very best way to pursue their very aggressive individual agendas with clarity and without conflict." silver king and hsn agree to merge page 3 of 5 to represent the interests of home shopping network's shareholders other than liberty media and barry diller, hsn's board of directors formed a special committee of independent directors, which in turn retained independent counsel and financial advisors to negotiate the terms of the merger. the committee approved the transaction, which was subsequently approved by hsn's board of directors based on the committee's recommendation. "this merger enhances the value of both silver king communications and home shopping network," stated hsn board member and chief executive officer james held. "hsn is directly on target with a realistic but aggressive revenue growth plan while silver king's business plan has significant upside potential. combined, the company can nurture its subsidiaries more efficiently and has the proper base to support entirely new ventures that capitalize on its collective assets." as liberty media corp. may not at this time own more than a 21.37 percent equity interest in silver king without further federal communications commission (fcc) approval, initially liberty media will not exchange 18.3 million hsn shares (17.57 million shares of common stock and 0.74 million shares of class b stock) for silver king securities. instead, liberty media will retain a 19.9% minority interests in hsn, which, under the terms of the merger, must be exchanged, in a tax-free transaction, for additional silver king shares as soon as possible consistent with applicable fcc guidelines. silver king and hsn agree to merge page 4 of 5 additionally, approximately 2.6 million contingent shares of silver king class b stock due liberty media for shares of hsn class b stock acquired in the merger will not be issued until such time as liberty media is legally permitted to own them. silver king management believes it highly unlikely that this exchange will not be completed within three years of the consummation of the merger agreement. however, if at the end of three years any of the 2.6 million silver king contingent shares have not been issued, liberty media would also have the right during the next two years to dispose of such shares, plus additional shares from silver king to pay any related taxes, provided liberty media can obtain fcc approval to do so. upon closing of the merger (prior to any conversion of liberty media's 19.9 percent retained interest), home shopping network will become an 80.1 percent subsidiary of silver king communications. original silver king shareholders (other than liberty media) will own approximately 7.4 million silver king shares, former hsn common stock shareholders (other than liberty media) will own approximately 24.5 million silver king shares and liberty media corp. will own approximately 9.8 million silver king shares (including approximately 2.1 million already owned). additionally, shareholders of savoy pictures entertainment will own approximately 4.2 million silver king shares upon completion of that transaction. silver king shares received by liberty media under the merger agreement will be subject to the terms of an existing stockholders agreement between liberty media and barry diller, pursuant to which mr. silver king and hsn agree to merge page 5 of 5 diller, through bdtv inc., exercise general voting control of these securities subject to certain extraordinary matters. home shopping network pioneered the television shopping industry in 1982. its 24 hour programming reaches approximately 69 million households via cable and broadcast station affiliates and satellite dish receivers. silver king communications, the nation's sixth largest television station group, owns and operates 12 independent full-power uhf broadcast stations in 11 major markets, reaching approximately 29 million television households. the stations serve 10 of the 16 largest markets in the united states, including new york, los angeles, chicago and philadelphia. silver king also owns minority interests, ranging from 33-49 percent, in seven major market stations which reach an additional 10 million u.s. television households. contacts: silver king communications, inc.: jason

inc., a delaware corporation ("parent"), house acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("sub"), home shopping network, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), and liberty hsn, inc., a colorado corporation ("liberty hsn"). recitals: a. the boards of directors of parent, sub and the company and the special committee of the board of directors of the company have each approved the terms and conditions of the business combination between parent and the company to be effected by the merger (the "merger") of sub with and into the company, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement and the general corporation law of the state of delaware (the "delaware statute"), and each deems the merger advisable and in the best interests of each corporation. b. each of parent, sub and the company desires to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the merger. c. concurrently with the execution of this agreement and as an inducement to parent to enter into this agreement, each of the persons listed on annex a has entered into a voting agreement (the "company voting agreement") pursuant to which such person has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares of company stock (as defined in section 2.1(d)) in favor of this agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by this agreement. d. concurrently with the execution of this agreement and as an inducement to the company to enter into this agreement, each of the persons listed on annex b has entered into a voting agreement (the "parent voting agreement") pursuant to which such person has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares, or to cause bdtv inc., a delaware corporation and the holder of parent stock ("bdtv"), to vote shares that are beneficially or of record owned by such person and are held by bdtv, of parent stock (as defined in section 2.1(d)), in favor of the issuance of parent stock in connection with the merger and any other matter which requires its vote in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement. e. for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the issuance of parent stock pursuant to the contingent right (as defined in section 2.1(d))) and by the exchange agreement (as defined in section 3.4) qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of section 368(a) of the united states internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). now,

(b) exchange procedures. as soon as practicable after the effective ------------------- time, parent shall instruct the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record (other than the company, parent, sub and any wholly owned subsidiary of the company) of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the effective time represented issued and outstanding shares of company common stock (collectively, the "certificates") whose shares were converted into the right to receive parent common stock or parent class b common stock pursuant to section 2.1(c) of this agreement, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as parent and the company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for certificates representing parent stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent stock or parent -5- class b common stock. upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the exchange agent, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of parent stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this article 2 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent stock, and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. in the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of company common stock which is not registered on the transfer records of the company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of parent stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent stock may be issued and paid to a transferee if the certificate representing such company stock is presented to the exchange agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. until surrendered as contemplated by this section 2.2, each certificate shall be deemed, on and after the effective time, to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of parent common stock or parent class b common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of parent stock as contemplated by this article 2 and the delaware statute. the consideration to be issued in the merger will be delivered by the exchange agent as promptly as practicable following surrender of a certificate and any other required documents. no interest will be payable on such consideration regardless of any delay in making payments. (c) distributions with respect to unsurrendered certificates. no -------------------------------------------------------- dividends or other distributions declared or made after the effective time with respect to parent common stock with a record date after the effective time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate with respect to the shares of parent common stock or parent class b common stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to section 2.2(e) until the holder of record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate. subject to the effect, if any, of applicable laws, following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of parent common stock or parent class b common stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of parent stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions on parent common stock or parent class b common stock with a record date after the effective time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of parent stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions on parent common stock or parent class b common stock with a record date after the effective time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of parent stock. (d) no further ownership rights in company common stock. all shares --------------------------------------------------- of parent common stock or parent class b common stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of company common stock or company class b common stock in accordance with the terms of this article 2 (plus any cash paid pursuant to section 2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of company common stock or company class b common stock. from and after the effective time, the stock transfer books of the company shall be closed with respect to the shares of company common stock or company class b common stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the company or the surviving corporation of the shares of company common stock which -6- were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, certificates are presented to the surviving corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this article 2. (e) no issuance of fractional shares. -------------------------------- (i) no certificates or scrip for fractional shares of parent stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of parent. (ii) as promptly as practicable following the effective time, the exchange agent shall determine the excess of (a) the number of full shares of parent common stock delivered to the exchange agent by parent pursuant to section 2.2(a) over (b) the aggregate number of full shares of parent common stock to be distributed to holders of company common stock pursuant to section 2.2(b) (such excess being herein called the "excess shares"). as soon after the effective time as practicable, the exchange agent, as agent for the holders of company common stock, shall sell the excess shares at then prevailing prices in the over-the-counter market, all in the manner provided in clause (iii) of this section 2.2(e). a fractional share of parent class b common stock shall be deemed to have the same value as the same fractional share of parent common stock. to the extent that a fractional share of parent class b common stock would otherwise be issued in the merger, the company shall pay directly to such holder of company class b common stock the amount of cash, if any, in lieu of any fractional share interests and subject to clause (v) of this section 2.2(e). (iii) the sale of the excess shares by the exchange agent shall be executed in the over-the-counter market through one or more member firms of the national association of securities dealers, inc. (the "nasd") and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of company common stock, the exchange agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of company common stock (the "common shares trust"). parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the exchange agent incurred in connection with such sale of the excess shares. the exchange agent shall determine the portion of the common shares trust to which each holder of company common stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the common shares trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of company common stock is entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of company common stock are entitled. (iv) as soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to the holders of company common stock in lieu of any fractional share interests and subject to clause (v) of this section 2.2(e), the exchange agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of company common stock. -7- (v) parent or the exchange agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of shares of company common stock such amounts as parent or the exchange agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. to the extent that amounts are so withheld by parent or the exchange agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of company common stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by parent or the exchange agent. (f) termination of exchange fund. any portion of the exchange fund ---------------------------- and common shares trust which remains undistributed to the stockholders of the company for twelve months after the effective time shall be delivered to parent, upon demand, and any former stockholders of the company who have not theretofore complied with this article 2 shall thereafter look only to parent for payment of their claim for parent common stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to parent common stock. (g) no liability. neither the exchange agent, parent, sub nor the ------------ company shall be liable to any holder of shares of company stock or parent stock, as the case may be, for shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the exchange fund or cash from the common shares trust delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (h) lost, stolen or destroyed certificates. in the event any -------------------------------------- certificates evidencing shares of company stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s) shall execute an affidavit of that fact upon request. the holder of any such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s) shall also deliver a reasonable indemnity against any claim that may be made against parent or the exchange agent with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. the affidavit and any indemnity which may be required hereunder shall be delivered to the exchange agent, who shall be responsible for making payment for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s). section 2.3. stock options. at the effective time, the company's ------------- obligation with respect to each outstanding option (each, a "company option") to purchase shares of company common stock issued pursuant to the 1996 stock option plan for employees, the 1996 stock option plan for outside directors, the 1986 stock option plan for employees and the 1986 stock option plan for directors (collectively, the "company option plans"), as amended in the manner described in the following sentence, shall be assumed by parent. the company options so assumed by parent shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the company option plans and the agreements pursuant to which such company options were issued as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, which plans and agreements shall be assumed by parent, except that (in accordance with the applicable provisions of such plans) (a) each such company option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of parent common stock equal to the product of that number of shares of company common stock covered by such company option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by the common stock exchange ratio and rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of parent common stock, and (b) the exercise price per share of parent common stock shall -8- equal the exercise price per share of company common stock in effect immediately prior to the effective time divided by the common stock exchange ratio. parent shall (i) reserve for issuance the number of shares of parent common stock that will become issuable upon the exercise of such company options pursuant to this section 2.3 and (ii) promptly after the effective time issue to each holder of an outstanding company stock option a document evidencing the assumption by parent of the company's obligations with respect thereto under this section 2.3. section 2.4. taking of necessary action; further action. if, at any ------------------------------------------ time after the effective time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this agreement or to vest, perfect or confirm

--------------------------------------- of contingent parent shares to liberty hsn, inc. ------------------------------------------------ the following provisions set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which, as part of the consideration to be received by liberty hsn in the merger in respect of its shares of company class b common stock, parent will issue to liberty hsn, from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events (or as circumstances otherwise permit), additional shares of parent class b common stock in satisfaction of parent's obligation to issue to liberty hsn (or a wholly owned subsidiary thereof to which the contingent right has been assigned) the shares of parent class b common stock which are not issued to it at the time of the merger (such shares, the "contingent parent shares"). capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the merger and exchange agreement to which this exhibit a is attached (the "agreement"). number of contingent parent shares: 2,644,299 shares of parent class b common stock, less any additional shares of parent class b common stock issued at the effective time of the merger, in accordance with any adjustments required pursuant to section 2.1(f) of the agreement, but subject to increase in connection with the issuance of extra shares (as defined below). parent obligation: upon the occurrence of, or in the event of the existence of circumstances constituting, at any time subsequent to the effective time and on or before the fifth anniversary of the effective time, a contingent issuance event (as defined below), parent shall issue to liberty hsn a number of contingent parent shares (such additional contingent parent shares, the "additional shares") equal to the available share amount (as defined below) determined at such time of, and after giving effect to, the occurrence or existence of such contingent issuance event (and any share issuances resulting therefrom). parent shall issue any additional shares to liberty hsn simultaneously with or immediately following the occurrence of a contingent issuance event; subject, ------- however, to (i) the receipt of any and all ------- consents, approvals or authorizations of any governmental or regulatory entities, and the expiration or termination of any waiting periods under the hsr act required in connection with the issuance of such additional shares, and (ii) such issuance not being taxable to liberty hsn; provided, however, that the -------- ------- condition to issuance of the contingent parent shares set forth in this clause (ii) shall be deemed satisfied to the extent that (x) the taxability of such issuance to liberty hsn is a result of (1) any action or inaction by liberty hsn or a member of the liberty group (other than due to an action or inaction specifically contemplated or required by the agreement, the exchange agreement, the term sheet or the august agreement (as defined in the term sheet)) or (2) the nature of the contingent right under laws and regulations in effect at the effective time, or (y) the taxes applicable to such issuance would have accrued or been payable by liberty hsn had all of the contingent parent shares been issued to liberty hsn in the merger at the effective time. each of parent and liberty hsn shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any such required consent or approval, and to file and cause the expiration or termination of any waiting period required in accordance with the hsr act, in each case as promptly as practicable. at or after the effective time, liberty hsn shall have the right to assign the contingent right, in whole or in part, to one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of liberty hsn; and following such assignment the term "liberty hsn" shall for purposes of the contingent right be deemed to refer to such assignee. contingent issuance event: the term "contingent issuance event" shall mean any event, including without limitation, any transaction, stock issuance, change in law, rule, or regulation, order, decree or policy and/or the existence or change in any other circumstance(s), which results in liberty hsn being permitted under applicable fcc regulations to own (without limitation or restriction relating to the continuation of such ownership following issuance, or the imposition of any restriction or limitation of the type referred to in clause (i) of the first sentence of the last paragraph opposite the caption "parent covenants" or any requirement to dispose or divest of any parent securities (including any interest in bdtv, bdtv ii or any bdtv entity (as defined in the term sheet)) or other assets or businesses in connection with such contingent issuance event (any of the foregoing restrictions or limitations, a "restrictive condition")) directly or indirectly, a greater number of equity securities of parent, including any securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into equity securities of parent (collectively, the "parent securities"), than the adjusted base 2 amount (as defined below) as of the date of the occurrence or first existence of such contingent issuance event; provided, however, that a sale or other -------- ------- disposition by the liberty group of parent securities or exchange securities (as defined in exhibit c to the agreement) shall not constitute or result in the occurrence of a contingent issuance event and such securities shall not be considered in determining the number of parent securities issuable in connection with a subsequent contingency event. the "base amount" shall be an amount equal to the number of parent securities owned, directly or indirectly, by the liberty group immediately prior to the merger (including the 2 million shares of parent class b common stock held by bdtv) together with all parent securities actually issued to liberty hsn in the merger (including any parent stock issued pursuant to the adjustment contemplated by section 2.1(f) of the merger agreement, but excluding any contingent parent shares or any parent securities issuable pursuant to the exchange agreement). the "adjusted base amount" shall be the base amount plus the number of contingent parent shares issued to liberty hsn subsequent to the merger and prior to such contingent issuance event by parent. for purposes of this exhibit a, liberty hsn shall be deemed to be entitled to own additional shares indirectly to the extent that liberty hsn would, following its receipt of such additional shares, be entitled to contribute such shares to a bdtv entity on a tax free basis. the term contingent issuance event would include, but would not be limited to, the occurrence of one of the following events, or the existence of any of the following circumstances: (i) a change in law (as defined in the term sheet) (including, but not limited to, as a result of any change in fcc regulations or a restructuring transaction (as defined in the term sheet) but not including any change in law resulting from any transaction as a result of which either liberty or liberty hsn is no longer a direct or indirect subsidiary of tci); (ii) the effectiveness of any amendment to or modification of, or supplement to, the fcc orders released march 11, 1996 and june 14, 1996 relating to the transfer of control of parent (the "fcc orders"), or any subsequent order or 3 ruling of the fcc (or any interpretation by the fcc) having the effect of superceding or modifying the fcc orders, or any waiver of the restriction or limit on the liberty group's ownership of equity securities of parent granted by the fcc, in each case which has the effect of increasing the aggregate percentage equity interest in parent or the number of parent securities which the members of the liberty group are entitled to own (directly or indirectly); provided, however, that any of foregoing which contains a restrictive condition shall not constitute or qualify as a contingent issuance event; (iii) the issuance of additional parent securities to any person or entity (including, but not limited to, upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of any options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights to acquire equity securities of parent, but excluding parent securities issued to a member of the liberty group upon the exchange of exchange securities pursuant to the exchange agreement), other than issuances resulting from stock splits, stock dividends and similar events which do not result in a change in the liberty group's proportionate equity interest in parent; or (iv) any merger, consolidation, binding share exchange (or other similar transaction) involving parent or any tender or exchange offer for the outstanding parent securities (but only to the extent that liberty hsn would be permitted under fcc regulations to hold directly or indirectly the securities issuable to holders of parent securities in connection with any such transaction or offer). calculation of available share amount: the number of additional shares issuable to liberty hsn upon the occurrence of a contingent issuance event shall be equal to the "available share amount," which shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula: a = (mp * os) - aba --------------- 1-mp 4 where: ----- a = the available share amount. mp = 21.37% or such greater percentage equity interest in parent which the liberty group is then permitted to own (directly or indirectly) in accordance with fcc regulations (as amended, modified or otherwise changed to the date thereof) or any subsequent order or determination by the fcc which supersedes or modifies the fcc orders or any waiver of or exception to the prohibitions or requirements of any of the foregoing, the effect of which would be to permit the liberty group to increase its percentage equity interest in parent (including, but not limited to, after giving effect to any "control premium" or other adjustment to the percentage equity interest of the liberty group required by the fcc regulations). os = the aggregate number of shares of parent securities issued and outstanding after giving effect to any issuances of parent securities resulting in or contributing to the occurrence of the contingent issuance event, but excluding (i) the issuance of the additional shares to liberty hsn as a result of such contingent issuance event and (ii) any shares issued to a member of the liberty group (or its permitted transferee) pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement. . aba = the adjusted base amount immediately prior to the occurrence of the contingent issuance event. notwithstanding the foregoing, parent shall not be required to issue contingent parent shares to liberty hsn unless the number of additional shares then issuable (together with any contingent parent shares that have previously become issuable to liberty hsn pursuant to this exhibit a but for the application of this sentence) exceeds 5,000; provided, however, that any such -------- ------- additional shares so not required to be issued as a result of the provisions of this sentence shall accumulate until such time as the accumulated number of contingent parent shares exceeds such 5 number, at which point such accumulated number of additional shares shall be issued to liberty hsn. approved issuance: in the event that there are any remaining shares issuable (as defined below) which cannot be issued solely due to a required approval, consent or waiver from the fcc on the third anniversary of the merger, then on and after such third anniversary until such time as there are no remaining shares issuable, liberty hsn shall have the right to make application to the fcc for such consent or approval as may be necessary to permit the issuance to it of some or all of the remaining shares issuable for the purpose of the disposition of such securities by liberty hsn in an orderly manner over a specified period of time or by a date certain (such consent or approval of the fcc, the "fcc issuance approval"). liberty hsn shall be entitled to seek such fcc issuance approval from time to time following the third anniversary of the merger and to make all applicable determinations relating to the form and substance of the consent or approval sought, including, without limitation, the number of remaining shares issuable for which such consent or approval is to be sought. the right to seek the fcc issuance approval shall not limit liberty hsn's right to have contingent parent shares issued to it upon the occurrence of a contingent issuance event subsequent to such third anniversary, nor shall it limit parent's obligations regarding its efforts to cause all remaining shares issuable to be issued consistent with the terms hereof, and in this regard parent and liberty hsn agree to cooperate in good faith in order to provide for the orderly issuance of contingent parent shares and approved shares pursuant to the contingent issuance right.. parent agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to support any request or application for a fcc issuance approval made by liberty hsn . following the receipt of any fcc issuance approval parent shall, upon the request of liberty hsn and upon the date reasonably specified by liberty, issue to it up to the number of contingent parent shares for which such approval has been granted, including therein a number of shares of parent class b common stock equal to the extra share amount; subject, however, to any limitation ------- ------- contained in the fcc issuance approval as to the aggregate number of shares to be so issued. upon each issuance of contingent parent shares pursuant to a fcc issuance approval and the subsequent taxable sale of such shares, parent shall issue to 6 liberty hsn an additional number of shares (the "extra share amount," and such shares, the "extra shares") of parent class b common stock such that after such taxable sale of all contingent parent shares and extra shares so issued (collectively, the "approved shares"), liberty hsn (or its permitted assignee) would have net after-tax proceeds equal to the total fair market value of the contingent parent shares as of the date of receipt of such shares. prior to the first issuance of shares pursuant to the fcc issuance approval, parent and liberty hsn shall enter into a registration rights agreement providing to liberty hsn customary terms for the registration of the approved shares issuable, including, but not limited to, reasonable demand and piggyback registration rights, minimum amounts of shares to be offered, and other customary and reasonable provisions, in light of the number of remaining shares issuable. such agreement shall provide that liberty hsn shall have a single special demand right which shall entitle it to require parent to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to register the full amount of shares requested to be registered and shall require parent to use its best efforts to cause such registration to become effective on or as near as possible, to the date of an fcc issuance approval. parent agrees that upon the request of liberty hsn it will file a registration statement relating to the sale by liberty hsn of such approved shares (upon conversion thereof to shares of parent common stock) under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective upon the date of issuance, or to register such shares for sale pursuant to a "shelf" registration statement, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration to remain effective during the distribution period therefor. notwithstanding the above, the total number of contingent parent shares issued or shares otherwise issuable pursuant to this exhibit a cannot exceed the number of shares of parent class b common stock issued in the merger at the effective time. the previous sentence shall be applied by taking into account the effect of stock splits, recapitalizations and similar transactions. the "remaining shares issuable" as of any date shall be equal to the number of contingent parent shares issuable to liberty hsn immediately following the effective time of the merger less the number of contingent parent shares which have been issued to liberty hsn as of such date (and shall exclude any extra shares issued to it). 7 anti-dilution adjustments: the number of remaining shares issuable shall be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events involving parent including, without limitation: (i) the payment by parent of dividends (and other distributions) on outstanding shares of parent securities in cash (or other property) or shares of parent's capital stock; (ii) subdivisions or combinations of parent securities; (iii) the issuance by parent, in reclassification of its outstanding shares of parent securities, of any other shares of capital stock of parent; and (iv) the distribution by parent to the holders of parent securities of any assets, properties or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities. disputes concerning occurrence of contingent issuance events: the determination of whether or not a contingent issuance event exists or has occurred, and the determination of the number of additional shares issuable as a result thereof, shall be made in the good faith reasonable determination of parent based upon fcc regulations (as then in effect). in the event of any dispute between parent and liberty hsn with respect to the existence or occurrence of a contingent issuance event, or the determination of the number of additional shares issuable in connection therewith, such dispute may be resolved by means of the delivery to parent and liberty hsn of a written opinion addressed to each of parent and liberty hsn (which opinion shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to parent and liberty hsn and shall not be subject to material qualifications or limitations) of counsel to parent specializing in fcc matters as to the matters that are the subject of any such dispute. transferability: liberty hsn will not be permitted to assign or transfer the contingent right or its rights with respect to any remaining shares issuable, other than any such assignment or transfer to a wholly owned subsidiary of liberty hsn. parent covenants: i) parent at all times shall reserve for issuance to liberty hsn a number of shares of parent class b common stock equal to the total number of remaining shares issuable and a number of shares of parent common stock issuable upon the conversion of the parent class b common stock issuable pursuant to the contingent right. 8 ii) parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all remaining shares issuable to have been issued to liberty hsn prior to the third anniversary of the closing of the merger and in any event prior to the expiration of the contingent right. iii) parent shall not dissolve or liquidate or take any action resulting in the voluntary dissolution or liquidation of parent or initiate any proceedings relating to the voluntary bankruptcy of parent. notwithstanding any other provision of the agreement (including this exhibit a), but excluding the transactions specifically contemplated hereby and thereby, and in addition to the foregoing rights and any other rights of liberty hsn under the agreement, until such time as there are no longer any remaining shares issuable, without the consent of liberty hsn, parent will not (and will not cause or permit any of its subsidiaries to) take any action that would, or could reasonably be expected to, or fail to take any action which failure would or could reasonably be expected to, (i) make the ownership by the liberty group of the contingent right, the contingent parent shares issuable in respect thereof, or any other material assets thereof, or the creation, existence or continuation of liberty hsn's contingent right, unlawful or result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order or decree (including the fcc regulations) or impose material additional restrictions or limitations on the liberty group's full rights of ownership of the contingent parent shares or the existence or continuation of the contingent right or the ownership by the liberty group of its other material assets or the operation of its businesses (provided, that -------- for purposes of the foregoing, to the extent that a condition, restriction or limitation upon parent or the surviving corporation or their respective subsidiaries relates to or is based upon or would arise as a result of any action or the consummation of a transaction by the liberty group, such condition, restriction or limitation shall be deemed to be such a condition, restriction or limitation on the liberty group (regardless of whether it is a party to or otherwise would be legally obligated thereby) to the extent that the taking of an action or the consummation of a transaction by the liberty group would result in bdtv, parent, or any of their respective subsidiaries being in breach or violation of any law, rule, regulation, order or decree or otherwise causing such rule, 9 regulation, order or decree to terminate or expire or would otherwise result in liberty hsn's ownership of the contingent right, the contingent parent shares or any other material assets being illegal or in violation of any law, rule, regulation, order or decree) (ii) cause the creation, existence or continuation of the contingent right to be taxable to liberty hsn, (iii) cause the issuance of any of the contingent parent shares to be taxable to liberty hsn or any member of the liberty group; provided, however, that with respect to clauses -------- ------- (ii) and (iii) hereof, if (x) such creation, existence, continuation or issuance is taxable to liberty hsn as a result of (1) any action or failure to act by liberty hsn or a member of the liberty group (other than due to an action or inaction specifically contemplated or required by the agreement, the exchange agreement, the term sheet or the august agreement) or (2) the nature of the contingent right under the laws and regulations in effect at the effective time or (y) the taxes applicable to such contingent right or issuance would have accrued or been payable by liberty hsn had all of the contingent parent shares been issued to liberty hsn in the merger at the effective time, then the covenants set forth in such clause (ii) or (iii) shall not be effective or (iv) otherwise restrict, impair, limit or otherwise adversely affect liberty hsn's right or ability to receive the contingent parent shares at any time. in addition to the foregoing, so long as there are any remaining shares issuable, parent shall not (a) declare or pay any cash dividends, or make any distribution of its properties or assets to the holders of the parent securities (other than a distribution that is tax-free to the holders of parent securities), unless prior thereto, parent shall have made arrangements reasonably acceptable to liberty hsn to protect it with respect to any adverse tax consequence incurred by liberty hsn (other than its obligation to pay tax solely because of and to the extent of the holder's receipt of such dividend or distribution) resulting from the declaration and payment of such dividend or the making of such distribution, or (b)(i) merge with or into any person, or consolidate with any person, (ii) sell or transfer to another corporation or other person the property of parent as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, or (iii) engage in any statutory exchange of parent securities with another corporation or other person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition), in each case as a result of which shares of parent securities would be reclassified or converted into the right to receive stock, securities or other property (including cash) or any combination thereof, unless in 10 connection with any such transaction (and immediately prior to the consummation thereof) all remaining shares issuable are issuable (and are issued) to liberty hsn and liberty hsn would be entitled to own and exercise full rights of ownership of such parent securities following such transaction or liberty hsn would be entitled to own and exercise full rights of ownership of the stock, securities or other property receivable by a holder of the number and kind of parent securities receivable by it upon the issuance to it of such remaining shares issuable. parent shall not become a party and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to become a party to any transaction with respect to the foregoing unless the terms of the agreements relating to such transaction include obligations of the applicable parties consistent with the foregoing. if the issuance of contingent parent shares is taxable to liberty hsn as a result of a change in law after the effective time (but not due to an action or unreasonable inaction by liberty hsn or the liberty group referred to in clause (ii)(x)(1) of the second sentence under "parent obligation"), parent acknowledges and agrees that it shall be obligated to provide to liberty hsn upon each issuance of contingent parent shares, a number of additional shares sufficient on an after-tax basis to pay any such resulting tax. expiration: parent's obligation to issue contingent parent shares, remaining shares issuable or extra shares shall terminate at the close of business on the fifth anniversary of the effective time. miscellaneous: whenever it is necessary for purposes of this exhibit to determine whether an issuance of contingent parent shares is taxable or tax-free, such determination shall be made without regard to any interest imputed pursuant to section 483 of the code. 11

into between parent and liberty hsn. the merger and exchange agreement to which this exhibit c is attached (the "agreement") contemplates that the agreements contained herein will be superseded by a definitive exchange agreement which will contain provisions incorporating and expanding upon the agreements set forth herein, together with other provisions customary in the case of transactions of this type, and such other provisions as are reasonable and appropriate in the context of the transactions contemplated hereby. parent and liberty hsn shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the satisfaction of the respective conditions to the parties' obligations to consummate such transactions and the completion of such definitive agreements. capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the agreement. exchange right: in connection with the consummation of the merger, the liberty group (or any permitted transferee) shall receive 739,141 shares of surviving corporation class b common stock and 17,566,702 shares of surviving corporation common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in section 2.1(f) of the merger agreement (such shares issued to the liberty group, the "liberty surviving common" and the "liberty surviving class b", respectively, in each case including any other securities or rights for which such shares of liberty surviving common or liberty surviving class b, as the case may be, are exchanged or into which such shares are converted prior to the exchange of such shares for parent securities). "parent securities" shall mean, collectively, all equity securities of parent, including any securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into equity securities of parent. pursuant to the exchange agreement, the members of the liberty group (or any transferee) will have the right to exchange such shares of liberty surviving class b for shares of parent class b common stock and such shares of surviving corporation common stock for shares of parent common stock from time to time as provided below. the liberty group shall have the right to exchange from time to time, a number of shares of liberty surviving common or liberty surviving class b (with the holder entitled to elect the class of surviving 1 corporation stock to be so exchanged), which would result in the issuance to such holder of a number of parent securities equal to the then available parent amount. the "available parent amount" will equal the difference between (x) the maximum number of parent securities which the holder of the liberty surviving common or liberty surviving class b (collectively, the "exchange securities") would, under the fcc regulations then in effect, then be entitled to own, and (y) the number of parent securities then owned (for purposes of the fcc regulations) by such holder of exchange securities; provided, that in determining the foregoing, a -------- holder shall not be deemed to be permitted to own shares pursuant to the fcc regulations to the extent that such exchange would result in any limitation or restriction relating to the continuation of such ownership following the exchange of such exchange securities, or the imposition of any restriction or limitation of the type referred to in clause (i) of the first sentence of the last paragraph opposite the caption "parent covenants" or any requirement to dispose or divest of any parent securities (including any interest in bdtv, bdtv ii or any bdtv entity (each as defined in the term sheet)) in connection with or as a result of such exchange (any of the foregoing restrictions or limitations a "restrictive condition")). the exchange agreement will provide that (a) each share of liberty surviving common will be exchangeable into 0.45 shares of parent common stock (the "common stock exchange ratio") and (b) each share of liberty surviving class b will be exchangeable into 0.54 shares of parent class b common stock (the "class b common stock exchange ratio"), in each case, rounded down to the nearest whole number and subject to adjustment as provided herein. notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties' obligations to exchange exchange securities for parent securities shall be deferred to the extent that the number of parent securities which would then otherwise be required to be issued upon such exchange is less than 25,000; provided, however, that any such exchange securities not then required to be exchanged as a result of the provisions of this paragraph shall be exchanged at such time as such number of parent securities issuable upon the exchange of all exchange securities then required to be exchanged equals or exceeds such number, at which time, subject to the other conditions herein, the parties shall execute such exchange. conditions to exchange: the obligation of the holder of exchange securities to consummate any such exchange pursuant to the exchange agreement shall be subject to customary conditions of closing, including but not limited to, (i) the receipt of any and all consents, approvals or authorizations of any governmental or regulatory entities, and the expiration or termination of 2 any waiting periods under the hsr act required in connection with the exchange of such exchange securities, and (ii) such exchange not being taxable to liberty hsn; provided, -------- however, that the condition to exchange exchange securities ------- set forth in this clause (ii) shall be deemed satisfied to the extent that (x) the taxability of such exchange to liberty hsn is a result of (1) any action or inaction by liberty hsn or a member of the liberty group (other than due to an action or inaction specifically contemplated or required by the merger agreement, the exchange agreement, the term sheet or the august agreement (as defined in the term sheet)) or (2) the laws and regulations in effect at the effective time, or (y) the taxes applicable to such exchange would have accrued or been payable by liberty hsn had all of the exchange securities been issued to liberty hsn in the merger at the effective time. each of parent and liberty hsn shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any such required consent or approval, and to file and cause the expiration or termination of any waiting period required in accordance with the hsr act, in each case as promptly as practicable. assignment: the rights of the liberty group under the exchange agreement shall be assignable to any person acquiring exchange securities (or any interest therein (including an interest in any bdtv entity) in a transfer made pursuant to the august agreement (treating the exchange securities as though they were silver securities (as defined in the august agreement)). anti-dilution adjustments: the common stock exchange ratio and the class b common stock exchange ratio shall be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events involving parent including, without limitation: (i) the payment by parent of dividends (and other distributions) on outstanding shares of parent securities in cash or shares of parent's capital stock; (ii) subdivisions or combinations of parent securities; (iii) the issuance by parent, in reclassification of its outstanding shares of parent securities, of any other shares of capital stock of parent, and (iv) the distribution by parent to holders of parent securities of any assets, properties or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities. adjustments upon certain fundamental transactions: the exchange agreement will also provide that in the event of any merger, consolidation, statutory exchange of securities or other recapitalization or reclassification of the securities of the surviving 3 corporation, or a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the surviving corporation, the securities or other property receivable by the holder of the exchange securities in such transaction will be exchangeable for shares of parent common stock or parent class b common stock upon the same terms and conditions as such shares of liberty surviving common and liberty surviving class b (including, without limitation, any adjustments to the common stock exchange ratio and the class b common stock exchange ratio). except as provided in the next sentence, the terms of the exchange agreement shall provide that no shares of liberty surviving common or liberty surviving class b shall be exchanged with a member of the liberty group under the exchange agreement until all contingent parent shares issuable to liberty hsn pursuant to the contingent right (each as defined in exhibit a to the agreement) have been so issued. notwithstanding the foregoing, and in addition to its right to assign its rights under the exchange agreement to any permitted transferee of exchange securities (or interests therein), the exchange agreement shall also provide that any member of the liberty group shall be permitted to exchange the applicable amount of exchange securities held by it in connection with any direct or indirect transfer of parent securities issuable upon such exchange by such member of the liberty group to one or more third parties in accordance with the silver stockholders agreement (including in connection with a public offering of parent securities effected pursuant to the liberty group's demand and piggyback registration rights under the silver stockholders agreement). parent covenants: in the exchange agreement, parent shall agree that so long as any exchange securities remain outstanding it shall provide to liberty hsn quarterly and annual financial statements and reports (including a balance sheet and related income statement and the notes related thereto) prepared with respect to the surviving corporation and such additional financial and other information with respect to the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries as liberty hsn may from time to time reasonably request. notwithstanding any other provision of the exchange agreement or the agreement to the contrary (but excluding actions specifically contemplated by the exchange agreement and the agreement), and in addition to the foregoing rights and any other voting rights granted by law to the holders of the exchange securities, without the consent of liberty hsn (which consent, in the case of clauses (ii) through (v) below, will not be unreasonably withheld), parent will not (and will not cause or permit 4 any of its subsidiaries to) cause or permit the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries to take any action that would, or could reasonably be expected to, or fail to take any action which failure would or could reasonably be expected to, (i) make the ownership by the liberty group of the exchange securities or any other material assets thereof unlawful or result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order or decree (including the fcc regulations) or impose material additional restrictions or limitations on the liberty group's full rights of ownership of the exchange securities or the ownership of its other material assets or the operation of its businesses (provided, that for purposes -------- of the foregoing, to the extent that a condition, restriction or limitation upon parent or the surviving corporation or their respective subsidiaries relates to or is based upon or would arise as a result of, any action or the consummation of a transaction by the liberty group, such condition, restriction or limitation shall be deemed to be such a condition, restriction or limitation on the liberty group (regardless of whether it is a party to or otherwise would be legally obligated thereby) to the extent that the taking of an action or the consummation of a transaction by the liberty group would result in bdtv, parent, or any of their respective subsidiaries being in breach or violation of any law, rule, regulation, order or decree or otherwise causing such rule, regulation, order or decree to terminate or expire or would otherwise result in liberty hsn's ownership of the exchange securities or any other material assets being illegal or in violation of any law, rule, regulation, order or decree), (ii) cause the acquisition or ownership by the liberty group of any exchange securities (upon the exchange pursuant to section 1.1 of the agreement immediately prior to the effective time or upon any subsequent exchange or conversion of liberty surviving common or liberty surviving class b) to be taxable to such holder; (iii) cause the exchange of exchange securities for parent securities to be a taxable transaction to the holder thereof; provided, however, that with respect to clauses -------- ------- (ii) and (iii) hereof, if (x) such acquisition, ownership or exchange is taxable to liberty hsn as a result of (1) any action or failure to act by liberty hsn or a member of the liberty group (other than due to an action or inaction specifically contemplated or required by the agreement, the exchange agreement, the term sheet or the august agreement) or (2) the laws and regulations in effect at the effective time or (y) the taxes applicable to such acquisition, ownership or exchange would have accrued or been payable by liberty hsn had all of the exchange securities been issued to liberty hsn in the merger at the effective time, then the covenants set forth in such clause (ii) or (iii) shall not be effective; (iv) result in the surviving corporation being unable to pay its debts as they become due or becoming insolvent, or (v) otherwise 5 restrict, impair, limit or otherwise adversely affect the right or ability of a holder of exchange securities at any time to exercise the exchange rights under the exchange agreement. in addition to the foregoing, the exchange agreement will provide that so long as any exchange securities are outstanding, parent shall not declare or pay any cash dividends, or make any distribution of its properties or assets to the holders of parent securities (other than a distribution which is tax free to the holders of parent securities), unless prior thereto parent shall have made arrangements reasonably acceptable to the holders of the exchange securities to protect such holders with respect to any adverse tax consequence incurred by such holder (other than the obligation of such holder to pay tax solely because of the holder's receipt of such dividend or distribution) resulting from the declaration and payment of such dividend or the making of such distribution. in addition, the exchange agreement will provide that, so long as any exchange securities are outstanding, parent will not (i) merge with or into any person, or consolidate with any person, (ii) sell or transfer to another corporation or other person the property of parent as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, or (iii) engage in any statutory exchange of parent securities with another corporation or other person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition), in each case as a result of which shares of parent securities would be reclassified or converted into the right to receive stock, securities or other property (including cash) or any combination thereof, unless in connection with any such transaction (and immediately prior to the consummation thereof) the holder of the exchange securities would be entitled to exchange all exchange securities for parent securities (and own and exercise full rights of ownership of such parent securities following such transaction) or the holder of such exchange securities would be entitled to own and exercise full rights of ownership of the stock, securities or other property receivable by a holder of the number and kind of parent securities receivable by such holder upon such exchange of exchange securities. parent shall not become a party and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to become a party to any transaction with respect to the foregoing unless the terms of the agreements relating to such transaction include obligations of the applicable parties consistent with the foregoing. 6 transfer of surviving corporation's assets and liabilities to subsidiary: parent agrees that as soon as reasonably practicable following the merger, it will use its reasonable best efforts to take and cause any of its subsidiaries to take any actions necessary in order to assign to a wholly owned subsidiary of the surviving corporation ("surviving sub") all of the material assets (other than the capital stock of surviving sub) and material liabilities of the surviving corporation and to cause surviving sub to assume or guarantee all such material liabilities and to obtain the release of the surviving corporation from all such material liabilities. following such transfer, parent shall not permit the surviving corporation to own any assets other than the capital stock of the surviving sub, and shall not permit the surviving corporation to be or become subject to any material liabilities. certain obligations upon insolvency or bankruptcy of surviving corporation: in the event that the surviving corporation should become insolvent or, within the meaning of any federal or state bankruptcy law, commence a voluntary case or consent to the entry of any order of relief or for the appointment of any custodian for its property or a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree for relief against the surviving corporation appointing a custodian or ordering its liquidation, and liberty hsn determines in good faith that the equity of the surviving corporation is reasonably likely to be impaired or extinguished, then upon the request of liberty hsn, its rights under the exchange agreement shall be converted into the deferred right to receive from parent the number of shares of parent common stock and parent class b common stock which liberty hsn would then have had the right to acquire upon the exchange of all exchange securities then outstanding (such deferred right, the "additional contingent right"). the terms and conditions of the additional contingent right shall be identical to those of the contingent right, except that the remaining shares issuable (as defined in exhibit a to the agreement) pursuant to the additional contingent right shall automatically become issuable, subject to regulatory approval, on the fifth anniversary of the date the additional contingent right is granted. 7 in connection with the grant of the additional contingent right, parent shall thereafter be obligated to use all reasonable efforts to consummate a restructuring transaction (as defined below) on or before the third anniversary of the date of the grant of the additional contingent right. in the event that such restructuring transaction has not been consummated by such fifth anniversary and the additional contingent right has not been satisfied in full by such date, parent shall thereafter be required to use its best efforts to cause all parent securities issuable in respect of the additional contingent right to be issued prior to the seventh anniversary thereof. such efforts shall include, without limitation (but subject to applicable fiduciary obligations) engaging in a restructuring transaction, completing an equity offering, or other corporate restructuring or causing all of the equity interests in parent to be acquired by a third party in a transaction which is tax free to the stockholders of parent, in any case which would result in all contingent parent shares issuable to liberty hsn pursuant to the additional contingent right being issued to it and liberty hsn being entitled to hold such parent securities or other properties receivable by it in such transaction free of any governmental or regulatory restrictions and to exercise full rights of ownership with respect thereto. a "restructuring transaction" is a transaction pursuant to which parent shall take such actions as may be reasonably necessary, including, but not limited to, to file any required applications with the fcc and any other governmental or regulatory agency, to obtain any required fcc or other governmental or regulatory consents and approvals, and to undertake any restructuring of parent's assets, liabilities and businesses, in order that liberty or liberty hsn, as the case may be, would (subject to its obligations under the august agreement, the term sheet and the silver stockholders agreement) be permitted to exercise full ownership rights (including voting rights) with respect to the parent securities owned by it (including its pro rata interest in any parent securities held by bdtv, bdtv ii or a bdtv entity). miscellaneous: if the exchange of exchange securities is taxable to liberty hsn as a result of a change in law (but not due to an action or unreasonable inaction by liberty hsn or a member of the liberty group referred to in clause (ii)(x)(1) of the first sentence of "conditions to exchange") after the effective time, parent acknowledges and agrees that it shall be obligated to provide to liberty hsn upon each exchange of exchange securities, a number of additional shares sufficient on an after-tax basis to pay any such resulting tax. 8 whenever it is necessary for purposes of this exhibit to determine whether an exchange is taxable or tax-free, such determination shall be made without regard to any interest imputed pursuant to section 483 of the code. parent at all times shall reserve for issuance to liberty hsn a number of shares of parent class b common stock and parent common stock equal to the number of shares issuable upon exchange of the remaining shares of liberty surviving class b and liberty surviving common, respectively, and shall reserve an additional number of shares of parent common stock equal to the number of shares issuable upon the conversion of shares of parent class b common stock issuable pursuant to the exchange agreement. the exchange agreement will provide that parent will grant to the holder of parent securities issuable upon the exchange of exchange securities certain rights relating to the registration of such securities under the securities act upon customary terms and conditions, including demand and piggyback registration rights. 9 annex a company stockholders party to company voting agreement

("silver"). capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the august agreement. the obligations of the parties contained herein are subject to the receipt of any required approvals of the boards of directors of silver and/or home shopping network, inc. ("hsn"), for purposes of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law. 1. hsn merger agreement. -------------------- (a) simultaneous with the execution of this agreement, a newly formed direct wholly owned subsidiary of silver ("silver sub"), hsn and liberty hsn, inc. ("liberty hsn") are entering into the merger agreement attached to this agreement as exhibit a (such agreement, including the schedules and exhibits thereto, the "merger agreement"). the merger agreement provides among other things that silver sub will merge with and into hsn (the "merger"), with the result that hsn, as the surviving corporation in the merger (the "surviving corporation"), would become a subsidiary of silver. silver sub shall have an equity capital structure identical to that of hsn prior to the merger, in that the shares of silver sub common stock ("silver sub common") will have the same rights, designations and preferences as the common stock of hsn (the "hsn common stock") and the silver sub class b common stock ("silver sub class b") will have the same rights, designations and preferences as the class b common stock of hsn (the "hsn class b common stock"). in the merger: (i) each outstanding share of hsn common stock (other than shares held by silver sub) would be converted into the right to receive 0.45 of a share of silver common stock (the "common exchange ratio"). (ii) the 19,260,859 shares of hsn class b common stock held by liberty hsn (the liberty initial class b shares"), following the exchange referred to in clause (iii) below, would be converted into the right of liberty hsn, as the holder of the liberty initial class b shares as of the time of the merger (or any wholly owned subsidiary of liberty hsn to which the contingent right (as defined below) is assigned), to receive an aggregate of 10,400,863 shares of silver class b stock (such number, the "aggregate class b amount") (which number shall be subject to adjustment immediately prior to the merger in accordance with section 2(f) of the merger agreement) plus cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in the merger agreement. at the effective time (as defined in the merger agreement) of the merger, 7,756,564 shares of silver class b common stock shall be issued to liberty hsn (the "initial merger class b amount"). immediately following the effective time, silver will be obligated to issue to liberty hsn (or any wholly owned subsidiary to which it has assigned the contingent right) an aggregate of 2,644,299 shares of silver class b common stock (such amount, the "initial contingent class b amount") upon the occurrence of certain contingencies set forth in exhibit a to the merger agreement, together with such additional number of shares of silver class b common stock as may be required in order to fulfill its obligation with respect to the issuance of extra shares (as defined in exhibit a to the merger agreement) in such exhibit a. liberty hsn's right following the merger to receive shares of silver class b common stock in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in exhibit a to the merger agreement is hereinafter referred to as the "contingent right," and the shares issuable to it upon the satisfaction of the contingencies set forth in exhibit a to the merger agreement are hereinafter referred to as the "contingent silver shares." (iii) the merger agreement provides that (a) immediately prior to, but conditioned upon the consummation of the merger, liberty hsn will exchange (the "merger exchange") (1) the 17,566,702 shares of hsn common stock held by the liberty stockholder group (the "liberty hsn common shares") for an equal number of shares of silver sub common and (2) the 739,141 shares of hsn class b common stock 2 held by the liberty stockholder group (the "liberty hsn b shares") for an equal number of shares of silver sub class b (with the result that at the time of the merger, the total number of outstanding shares of silver sub common and silver sub class b shall be equal to the number of outstanding shares of hsn common stock and hsn class b common stock immediately prior to the merger, with silver owning a number of shares of silver sub common and silver sub class b equal to the number of shares of hsn common stock not held by the liberty stockholder group and the number of liberty initial class b shares, respectively, and liberty hsn owning all other outstanding equity securities of silver sub (and silver sub shall have no other outstanding securities)), and (b) in the merger, each outstanding share of silver sub common shall be converted into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation ("surviving common") and each outstanding share of silver sub class b shall be converted into one share of class b common stock of the surviving corporation ("surviving class b stock"), with the shares of surviving common and surviving class b stock having the same rights, designations and preferences as the silver sub common stock and silver sub class b, respectively. (iv) to the extent that at the time of the merger exchange and the merger the liberty stockholder group would be permitted in accordance with the fcc regulations (as defined below) (and taking into account the silver securities then beneficially owned by it) to own, directly or, through a bdtv entity (as defined below), indirectly, a greater number of shares of silver than the initial merger class b amount, then such number of additional silver securities shall also become issuable to the liberty stockholder group upon consummation of the merger (such shares, the "additional merger shares"). the additional merger shares shall be issued to the liberty stockholder group in the merger and upon issuance, shall be applied first to reduce the initial contingent class b amount on a share for share basis until such time as the initial contingent class b amount is equal to zero (and, in the event the initial contingent class b amount is reduced to zero through the issuance of additional merger shares, silver's obligation to issue contingent silver shares in connection with the contingent right shall be terminated). in the event that the initial contingent class b amount is reduced to zero and there remain additional merger shares issuable at the time of the merger, such remaining additional merger shares shall be issued to the liberty stockholder group and upon issuance shall be applied to 3 reduce on a share for share basis (a) first, to the obligation of liberty hsn and silver sub to exchange the liberty hsn b shares for shares of silver sub class b and (b) then, to the extent that there are any remaining additional merger shares to be issued, to the obligation of liberty hsn and silver sub to exchange liberty hsn common shares for shares of silver sub common, with the result that the liberty hsn class b shares and liberty hsn common shares not so exchanged would be converted into silver class b stock and silver common stock, respectively, in the merger, and the respective obligations of the parties referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) above would be adjusted to reflect the issuance of such additional merger shares. (v) subject to the condition that the contribution thereto would be tax free, all additional merger shares would be issued to the liberty stockholder group and contributed to a bdtv entity in connection with the merger. as used herein, the term "bdtv entity" shall mean any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business association having a capital structure and governance rights substantially similar to that of bdtv, inc. ("bdtv", which is the corporation referred to as "silver company" in the august agreement), except that (i) for purposes of determining whether liberty is permitted to transfer the silver securities held by any such bdtv entity, such bdtv entity shall be deemed to be a member of the liberty stockholder group and the restrictions on transfers of interests in the silver company set forth opposite the caption "i. silver company arrangements -- transfers of interests" in the august agreement shall not be applicable to liberty (subject, however, to the other restrictions on transfer of silver securities set forth herein and in the august agreement, including the right of first refusal) and (ii) in connection with any proposed sale by liberty hsn of the silver securities held by such bdtv entity (or its equity interest in such bdtv entity), liberty shall be entitled to purchase diller's entire interest in such bdtv entity for an amount in cash equal to the dodgers interest purchase price or, at its election, require diller to sell its interest in such bdtv entity to any such transferee for a pro rata portion of the consideration to be paid by the applicable transferee in such transaction; provided, however, that the term -------- ------- "bdtv entity" shall not be deemed to include bdtv or bdtv ii (as defined below). the term "fcc regulations" shall mean, collectively, all federal communications statutes, and all rules, regulations, orders, decrees and policies (including the fcc's 4 memorandum opinion and order released march 11, 1996 (the "fcc march order") and its memorandum opinion and order released june 14, 1996 (the "fcc june order", and together with the fcc march order, the "fcc orders")) of the fcc, and any interpretations or waivers thereof or modifications thereto. (vi) if as a result of any issuance of contingent silver shares to liberty hsn, liberty hsn would otherwise own shares of silver class b common stock (other than any such shares held by bdtv or bdtv ii or, to the extent liberty hsn is not deemed to have an "attributable interest" therein, a bdtv entity) which would represent an "attributable interest" in silver under applicable fcc regulations), (i) liberty hsn would contribute to a bdtv entity all such contingent silver shares in exchange for non-voting equity securities of such bdtv entity (in an amount based on the market price of the silver common stock as of the date of such contribution) and (ii) diller would contribute to such bdtv entity a number of whole shares of silver common stock equal to (a) $100, divided by (b) the market price of the silver common stock as of the date of such contribution, rounded up to the nearest whole number; provided, that (i) for purposes of determining whether liberty is permitted to transfer the silver securities held by such bdtv entity, such bdtv entity shall be deemed to be a member of the liberty stockholder group and the restrictions on transfers of interests in bdtv set forth in the august agreement shall not apply to liberty (subject, however, to the other restrictions on transfer of silver securities set forth herein and in the august agreement, including the right of first refusal) and (ii) in connection with any proposed sale by liberty hsn of the silver securities held by such bdtv entity (or its equity interest in such bdtv entity), liberty shall be entitled to purchase diller's entire interest in such bdtv entity for an amount in cash equal to the dodgers interest purchase price or, at its election, require diller to sell its interest in such bdtv entity to any such transferee for a pro rata portion of the consideration to be paid by the applicable transferee in such transaction. (b) consummation of the merger will also be conditioned upon silver and liberty hsn entering into a definitive exchange agreement having the terms and conditions set forth in exhibit c to the merger agreement (the "exchange agreement"), and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the parties to the merger agreement, pursuant to which the liberty stockholder group (or any transferee permitted under the august 5 agreement, treating the exchange securities (as defined in exhibit c to the merger agreement) as though they were silver securities) would have the right to exchange from time to time a number of shares of surviving common or surviving class b stock (with the holder entitled to elect the class of surviving corporation stock to be so exchanged) received by the liberty stockholder group in connection with the merger (such shares issued to the liberty stockholder group, the "liberty surviving common" and the "liberty surviving class b", respectively, in each case including any other securities or rights for which such shares of liberty surviving common or liberty surviving class b, as the case may be, are exchanged or into which such shares are converted prior to the exchange of such shares for silver securities), for shares of silver common stock and silver class b stock, with each share of liberty surviving common being exchangeable into a number of shares of silver common stock equal to the common exchange ratio and each share of liberty surviving class b being exchangeable into a number of shares of silver class b stock equal to the class b exchange ratio, in each case subject to adjustment upon certain events affecting silver. in the event that a holder of exchange securities would be entitled to hold directly shares of silver class b common stock issuable upon an exchange of shares of liberty surviving class b but for the limitations imposed by the fcc regulations relating to a person's aggregate voting power in silver, and if such person would, under the fcc regulations, be permitted to hold directly a number of shares of silver common stock equal to the number of shares of silver class b stock so issuable, then in connection with such exchange, such holder will be required to offer to exchange such shares of silver class b stock so receivable by it for silver common stock owned by the diller stockholder group and, if diller does not accept such offer to exchange, or if such exchange with the diller stockholder group cannot be accomplished on a tax-free basis (and the exchange of such exchange securities for silver securities would not otherwise be taxable), then such holder shall be entitled to exchange such exchange securities for shares of silver class b stock and thereafter convert such shares of silver class b stock into shares of silver common stock. nothing in this agreement shall obligate liberty hsn to contribute any silver securities received pursuant to the exchange agreement to a bdtv entity. (c) promptly following the merger in a transaction complying with the requirements of section 351 of the code or in an otherwise tax- free transaction, (i) liberty will contribute the initial merger class b amount of 6 shares of silver class b common stock issued to liberty at the time of the merger (other than any additional merger shares) to a corporation ("bdtv ii") having a charter and bylaws substantially equivalent to the charter and bylaws of bdtv as in effect on the date hereof (or, in the event the fcc regulations would permit such silver securities to be held by a partnership, limited liability company or other entity, such entity as the parties may mutually agree), in exchange for a number of shares of class b common stock of bdtv ii based upon the market price of the shares of silver class b stock contributed to bdtv ii by the liberty stockholder group and (ii) diller will contribute to bdtv ii a number of whole shares of silver common stock equal to (a) $100 divided by (b) the market price of the silver common stock as of the date of contribution, rounded up to the nearest whole number, in exchange for one share of class a common stock of bdtv ii. at all times following such contribution for purposes of this agreement and the august agreement the term "silver company" or "bdtv," as the case may be, shall be deemed to refer to bdtv and bdtv ii, collectively. the respective rights and obligations of liberty (and its stockholder group) and diller (and his stockholder group) with respect to each of bdtv and bdtv ii and the outstanding equity securities of both bdtv and bdtv ii shall be as provided in the august agreement with respect to "silver company", including, subject to paragraph 2(c) below, the provisions set forth in the august agreement under the caption "i. silver company arrangements--transfers of interests." 2. restructuring transaction. (a) at any time following the ------------------------- consummation of the merger that liberty or liberty hsn is no longer a subsidiary of tele-communications, inc. (and provided that a change in law has not theretofore otherwise occurred), liberty may request by written notice to diller and silver that diller use all reasonable efforts to take, and, subject to any applicable fiduciary duties of diller, as a director or officer of silver, to the stockholders of silver, use all reasonable efforts to cause silver to take, such actions as may be reasonably necessary, including, but not limited to, to file any required applications with the fcc and any other governmental or regulatory agency, to obtain any required fcc or other governmental or regulatory consents and approvals, and to undertake any restructuring of silver's assets, liabilities and businesses, in order that liberty or liberty hsn, as the case may be, would (subject to its obligations under the august agreement, this agreement and the silver stockholders agreement) be permitted to exercise full ownership rights (including voting rights) with respect to the silver securities owned by it (including its pro rata interest in any silver securities held by the silver company or a bdtv entity) (such 7 action or transaction resulting from the foregoing, a "restructuring transaction"). (b) simultaneously with or immediately following the consummation of the restructuring transaction, liberty or its designee shall be required to purchase (and diller will be required to sell) diller's entire equity interest in the silver company and each bdtv entity for an amount equal to the applicable dodgers interest purchase price. (c) if a restructuring transaction has not occurred within 365 days following the notice referred to in paragraph 2(a) (or, if earlier, such time as liberty reasonably determines, after consultation with diller, that diller has ceased to use his reasonable efforts to consummate a restructuring transaction as required by this section 2), and a change in law has not otherwise occurred by such date, then notwithstanding the restrictions on transfer of the silver securities described under the caption "transfers of silver securities" in the august agreement, the liberty stockholder group will be entitled to sell any and all of its silver securities (including its entire equity interest in the silver company or any bdtv entity, or any exchange securities or silver securities receivable pursuant to the exchange agreement, but not any direct sale of contingent silver shares issuable pursuant to the contingent right), subject only to (i) diller's right of first refusal (as defined below), (ii) liberty's obligation to exchange shares of silver class b stock so proposed to be sold for shares of silver common stock owned by the diller stockholder group pursuant to the paragraph of the august agreement entitled "share exchange" (but without regard to the limitation in the last sentence thereof), (iii) liberty's further obligation to convert shares of silver class b stock (or surviving class b stock) into shares of silver common stock (or surviving common) prior to or simultaneous with such a sale (other than to a member of the diller stockholder group), and (iv) diller's special purchase right (as defined below). such person or entity (other than a member of the diller stockholder group) shall acquire such silver securities and/or interest in the silver company or such bdtv entity free and clear of any rights or obligations under the august agreement, this agreement or the silver stockholders agreement; provided, that such person or entity shall be entitled to such reasonable demand and incidental registration rights with respect to its silver securities (including those shares represented by its interest in the silver company or a bdtv entity) as was the liberty stockholder group under the august agreement and/or the silver stockholders agreement or this agreement prior to such sale. except as specifically provided in this paragraph, the sale by the liberty stockholder group permitted herein will not otherwise alter the rights and obligations of 8 the parties set forth in the august agreement (as amended by this agreement). right of first refusal and special purchase right the term "right of first refusal" shall mean (for purposes of this agreement and for purposes of the right of first refusal referred to in the august agreement under the caption "transfers of silver securities") the right of a stockholder (which shall be assignable) to acquire all, but not less than all, of the securities proposed to be sold by the other stockholder in a transaction having terms (including (except pursuant to the special purchase right) net economic terms) and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to the selling stockholder than those of the transaction pursuant to which it intends to sell such securities. in the event that (x) a stockholder proposes to sell silver securities in a transaction in which the other stockholder would have the right to exercise its right of first refusal to purchase all, but not less than all, of such shares to be sold, and (y) after giving effect to such sale and the requirement that the selling stockholder convert all shares of silver class b stock into silver common stock upon such sale, the other stockholder group's beneficial ownership of silver securities would represent less than 50.1% of the outstanding voting power of the silver securities on a fully diluted basis, then subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, a stockholder shall have the right (the "special purchase right") to purchase from such selling stockholder such minimum number of silver securities (giving effect to the voting power thereof) as is required in order to result in the aggregate voting power of the silver securities beneficially owned or whose voting power is controlled by such stockholder group being equal to 50.1% of the voting power of the outstanding silver securities on a fully diluted basis. a stockholder's right to exercise the special purchase right shall be subject to the condition that such stockholder shall have (x) exercised all options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire silver securities as are beneficially owned by it and which are then (or will become prior to such sale) exercisable, and (y) exchanged with the other stockholder all shares of silver common stock beneficially owned by it for shares of silver class b stock owned by the other stockholder (to the extent such stockholder owns shares of silver class b stock), or in each case, made arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the other stockholder in respect of such exercise, conversion or exchange (which will occur 9 simultaneously with the purchasing stockholder's purchase from the other stockholder). the purchase price for silver securities in connection with the exercise of the special purchase right or the right of first refusal shall be equal to the price per share of silver securities to be paid to the selling stockholder in the proposed transaction (as it may be adjusted in order to determine the net economic value thereof other than in the case of the special purchase right). in the event that the consideration payable to a stockholder in a proposed transaction consists of securities, the purchase price per share shall equal the fair market value of such securities divided by the number of shares of silver securities to be sold. such fair market value shall be the market price of any publicly traded security and, if such security is not publicly traded, the fair market value shall equal the appraised value. a stockholder (or its assignee) shall pay such purchase price in cash or by the delivery of marketable securities having an aggregate fair market value equal to such purchase price; provided that if the securities to be so -------- delivered by a stockholder (or its assignee) would not, in the other stockholder's possession, have at least the same general degree of liquidity as the securities the other stockholder was to receive in such proposed transaction (determined by reference to the other stockholder's ability to dispose of such securities (including, without limitation, the trading volume of such securities and the other stockholder's percentage ownership of the issuer of such securities)), then the purchasing stockholder shall be required to deliver securities having an appraised value equal to such purchase price. in the event the purchasing stockholder delivers securities in payment of such purchase price, the purchasing stockholder agrees to provide the other stockholder with registration rights related thereto (if, in the other transaction, the selling stockholder would have received registered securities or registration rights). each stockholder agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve to the other stockholder, to the extent possible (except in the case of a right of first refusal where it is a condition thereto that such tax benefits be included in determining the net economic value of an offer pursuant to such right), the tax benefits available to it in such proposed transaction, and to otherwise seek to structure such transaction in the most tax efficient method available. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the purchasing stockholder pays the purchase price for silver securities purchased pursuant to the right of first refusal or the special purchase right in securities, such securities must be securities that the other stockholder is permitted to own under applicable fcc regulations. 10 notwithstanding anything herein or in the august agreement, liberty hsn's sale on or after the third anniversary of the merger of the approved shares (as defined in exhibit a to the merger agreement) in an offering of silver common stock registered under the securities act shall not be subject to the right of first refusal, the special purchase right and diller's right to exchange silver common stock for shares of silver class b stock, unless and to the extent such rights can be exercised without impairing liberty's economic benefit therefrom or delaying any transaction relating to the approved shares. subject to the foregoing, liberty agrees to cooperate in good faith in the event diller seeks to exercise such rights. 3. management structure. the silver stockholders agreement shall --------------------- provide that upon the earlier to occur of (x) the restructuring transaction (which will result in a change in law following the consummation thereof) and (y) a change in law (which the parties agree shall include, for purposes of this agreement, the august agreement, the silver stockholders agreement, and the organizational documents of each of bdtv, bdtv ii and any bdtv entity, any change in law, rule or regulation, or change in the circumstances of any holder of shares of silver class b common stock (or surviving class b stock) or of an interest in the silver company (or any bdtv entity) or silver (including, but not limited to, in the case of liberty, a change in the ownership of a majority of the outstanding common stock of liberty or liberty hsn)) or any other event, the effect of which is or would be to permit liberty or any holder of liberty's interest in the silver company (or any bdtv entity) to exercise ownership rights (including voting rights) with respect to the silver securities owned by it (including its pro rata portion of any silver securities held by the silver company or any bdtv entity)), or which would otherwise result in the issuance to it of all contingent silver shares and the exchange of all exchange securities, whether before or after the merger, the management rights of the parties with respect to silver shall be as follows: (i) diller thereafter would be entitled to designate a mutually agreeable number of the members of the board of directors of silver and liberty would be entitled to designate the remainder of the directors of silver (which number designated by liberty shall, in any event, constitute a majority of the number of directors constituting the entire silver board of directors). in the event that (a) any of liberty's designees on the silver board of directors vote in a manner different than diller (or in the event that diller is required to abstain from voting under applicable law, different than diller's expressed preference) with respect to any matter voted upon by the silver board 11 of directors, and the outcome of such vote is inconsistent with diller's vote (or such preference) solely as a result of such different vote by any of such designees of liberty (except to the extent that such liberty designees are required under applicable law to abstain from voting) or (b) any member of the liberty stockholder group votes any of its silver securities with respect to any matter presented for a vote of the stockholders of silver in a manner inconsistent with the manner in which the diller stockholder group votes silver securities and the outcome of such vote is inconsistent with the manner in which diller has voted, solely as a result of such different vote by any such member of the liberty stockholder group (including, except as set forth below, decisions relating to diller's employment with silver), in either case other than (w) as specifically provided for by this agreement, the august agreement or the silver stockholders agreement (including, without limitation, a class b issuance (as defined below)), (x) any decision to terminate diller's employment with silver for cause, (y) any decision relating to diller's compensation by silver or any of its subsidiaries (except as provided for by the silver term sheet), or (z) any decision relating to a fundamental matter (any such vote contrary to diller's vote on such preference other than as provided in clauses (w) (x), (y) and (z) above, a "qualifying disagreement"), then diller shall be entitled to deliver notice of his election (a "management election") to exercise his management rights as a
