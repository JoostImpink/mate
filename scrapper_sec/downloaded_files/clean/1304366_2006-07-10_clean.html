to vote or to cause to be voted all of the shares of such shareholder that are subject thereto (i) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the company under the merger agreement; and (iii) except with the prior

price of community common stock on june 27, 2006, the last trading day prior to the execution of the definitive agreement) consisting of 75% in community common stock and 25% cash for the outstanding common stock of the company, as elected by the company&#146;s shareholders, subject to the provisions of the merger agreement. the transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction under section 368(a) of the internal revenue code, as amended. the merger agreement provides that the company&#146;s shareholders will receive $46.00 per share if the average closing price for community&#146;s stock for the 20 trading days ending three days prior to closing is valued between $28.26 and $34.54. if community&#146;s 20 day average price is below $28.26 or above $34.54, the per share value to be received by the company shareholders and the percentages of cash and stock will vary as more fully described in the merger agreement. consummation of the merger is subject to customary conditions, including among other things (i) approval of the merger by the company&#146;s and community&#146;s shareholders, and (ii) approval of regulatory authorities. in addition, the merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both the company and community and provides that, in the event the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, as more fully described therein, the company will be required to pay a termination fee equal to $4.0 million. furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the directors of the surviving corporation

(c) no conflicts . neither the execution, delivery and performance of this voting agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will conflict with or constitute a violation of or a default under (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) any contract, agreement, voting agreement, shareholders&#146; agreement, trust agreement, voting trust, proxy, power of attorney, pooling arrangement, note, mortgage, indenture, instrument, arrangement or other obligation or restriction of any kind to which the shareholder is a party or which the shareholder or the shareholder&#146;s shares are subject to or bound. 2. voting agreement and agreement not to transfer . (a) the shareholder hereby agrees to vote or caused to be voted all of the shareholder&#146;s shares (i) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the seller under the merger agreement; and (iii) except with the prior written consent of company, against the following actions (other than the merger): (a) any extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the seller; (b) any sale, lease, transfer or disposition of a material amount of the assets of the seller; (c) any change in the majority of the board of directors of the seller; (d) any material change in the present capitalization of the seller; (e) any amendment of the seller&#146;s articles of incorporation or bylaws; (f) any other change in the corporate structure, business, assets or ownership of the seller; or (g) any other action which is intended, or could reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the contemplated economic benefits to company of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. the shareholder shall not enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person prior to the termination date (as defined below) to vote or give instructions, whether before or after the termination date, in any manner inconsistent with clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence. (b) the shareholder hereby agrees not to (i) sell, transfer, convey, assign or otherwise dispose of any of his or her shares without the prior written consent of company, other than shares sold or surrendered to pay the exercise price of any seller stock options or to satisfy the seller&#146;s withholding obligations with respect to any taxes resulting from such exercise, or (ii) pledge, mortgage or otherwise encumber such shares. any permitted transferee of the shareholder&#146;s shares must become a party to this voting agreement and any purported transfer of the shareholder&#146;s shares to a person that does not become a party hereto shall be null and void ab initio . 3. cooperation . the shareholder agrees that he or she will not (directly or indirectly) initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any proposal for a competing transaction (as defined in the merger agreement) from any person. 4. shareholder capacity . the shareholder is entering this voting agreement in his or her capacity as the record or beneficial owner of the shares, and not in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the seller. nothing in this voting agreement shall be deemed in any manner to limit the discretion of any shareholder to take any action, or fail to take any action, in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the seller that (i) is permitted under the terms of the merger agreement, or (ii) may be required of the shareholder under applicable law. 5. termination . the obligations of the shareholder hereunder shall terminate upon the consummation of the merger, except that if the merger is not consummated, the obligations of the shareholder hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that if, in the event of such termination, the seller is required to pay company the termination fee pursuant to section 11.1 of the merger agreement, those obligations set forth in sections 2(a)(ii), 2(a)(iii)(g) and the last sentence of 2(a) shall survive until the termination fee is paid to company. the &#147;termination date&#148; for any particular provision hereunder shall be the date of termination of the shareholder&#146;s obligations under such provision. 6. specific performance . the shareholder acknowledges that it would be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any breach of any of its obligations under this voting agreement and that the remedy at law for any breach, or threatened breach, would likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that company shall, in addition to any other rights or remedies which it may have at law or in equity, be entitled to seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the shareholder from violating any of its obligations under this voting agreement. in connection with any action or proceeding for such equitable or injunctive relief, the shareholder hereby waives any claim or defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to have the obligations of the shareholder under this voting agreement specifically enforced against him, without the necessity of posting bond or other security, and consents to the entry of equitable or injunctive relief against the shareholder enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of this voting agreement. 7. miscellaneous . (a) definitional matters . (i) unless the context otherwise requires, &#147;person&#148; shall mean an individual, bank, corporation (including not-for-profit), joint stock company, general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, business trust, trust, association, organization or other entity of any kind or nature.
