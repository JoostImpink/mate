and (e) not do indirectly that which it may not do directly by the terms of the lock-up agreement or take any other action of any kind, directly or indirectly, which might reasonably be regarded as likely to reduce the success of, or delay or interfere with the completion of the offer. page 8 of 19 &#147;acquisition proposal&#148; means, other than the transactions contemplated by the support agreement, any offer, proposal, expression of interest, or inquiry from any person (other than the offeror or any of its affiliates) made after december 28, 2009 relating to: (a) any acquisition or sale, direct or indirect, of: (i) the assets of the issuer and/or one or more of its subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of the issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(b) the page 9 of 19 offer shall have expired or shall have been withdrawn in accordance with its terms; (c) the offeror has not complied in any material respect with any covenant contained in the lock-up agreement or if any representation or warranty of the offeror herein is untrue or incorrect in any material respect and, in each case, such non-compliance or inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to prevent the completion of the offer and is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of the date that is five business days from the date of written notice of such breach and the business day prior to the expiry date of the offer; (d) the offer has been made and the offeror has not taken up and paid for all common shares deposited under the offer when required to do so in accordance with applicable law; or (e) the support agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. any termination of a lock-up agreement by a locked-up shareholder will only be effective with respect to such locked-up shareholder. each reporting person reserves the right to change its plans and intentions at any time, as it deems appropriate. in particular, each reporting person may at any time and from time to time acquire common shares or securities convertible or exchangeable for common shares, dispose of common shares which it has acquired. any such transactions may be effected at any time and from time to time subject to any applicable limitations of the securities act of 1933, as amended. except as described herein, neither the reporting persons, nor, to the reporting persons&#146;
