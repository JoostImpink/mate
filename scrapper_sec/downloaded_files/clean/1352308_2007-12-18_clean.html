capital also agreed in the stockholder agreement not to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of or offer to dispose of its shares other than pursuant to the terms of the stockholder agreement. the stockholder agreement remains in effect until the earlier of the date on which all of h.i.g. capital&#146;s shares are transferred to the reporting person and the date of termination of the merger agreement. if the merger agreement terminates due to a failure of the offer, and an alternative acquisition proposal had been made prior to that failure, and within 12 months of that termination, h.i.g. capital sells or agrees to sell to a person or a group of affiliated persons shares that it owns that represent at least 40% of the outstanding shares, then h.i.g. capital will pay $5,282,400 to the reporting person, unless it separately had offered to sell those shares to the reporting person at that time and on certain terms, and that offer had been declined by the

or dispose (the &#147;subject shares&#148;). the subject shares represent approximately 42.6% of the 17,573,481 shares represented by the issuer in the merger agreement to be outstanding as of december 7, 2007. other than the subject shares, the reporting person does not beneficially own any shares, and, to the knowledge of the reporting person, none of the persons listed on schedule a hereto beneficially own any shares.
