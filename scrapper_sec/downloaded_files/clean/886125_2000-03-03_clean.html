entering into that certain merger agreement dated february 22, 2000 (the "merger agreement") between the parties. none of the triggering events (described in item 4 below) permitting the exercise of

either take advantage of the cashless exercise feature provided in the option agreement or fund the purchase of such option shares with working capital or through other financing sources available to alcatel at the time of exercise. 5 in consideration of alcatel entering into the merger agreement and agreeing to participate in the plan of arrangement involving the issuer, terence matthews and his associated corporations (the "shareholders") entered into a voting agreement dated february 22, 2000 (the "voting agreement") with alcatel. the option agreement and the voting agreement were entered into by alcatel in order to enhance the likelihood of a successful completion of its proposed acquisition of newbridge. item 4. purpose of transaction upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, alcatel will acquire control of the issuer in exchange for roughly $7.1 billion in alcatel american depositary shares ("adss") or shares to be issued by the issuer which are exchangeable for adss. the closing is conditioned upon, among other things, obtaining the requisite shareholder approvals, regulatory approvals and canadian court approval. pursuant to the voting agreement, the shareholders agreed, among other things, to vote or cause to be voted all of their common shares (i) in favor of the proposed transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or (ii) against any action that would impede or discourage such transactions. the shareholders shall be relieved of their obligation to vote as described in (i) of the previous sentence if certain changes in canadian tax laws were to occur. in addition, each shareholder agreed not to sell, transfer, gift, assign, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of, or grant any proxy or consent with respect to, any of his or its common shares at any time prior to the termination of the merger agreement, except that (i) up to a maximum of 1,000,000 common shares (less half of the

irrevocable option (the "option") to purchase up to 36,183,000 common shares for cdn. $50.60 per share 6 (the "option shares"). the option may be exercised by alcatel in the event the merger agreement

defined in the merger agreement) having been made prior to the newbridge shareholder meeting. in addition, alcatel may not vote any of the option shares that alcatel may acquire upon exercise of the option in favor of the proposed transaction between alcatel and the issuer or against any acquisition proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) unless the shareholders are relieved of certain of their voting obligations set forth in the voting agreement, as described above. furthermore, alcatel is limited by both the merger agreement and the option agreement to receive only $375 million as a "break-up fee" and has agreed, at alcatel's discretion: (1) to reduce the number of shares subject to the option; (2) to deliver to newbridge for cancellation option shares previously purchased upon exercise of the option; (3) to pay cash to newbridge; or (4) any combination of 1-3, so long as alcatel does not retain the benefit of more than $375 million. based on the foregoing, alcatel disclaims beneficial ownership of the 36,183,000 common shares subject to the option until such time as it purchases such option shares until such time as it purchases such option shares. the description contained in this item 4 of the transactions contemplated by the option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the option agreement which is incorporated by reference herein and is filed as exhibit 3 hereto. as part of a plan of arrangement to be approved by a canadian court to affect the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the issuer will reorganize its share capital to provide for exchangeable shares and the elimination of its preferred shares. as part of the plan of arrangement, upon the effective time of the transaction, shareholders of the issuer will exchange their existing newbridge common shares for the issuer's exchangeable shares (which will be exchangeable into alcatel adss) if requested by the shareholder, or for alcatel adss.

voting agreement, alcatel has shared voting power to vote an aggregate of 39,710,908 common shares for the limited purposes described in item 4 above, and such shares constitute approximately 22% of

hereto. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer see items 3 and 4 above for a description of the merger agreement, the voting agreement and the option agreement. except as disclosed in this statement or the documents referred to herein, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (i) between the

and any other person with respect to any securities of newbridge. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits 1. merger agreement, dated february 22, 2000. 2. voting agreement, dated february 22, 2000

(b) of any material adverse change in respect of newbridge; and (c) of any material breach by newbridge of any covenant or agreement contained in this agreement; 44 -41- (b) newbridge shall and shall cause its subsidiaries to perform all obligations required or desirable to be performed by newbridge or any of its subsidiaries under this agreement, co-operate with alcatel in connection therewith, and do all such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated in this agreement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, newbridge shall and where appropriate shall cause its subsidiaries to: (i) use all reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite approvals of the newbridge shareholders to the arrangement;

(ii) not reorganize, amalgamate or merge alcatel with any other person, nor acquire by amalgamating, merging or consolidating with, purchasing a majority of the voting securities or substantially all of the assets of or otherwise, any business or person which acquisition or other transaction would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the transactions contemplated hereby beyond the outside date; and (iii) promptly advise newbridge orally and in writing: (a) of any event occurring subsequent to the date of this agreement that would render any representation or warranty of alcatel contained in this agreement (except any such representation or warranty which speaks solely as of a date prior to the occurrence of such event), if made on or as of the date of such event or the effective date, untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; (b) of any material adverse change in respect of alcatel; and (c) of any material breach by alcatel of any covenant or agreement contained in this agreement. section 4.5 covenants regarding non-solicitation. (1) subject to section 4.6, newbridge shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative (including for greater certainty any investment banker, lawyer or accountant) or agent of newbridge or any of its subsidiaries, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement, arrangement or understanding) the initiation of any inquiries or proposals regarding an acquisition proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any acquisition proposal, (iii) approve or recommend any acquisition proposal or (iv) accept or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding related to any acquisition proposal. notwithstanding the preceding part of this section 4.5(1) and any other provision of this agreement, nothing shall prevent the board of directors of newbridge from complying with newbridge's disclosure obligations under applicable laws with regard to an acquisition proposal or from considering, participating in any discussions or negotiations, or entering 48 -45- into a confidentiality agreement and providing information pursuant to section 4.5(3) (but, subject to section 4.6, not approve, recommend, accept or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding), regarding an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal (a) in respect of which any required financing has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of directors of newbridge, acting in good faith, to be reasonably likely to be obtained, (b) that did not otherwise result from a breach of this section 4.5, and (c) which the board of directors of newbridge has determined in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and with outside counsel, is a superior proposal. newbridge shall, and shall cause the officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents of newbridge and its subsidiaries to, cease immediately all current discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal, and request the return or destruction of all confidential information provided in connection therewith. (2) newbridge shall forthwith notify alcatel, at first orally and then in writing, of any acquisition proposal and any inquiry that could lead to an acquisition proposal, or any amendments to the foregoing, or any request for non-public information relating to newbridge or any newbridge material subsidiary in connection with an acquisition proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of newbridge or any newbridge material subsidiary by any person that informs newbridge or such newbridge material subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an acquisition proposal. such notice shall include a description of the material terms and conditions of any proposal, the identity of the person making such proposal, inquiry or contact and provide such other details of the proposal, inquiry, contact, discussions or negotiations as alcatel may reasonably request. newbridge shall keep alcatel informed of the status including any change to the material terms of any such acquisition proposal or inquiry. (3) if newbridge receives a request for material non-public information from a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal and newbridge is permitted, subject to and as contemplated under the second sentence of section 4.5(1), to negotiate the terms of such acquisition proposal, then, and only in such case, the board of directors of newbridge may, subject to the execution by such person of a confidentiality agreement containing employee non-solicitation and standstill provisions substantially similar to those contained in the confidentiality agreement then in effect between newbridge and alcatel, provide such person with access to information regarding newbridge; provided, however, that the person making the acquisition proposal shall not be precluded under such 49 -46- confidentiality agreement from making the acquisition proposal (but not, except subject to section 4.6(4), any material amendment thereto) and provided further that newbridge sends a copy of any such confidentiality agreement to alcatel promptly upon its execution and alcatel is provided with a list of or copies of the information provided to such person and immediately provided with access to similar information to which such person was provided. (4) newbridge shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees and its subsidiaries and their officers, directors and employees and any financial advisors or other advisors or representatives retained by it or its subsidiaries are aware of the provisions of this section 4.5, and it shall be responsible for any breach of this section 4.5 by its and its subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents. section 4.6 notice by newbridge of superior proposal determination. (1) notwithstanding sections 4.5(1), (2) and (3), but subject to alcatel's rights under sections 6.3(3)(c) and 6.4, newbridge may accept, approve or recommend or enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of an unsolicited superior proposal if, and only if: (i) it has provided alcatel with a copy of the superior proposal document; and (ii) three business days shall have elapsed from the later of the date alcatel received written notice advising alcatel that newbridge's board of directors has resolved, subject only to compliance with this section 4.6, to accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of such superior proposal and the date alcatel received a copy of such superior proposal. any information provided by newbridge to alcatel pursuant to this section 4.6 or pursuant to section 4.5 shall constitute "information" under section 4.7(2). (2) during such three business day period, newbridge agrees that alcatel shall have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this agreement. the board of directors of newbridge will review any offer by alcatel to amend the terms of this agreement in good faith in order to determine, in its discretion in the exercise of its fiduciary duties (but without regard to any requirement for approval or further approval by alcatel's shareholders), whether alcatel's offer upon acceptance by newbridge would result in such superior proposal ceasing to be a superior proposal. if the board of directors of newbridge so determines, it will enter into an amended agreement with alcatel reflecting alcatel's amended proposal. if the board of directors of newbridge continues to believe, in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such superior proposal remains a superior proposal (without regard to 50 -47- any requirement for approval or further approval by alcatel's shareholders) and therefore rejects alcatel's amended proposal, newbridge may approve, recommend, accept or enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to the superior proposal provided that such acceptance or agreement does not obligate newbridge or any other person to seek to interfere with the completion of the arrangement or impose any "break-up", "hello" or other fees or options or rights to acquire assets or securities, or any other obligations that would survive the effective date, on newbridge or any subsidiary unless and until this agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. in addition, in such circumstances, newbridge may proceed with such approvals, consents, filings of or required by governmental entities and such other persons as newbridge shall consider appropriate in order to consummate such superior proposal, provided that such activity does not interfere with the completion of the arrangement. (3) nothing contained in this section 4.6 shall limit in any way the obligation of newbridge to convene and hold the newbridge meeting in accordance with section 2.1 of this agreement. (4) newbridge acknowledges and agrees that each successive material amendment to any acquisition proposal shall constitute a new acquisition proposal for purposes of the requirement under clause (ii) of section 4.6(1) to initiate an additional three business day notice period. section 4.7 access to information. (1) subject to section 4.7(2) and applicable laws, upon reasonable notice, newbridge shall (and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to) afford alcatel's officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives and advisors ("representatives") access, during normal business hours from the date hereof and until the earlier of the effective date or the termination of this agreement, to its and its subsidiaries' properties, books, contracts and records as well as to its management personnel, and, during such period, newbridge shall (and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to alcatel all information concerning newbridge's and its subsidiaries' businesses, properties and personnel as alcatel may reasonably request. subject to section 4.7(2) and applicable laws, upon reasonable notice, alcatel shall afford newbridge's representatives the opportunity, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours from the date hereof and until the earlier of the effective date or termination of this agreement, to speak to appropriate management personnel as newbridge may reasonably request, without materially interfering with their other responsibilities, provided that all such 51 -48- conversations shall impose upon newbridge confidentiality obligations equivalent to those applicable to alcatel under the confidentiality agreement, mutatis mutandis. (2) each of alcatel and newbridge acknowledges that certain information provided to it under section 4.7(1) above will be non-public and/or proprietary in nature (the "information") and will be subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement and section 4.7(1). for greater certainty, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement shall survive the termination of this agreement, provided that the confidentiality agreement and section 4.7(1) shall terminate at the effective time notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained therein. section 4.8 closing matters. each of alcatel and newbridge shall deliver, at the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby, such customary certificates, resolutions and other closing documents as may be required by the other party hereto, acting reasonably. section 4.9 indemnification. (1) alcatel agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of the directors or officers of newbridge or any subsidiary as provided in the articles or by-laws thereof shall survive the arrangement and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the effective time. (2) there shall be maintained in effect, for not less than six years from the effective time, to the extent obtainable on reasonable commercial terms, coverage substantially equivalent to that in effect under the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by newbridge or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, which is no less advantageous, and with no gaps or lapses in coverages with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time. alternatively, at alcatel's option, it may cause newbridge to purchase "run-off" directors' and officers' liability insurance to cover prior events during such six year period or the balance thereof. section 4.10 pooling of interests accounting. (1) alcatel shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the business combination contemplated by the arrangement to be effected in such a manner as to ensure that such business combination will be accounted for as of the effective date as a pooling of interests under french generally accepted accounting principles, and will use its reasonable best efforts to refrain from taking any actions which will prevent such accounting treatment. 52 -49- (2) alcatel represents and warrants to newbridge that the cob has approved in principle such accounting treatment for the transactions contemplated hereby, and alcatel has caused to be delivered a letter in favour of newbridge from its independent accountants confirming their view that the transactions contemplated herein may be so accounted. section 4.11 safe income. newbridge shall arrange for a "safe income tuck-in" transaction (the "tuck-in") or, if a tuck-in does not achieve the objective of crystallizing the "safe income" or results in other material adverse tax consequences to the shareholder, another form of safe income crystallisation transaction, with any shareholder having a significant "safe income" with respect to its shares of newbridge and requesting such a transaction, provided that: (a) only one form of transaction will be required and at least one shareholder must request such a transaction within ten (10) days of the date hereof; (b) such transaction is to be completed in accordance with applicable laws prior to the effective date; (c) such transaction (other than a tuck-in) must be accomplished in a manner that does not entail any material cost, expense, obligation or liability (and for this purpose $2,500,000 in the aggregate shall be deemed not to be material), or any delay in completing the arrangement, to newbridge or their respective subsidiaries or shareholders (including to newbridge's non-participating shareholders); and (d) such transaction and its terms and conditions must be satisfactory to alcatel, acting reasonably (limited to, in the case of a tuck-in, its effect on newbridge or its shareholders). in the event that such transaction or its terms and conditions are not satisfactory to alcatel, acting reasonably, or the ontario securities commission refuses to grant any relief required in connection with any such transaction, alcatel will use its reasonable best efforts, for a period not to exceed 15 business days to assist newbridge in structuring such a transaction in a manner satisfactory to alcatel, acting reasonably. the parties acknowledge that alcatel will require, without limitation, that the arrangement and related matters (after taking into account any transaction described herein) be poolable under french gaap and not objectionable to the cob or the pse, and that a tuck-in does not adversely affect these pooling and cob/pse issues. in the event that no such transaction is satisfactory to alcatel, acting reasonably, where it used its reasonable best efforts as aforesaid, this shall not affect the completion of the arrangement. 53 -50- article 5 conditions section 5.1 mutual conditions precedent. the respective obligations of the parties hereto to complete the transactions contemplated by this agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction, on or before the effective date, of the following conditions precedent, each of which may only be waived by the mutual consent of alcatel and newbridge: (a) the arrangement shall have been approved at the newbridge meeting by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast by the newbridge shareholders who are represented at the newbridge meeting; (b) the arrangement shall have been approved at the newbridge meeting in accordance with any conditions in addition to those set out in section 5.1(a) which may be imposed by the interim order; (c) the interim order and the final order shall each have been obtained in form and on terms satisfactory to each of newbridge and alcatel, acting reasonably, and shall not have been set aside or modified in a manner unacceptable to such parties, acting reasonably, on appeal or otherwise; (d) the alcatel shareholders shall have approved the alcatel resolution at the alcatel meeting by the requisite levels required by applicable laws; (e) there shall not be in force any final and non-appealable injunction, order or decree restraining or enjoining the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement and there shall be no proceeding (other than an appeal made in connection with the arrangement), of a judicial or administrative nature or otherwise, brought by a governmental entity in progress or threatened that relates to or results from the transactions contemplated by this agreement that would, if successful, result in an order or ruling that would preclude completion of the transactions contemplated by this agreement in accordance with the terms hereof or would otherwise be inconsistent with the regulatory approvals which have been obtained; (f) this agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to article 6; (g) the exchangeable shares shall have been conditionally approved for listing on the toronto stock exchange, the alcatel adrs and the 54 -51- alcatel adss to be provided upon the exchange of exchangeable shares shall have been approved for listing on the nyse, and the alcatel shares to be issued in connection with the arrangement shall have been approved for listing on the pse, subject to the filing of required documentation, notice of issuance and/or other usual requirements; (h) other than the regulatory approvals, all consents, waivers, permits, orders and approvals of any governmental entity, and the expiry of any waiting periods, in connection with, or required to permit, the consummation of the arrangement, the failure of which to obtain or the non-expiry of which would constitute a criminal offense, or would have a material adverse effect on alcatel or newbridge, as the case may be, shall have been obtained or received on terms that will not have a material adverse effect on alcatel and/or newbridge; there shall not be pending or threatened any suit, action or proceeding by any governmental entity: (i) seeking to prohibit or restrict the acquisition by alcatel or any of its subsidiaries of any newbridge common shares, seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the plan of arrangement or seeking to obtain from newbridge or alcatel any damages directly or indirectly in connection with the arrangement, (ii) seeking to prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by alcatel or any of its subsidiaries of any material portion of the business or assets of newbridge or any of its subsidiaries or to compel alcatel or any of its subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of newbridge or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of alcatel or any of its subsidiaries to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any newbridge common shares, including the right to vote the newbridge common shares purchased by them on all matters properly presented to the shareholders of newbridge, (iv) seeking to prohibit alcatel or any of its subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any material respect the business or operations of newbridge or any of its subsidiaries or (v) which otherwise is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on newbridge or alcatel; and (i) the regulatory approvals shall have been obtained or satisfied on terms and conditions satisfactory to alcatel and newbridge (but only insofar as it would directly affect newbridge shareholders), acting reasonably, and in connection therewith alcatel shall have regard to the magnitude of the transaction. 55 -52- section 5.2 additional conditions precedent to the obligations of alcatel.

(1) alcatel and newbridge will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the effective date, of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to: (a) cause any of the representations or warranties of the other party contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate on the date hereof or on the effective date; or (b) result in the failure in any material respect to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by the other hereunder prior to the effective date. (2) neither alcatel nor newbridge may seek to rely upon any conditions precedent contained in sections 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3, or exercise any termination right arising therefrom, unless forthwith and in any event prior to the filing of the articles of arrangement for acceptance by the director, alcatel or newbridge, as the case may be, has delivered a written notice to the other specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which alcatel or newbridge, as the case may be, are asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment of the applicable condition precedent or the exercise of the termination right, as the case may be. if any such notice is delivered, provided that newbridge or alcatel, as the case may be, is proceeding diligently to cure such matter, if such matter is susceptible to being cured (for greater certainty, except by way of disclosure in the case of representations and warranties), the other may not terminate this agreement as a result thereof until the later of the 30 days prior to the outside date and the expiration of a period of 30 days from such notice. if such notice has been delivered prior to the date of the newbridge meeting, such meeting shall, unless the parties agree otherwise, be postponed 58 -55- or adjourned until the expiry of such period. if such notice has been delivered prior to the making of the application for the final order or the filing of the articles of arrangement with the director, such application and such filing shall be postponed until the expiry of such period. for greater certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within the time period referred to herein without a material adverse effect on the curing party, this agreement may not be terminated as a result of the cured breach. section 5.5 satisfaction of conditions. the conditions precedent set out in sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 shall be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released when, with the agreement of alcatel and newbridge, a certificate of arrangement in respect of the arrangement is issued by the director. article 6 amendment and termination section 6.1 amendment. this agreement and the plan of arrangement may, at any time and from time to time before or after the holding of the newbridge meeting or the alcatel meeting but not later than the effective date, be amended by mutual written agreement of the parties hereto, and any such amendment may, subject to applicable laws and the interim order, without limitation: (a) change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts of the parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies or modify any representation or warranty contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; (c) waive compliance with or modify any of the covenants herein contained and waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of the parties; and/or (d) waive compliance with or modify any conditions precedent herein contained. section 6.2 mutual understanding regarding amendments. the parties agree that if alcatel or newbridge, as the case may be, propose any amendment or amendments to this agreement or to the plan of arrangement, the other will act reasonably in considering such amendment and if the other and its security holders are not prejudiced by reason of any such amendment the other will co-operate in a reasonable fashion with alcatel or 59 -56- newbridge, as the case may be, so that such amendment can be effected subject to applicable laws and the rights of the security holders. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, alcatel shall, acting reasonably, consider in good faith any proposal from newbridge made within 7 business days hereof regarding the attributes of the exchangeable shares and ancillary rights (including the outside date of their redemption and whether the holders thereof can indirectly possess any voting rights at the alcatel level or other features of the arrangement), but the decision to modify any of such attributes shall be in the sole discretion of alcatel. section 6.3 termination. (1) if any condition contained in sections 5.1 or 5.2 is not satisfied at or before the effective date to the satisfaction of alcatel, then alcatel may, subject to section 5.4 and to section 5.2(2) in the case of section 5.2, by notice to newbridge terminate this agreement and the obligations of the parties hereunder (except as otherwise herein provided, including under section 6.4), but without detracting from the rights of alcatel arising from any breach by newbridge but for which the condition would have been satisfied.
