(b) "registration expenses" and "selling expenses" shall mean the expenses so described in section 7.6. (c) "other holders" shall mean all holders of the company's securities other than holders. (d) "underwriter" shall mean each person who is or may be deemed an "underwriter," as that term is defined in section 2(11) of the securities act, in respect of securities which shall have been registered by abiomed under the securities act pursuant to any of the provisions of this article 7. 7.2. required registration. (a) at any time after the first anniversary of the date hereof and prior to the seventh anniversary of the date hereof, the holder(s) of at least 25% of the then unregistered shares may notify abiomed in writing that such holder(s) intend to offer or cause to be offered for sale unregistered shares and request abiomed to cause such shares to be registered under the securities act if such registration may be effected on form s-3 (or any similar or successor form promulgated by the sec). such right to require registration shall be available to holders on not more than a total of three (3) occasions, and on not more than one (1) occasion during any twelve (12) month period, provided such right shall be deemed to have been used only upon a registration statement on form s-3, or successor form, becoming and remaining effective in accordance with such request and the provisions hereof. (b) upon a request pursuant to section 7.2(a), abiomed will use commercially reasonable efforts as soon as practicable thereafter to prepare and file a registration statement on the appropriate form covering such shares. neither abiomed nor any other holder may include any securities in any registration statement requested pursuant to this section 7.2 which relates to an underwritten offering unless the underwriter or underwriters managing the offering shall determine and advise in writing that such inclusion will not interfere with the marketing of the securities to be offered by the requesting holder or holders. any holder or holders intending to request a registration pursuant to section 7.2(a) shall notify each other holder of such request at least thirty (30) days prior to making the request and shall permit each such other holder to join such request provided that such other holder, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notification, so indicates his or her intention in writing to the holder or holders from which such notification was received. abiomed, if requested, shall provide reasonable assistance in such notification process. if the underwriter managing such an offering shall determine that the number of shares page 20 of 33 pages 15 proposed to be included would interfere with the marketing of the same, then the number of shares proposed to be included in such registration statement shall be reduced to the extent deemed appropriate by such managing underwriter pro rata among the holders joining in such request in proportion to the number of shares then held by each, giving effect to the provisions of the last two sentences of section 7.3 below. abiomed shall have the right once per request to defer for a reasonable period (not to exceed six (6) months) the filing of any registration statement requested hereunder if, in the reasonable judgment of abiomed's board of directors, such registration would materially interfere with or materially and adversely affect the aftermarket of any recently completed public offering, or any then existing negotiations for financing arrangements of abiomed, or any material business transaction then pending or being negotiated, or any arrangement or plan of abiomed, then pending or being negotiated in good faith, relating to any acquisition, disposition, merger or similar transaction. 7.3. incidental registration. if abiomed for itself or any of its security holders shall at any time or times after the first anniversary of the date hereof and prior to the seventh anniversary of the date hereof determine to register under the securities act any shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering (other than (a) the registration of an offer and sale of securities to employees of, or other persons providing services to abiomed pursuant to an employee or similar benefit plan, registered on form s-8 or comparable form; or (b) relating to a merger, acquisition or other transaction of the type described in rule 145 under the securities act or comparable rule, registered on form s-4 or similar form), abiomed will notify each holder in each case of such determination at least twenty (20) days prior to the filing of such registration statement, and upon the request of a holder given in writing within ten (10) days after the date of such notice, abiomed will use commercially reasonable efforts as soon as practicable thereafter to cause any of the shares specified by such holder to be included in such registration statement. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter determines and advises in writing that the inclusion of all shares of such requesting holders and all shares of abiomed's common stock to be offered by abiomed and by other holders, whether covered by requests for registration or otherwise included, would interfere with the marketing of the securities to be sold by abiomed, or if the registration is at the request of a person or persons with a right to require registration, by that person or persons, then the number of shares of common stock otherwise to be included in the registration statement by holders and other holders shall be reduced as follows: (i) there shall first be excluded shares proposed to be included by other holders not possessing legal rights to include the same pursuant to this section or any similar provision; and (ii) any further reduction shall be pro rata among such holders and other holders (having such legal rights) in proportion to the number of shares as to which registration is requested by each; provided, however, that there shall be no reduction in the number of shares to be included therein (x) by abiomed or (y) if the registration is at the request of a person or persons with a right to require such registration, by that person or persons. for purposes of making any such reduction, each holder (whether a holder or other holder) which is a partnership, together with the affiliates, partners and retired partners of such holder, the estates and family members of any such partners and retired partners and of their spouses, and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing persons shall be deemed to be a single holder and any pro rata reduction with respect to such holder shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares sought to be sold by all entities and individuals so included in such holder, and the aggregate reduction so allocated to such holder shall be allocated among the entities and individuals included in such page 21 of 33 pages 16 holder in such manner as such partnership may reasonably determine. if the managing underwriter determines and advises in writing that the inclusion in the registration statement of any shares of common stock to be sold by stockholders of abiomed would interfere with the marketing of the securities to be sold by abiomed, no notice need be given to any holder pursuant to the first sentence of this section and no holder will have the right to include its shares in such registration statement. 7.4. conditions of obligations to register shares. as conditions to abiomed's obligation hereunder to cause a registration statement to be filed or shares to be included in a registration statement, the holder shall provide such information and execute such documents as may reasonably be required in connection with such registration. 7.5. registration procedures. if and whenever abiomed is required by the provisions of this article 7 to use commercially reasonable efforts to include any of the shares in a registration statement filed under the securities act, abiomed shall as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such shares and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective. (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective until the shares covered thereunder have been sold. (c) secure the designation and quotation of the shares on nasdaq or any national securities exchange on which the common stock is then listed. (d) furnish to each holder such number of copies of the prospectus contained in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents as such holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the shares owned by such holder. (e) use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares covered by such registration statement under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as each selling holder shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such holder to consummate the disposition of the shares owned by such holder in such jurisdictions during the period specified in section 7.5(b), provided that abiomed shall not be required in connection herewith to execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction. (f) notify each holder immediately of any shares covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus contained in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then page 22 of 33 pages 17 existing, and as promptly as practicable, prepare, file and furnish to the holder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or an amendment to such prospectus as may be necessary so that such prospectus does not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing; provided, however, that abiomed may delay preparing, filing and distributing any such supplement or amendment if abiomed determines in good faith that such supplement or amendment might, in the reasonable judgment of abiomed (i) interfere with or affect the negotiation or completion of a transaction that is being contemplated by abiomed (whether or not a final decision has been made to undertake such transaction) or (ii) involve initial or continuing disclosure obligations that are not in the best interests of abiomed's stockholders at such time; provided, further, that (x) abiomed will give notice (a "standstill notice") of any such delay no less than five (5) business days prior to such delay, (y) such delay shall not extend for a period of more than fifteen (15) business days without the written consent of the holder and (z) abiomed may utilize such delay no more than once in each calendar year. each holder agrees, upon receipt of a standstill notice, forthwith to cease making offers and sales of the shares pursuant to the registration statement or deliveries of the prospectus contained therein and to return to abiomed, for modification and exchange, the copies of such prospectus not theretofore delivered by such holder; provided that abiomed shall forthwith prepare and deliver to such holder after such delay a reasonable number of copies of any supplement to or amendment of such prospectus that may be necessary so that such prospectus does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing. (g) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement and, if such an order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal at the earliest possible time and to notify the holder of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof. (h) furnish to the holder and any underwriter of the holder's shares, on the date that such registration statement becomes effective, (i) an opinion, dated such date, of outside counsel representing abiomed (and reasonably acceptable to the holder) addressed to the holder as to the effectiveness of the registration statement and its compliance as to form with the requirements of the securities act and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the holder (including, if such registration statement relates to an underwritten public offering, such additional matters as are customarily included in opinions delivered by company counsel in underwritten public offerings) and (ii) in the case of an underwriting, a letter, dated such date, from abiomed's independent certified public accountants, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accounts to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the holder. (i) subject to the holder entering into a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to abiomed, provide the holder and its representatives the opportunity to conduct a reasonable inquiry of abiomed's financial and other records during normal business hours and make available its officers, directors and employees for questions regarding information which the holder may reasonably request in order to fulfill any due diligence obligation on its part. page 23 of 33 pages 18 (j) permit counsel for the holder to review such registration statement and all amendments and supplements thereto a reasonable period of time prior to the filing thereof with the sec. (k) in the event of an underwritten public offering of the shares, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form reasonably acceptable to abiomed, with the underwriters of such offering and to use its best efforts to cause the conditions to the underwriters' performance thereunder to be met. 7.6. description of expenses. all expenses incurred by abiomed in complying with any of the foregoing provisions of this section 7, including without limitation all federal and state registration, qualification and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel to abiomed, and accountants' fees and expenses incident to or required by any such registration are herein called "registration expenses." all underwriting discounts and selling commissions applicable to the sale of shares hereunder and the fees and disbursements of one counsel to the holders with respect to any registration of the shares hereunder are herein called "selling expenses." if abiomed is required by the provisions of this article 7 to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any of the shares under the securities act, the registration expenses and selling expenses in connection with such registration shall be borne as follows: (a) all registration expenses shall be borne by abiomed. (b) selling expenses shall be borne pro rata among the holders participating in the registration, except that each holder shall bear the expenses of any separate counsel retained by it. 7.7. indemnification. in the event that abiomed registers under the securities act any shares held by a holder: (a) abiomed agrees to indemnify and hold harmless such holder, each person, if any, who controls such holder within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter offering or selling the holder's shares and any person controlling such underwriter, against any and all loss, liability or expense arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in any related registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any omission or alleged omission of any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such statement or omission was (i) made in reliance upon information furnished in writing by any such holder, underwriter or controlling person specifically for inclusion therein or (ii) contained in a preliminary prospectus and corrected in a final or amended prospectus if such holder, underwriter or controlling person received notice of such final or amended prospectus prior to the effective date of the registration statement but failed to deliver a copy of the final or amended prospectus at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of the shares to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage or liability, in any case where such delivery is required by the securities act. page 24 of 33 pages 19 (b) the obligations of abiomed under sections 7.2 and 7.3 with respect to any holder are subject to the following conditions: (i) that each holder whose shares are to be included in any registration referred to in this article 7 agrees, in writing, prior to the filing of such registration or filing, to indemnify and hold harmless abiomed and each person, if any, who controls abiomed within the meaning of the securities act, against any and all loss, liability or expense arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in any related registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any omission or alleged omission of any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to statements or omissions made in reliance upon a statement in writing furnished by or on behalf of such holder for inclusion therein; provided, however, that the liability of each holder to so indemnify shall be limited to the amount received by such holder on the sale of his or her shares pursuant to such registration statement, and (ii) if such registration relates to an underwritten public offering by abiomed, that each such holder enters into an underwriting agreement in usual and standard form (including a "lock-up" not exceeding 180 days of shares not being sold in the underwritten offering) respecting such offering and uses its best reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to the underwriters' performance thereunder to be met. (c) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 7.7 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); and, provided, further, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 7.7 unless and to the extent that such failure results in the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying party. the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall pay such expense if, in the opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation and the indemnifying party shall not be required to indemnify any indemnified party for any amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in settlement of any claim or litigation without such consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonable withheld. article 8. confidentiality in connection with the due diligence investigation of abiomed by genzyme and genzyme's status as a
