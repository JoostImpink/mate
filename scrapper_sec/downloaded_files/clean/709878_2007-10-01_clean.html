(iii) the maximum liability of each indemnifying member for any indemnified loss under section 8.2(b) shall not exceed the amount of such indemnified loss multiplied by the indemnification percentage of such indemnifying member. for purposes of this agreement, " indemnification percentage " means a fraction, the numerator of which is such indemnifying member's pro rata share of the initial merger consideration, and the denominator -81- of which is the aggregate initial merger consideration payable to all indemnifying members. (iv) the maximum aggregate liability of all indemnifying members for indemnification claims under sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) shall be limited to the purchase price. (v) the maximum aggregate liability of parent for indemnification claims under this article 8 shall be limited to $31,500,000, except with respect to indemnification under section 8.2(c)(i) in respect of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in sections 4.1 (first sentence only), 4.2 , 4.5 , 4.12 , 4.22 , 4.23 , 4.24 , 4.25 and 4.26 (for which liability will be limited to an amount equal to the purchase price).

(vii) no party will in any event be liable under this article 8 , and no claim for indemnification may in any event be asserted under this article 8 , for any loss of profits or earnings, or any punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential damages by reason of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or indemnity contained herein; provided that the foregoing is not intended to limit recovery of amounts paid by an indemnified person in connection with the defense, settlement or other resolution of any third party claim (including any punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential damages paid by an indemnified person to any third party). (viii) for the avoidance of doubt, in no event will any indemnifying member have any indemnification obligation under this section 8.2 relating to taxes on the reserve adjusted net cms reconciliation amount received by the company. (e) payment of claims . (i) subject to section 2.14 , if section 8.2(a) requires that an indemnifiable loss be satisfied from the escrow fund, (i) a total number of escrow shares equal to the lesser of (x) the total number of escrow shares remaining in the escrow fund and (y) a number of escrow shares determined by dividing 45% of such indemnifiable loss by the fair market value of a share of -83- parent common stock (provided that if the parent common stock is then traded on the nasdaq global select market, such fair market value shall be determined by reference to the average of the high and low trading price of the parent common stock on a ten trailing day average basis for the last ten trading days immediately preceding the date such indemnifiable loss became payable under section 8.2(a) and (ii) escrow cash, in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of escrow cash remaining in the escrow fund and (y) such amount of the indemnifiable loss that is not paid in escrow shares pursuant to clause (i) above (valued as provided above), shall be paid from the escrow fund to parent. subject to section 2.14 , to the extent that the amount of escrow shares or escrow cash remaining in the escrow fund is insufficient to pay the portion of an indemnifiable loss pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii), as the case may be, of the previous sentence in its entirety, and escrow shares or escrow cash remain in the escrow fund at such time, the remaining escrow shares or escrow cash shall be used to satisfy the remainder of such indemnifiable loss. (ii) subject to section 2.14 , if section 8.2(b) or section 8.2(c) requires that an indemnifiable loss be satisfied other than from the escrow fund, such indemnifiable loss shall be satisfied by means of the delivery to the indemnified person of (i) a total number of shares of parent common stock determined by dividing 45% of such indemnifiable loss by the fair market value of a share of parent common stock (provided that if the parent common stock is then traded on the nasdaq global select market, such fair market value shall be determined by reference to the average of the high and low trading price of the parent common stock on a ten trailing day average basis for the last ten trading days immediately preceding the date such indemnifiable loss became payable under section 8.2(b) or section 8.2(c) , as applicable), and (ii) cash (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the indemnified person, in an amount equal to such amount of the indemnifiable loss that is not paid in shares of parent common stock; provided , however , that any indemnifying member that is obligated to make an indemnification payment to parent pursuant to section 8.2(b) may, at its election, pay more than 55% of such payment amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds. in the event that parent or any other parent indemnified person proposes to make any claim for indemnification pursuant to section 8.2(b) , the indemnified person making the claim shall give notice to the shareholder representative (which notice shall be given, as soon as reasonably practical after the parent indemnified person determines in good faith that it is entitled to bring such claim). any such notice shall describe the facts giving rise to the claim in reasonable detail (in light of the circumstance known at the time). (f) third party claims . (i) notice of claim . if any third party notifies an indemnified person with respect to any matter (a " third party claim ") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against an indemnifying party, then the indemnified person will promptly (and, in any event, within twenty (20) business days) give written -84- notice thereof to the indemnifying party; provided , that no delay on the part of the indemnified person in notifying the indemnifying party will relieve the indemnifying party from any obligation under this article 8 , except to the extent such delay actually and materially prejudices the indemnifying party. (ii) assumption of defense, etc . the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in the defense of any third party claim that is the subject of a notice given by the indemnified person pursuant to section 8.2(f)(i) . in addition, upon written notice to the indemnified person, the indemnifying party will have the right to defend the indemnified person against the third party claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified person, except in the case of third party claims involving taxes under the special circumstances described in clause (v) below in which such clause (v) shall govern. in such event, the indemnified person may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the third party claim. notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to the third party claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified person unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (a) provides for the payment by the indemnifying party of money as sole relief for the claimant and (b) results in the full and general release of all indemnified persons from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection with, the third party claim. for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts incurred in connection with the defense, settlement or other resolution of any third party claims shall be deemed to be losses for purposes of the limitations set forth in section 8.2(d) . (iii) indemnified person's control . if the indemnifying party does not deliver the notice contemplated by section 8.2(f)(ii) within twenty (20) days after the indemnified person has given notice of the third party claim pursuant to section 8.2(f)(i) , the indemnified person may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the third party claim; provided , that the indemnifying party will not be bound by the entry of any such judgment consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected, without its prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). (iv) remedies exclusive . the parties agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in section 8.15 , from and after the closing the remedies provided for in this article 8 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for all losses that any such party may suffer or incur arising from or relating to this agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and the parties hereto hereby waive any other rights or remedies that may arise under any applicable legal requirements and any equitable remedies (provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to in any way limit the rights or remedies of any mhrx indemnified person (or affiliate thereof) who is a participant in the equity financing under securities purchase agreement or any other documents or agreements relating thereto). -85- (v) certain third party claims involving taxe s. if the third party claim involves a tax dispute that (a) includes a tax for which the indemnified person could be liable but for which no indemnity is available hereunder, (b) the amount of tax at issue in clause (a) is larger than the loss at issue (taking into account any reasonably anticipated netting effects pursuant to section 8.2(d) hereof), and (c) the two tax issues cannot be segregated or severed and defended separately, then, the indemnified person shall control the defense of the third party claim, although the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in such defense, including (with the indemnified person's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld) the right to participate on a face-to-face basis in any audit, administrative appeal, court proceeding or settlement discussions, all at its own cost and expense. subject to such continuing participation, the indemnified person may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to the third party claim; provided, that the indemnified person and the indemnifying party shall consult in good faith about any such judgment, compromise or settlement. if the parties are not able to agree on the disposition of the third party claim, the parties will again attempt to sever from such third party claim any dispute regarding any tax described in clause (a) of this clause (v). if such attempted severance occurs, the indemnifying party will take over the defense of the third party claim. if such attempted severance does not occur, the indemnified person has the ultimate right to decide on the disposition of the third party claim, provided that if the indemnifying party objects in writing to the judgment, compromise, or settlement, then the indemnifying party may take over the defense of the third party claim, in which case the indemnifying party shall be liable to the indemnified person for the full amount by which the judgment, compromise or settlement exceeds the amount that would have been obtained in the original judgment, compromise, or settlement (to which the indemnifying party objected). if the defense of the third party claim conducted by the indemnifying party results in a judgment, compromise or settlement amount that is less than the amount that would have been obtained in the original judgment, compromise or settlement (to which the indemnifying party objected), then the indemnifying party may offset any indemnifiable loss otherwise due to the indemnified person by the difference between such amounts. the principles of the foregoing procedures shall also apply to the right to participation, defense and disposition of third party claims in which clauses (a) and (c) hereof apply (but not (b)). other than with respect to the foregoing provisions of this clause (v), the provisions of clauses (i)-(iii) above shall govern.

relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and the holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.09 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the damages referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 2.09, no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds realized by such holder in the sale of registrable securities of such holder to which such damages relate exceeds the amount of any damages that such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. subject to the foregoing and as among the holders, each holder&#146;s obligation to contribute pursuant to this section 2.09 is several in the proportion that the proceeds of the offering received by such holder bears to the total proceeds of the offering received by all such holders and not joint. article 3- other provisions and miscellaneous section 3.01. rule 144 . the company agrees to cause the conditions of rule 144(c) under the securities act to be satisfied with respect to the company at all times during which any of the registrable securities are outstanding. section 3.02. binding effect;
