(b) by pdm. to the extent permitted by law, pdm (i) will indemnify cb&i, ------ each of its officers and directors, and each underwriter, if any, of securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls cb&i or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and each other selling holder of securities, each of its officers and directors, and each person controlling such selling holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) will reimburse cb&i, such selling holders, such officers, directors, partners, legal counsel, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, settling or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, but, in the case of (i) and (ii), only to the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to cb&i for the acknowledged purpose of inclusion in such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus. notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of pdm under this subsection (b) shall be limited in an amount equal to the net proceeds of the applicable cb&i shares sold by pdm, unless such liability arises out of or is based on willful misconduct by pdm. (c) procedure for indemnification. each party indemnified under ----------------------------- subsection (a) or (b) of this section 6.04 (the "indemnified party") shall, ----------------- promptly after receipt of actual notice of any claim or the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of 16 which indemnity may be sought, notify the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") in writing of the claim or the ------------------ commencement thereof, provided that the failure of the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party on account of the indemnity agreement contained in subsection (a) or (b) of this section 6.04, unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by such failure, and in no event shall relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability which it may have to such indemnified party. if any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable (except to the extent the proviso to this sentence is applicable, in which event it will be so liable) to the indemnified party under this section 6.04 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided that each indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent it and assume its defense (in which case, the indemnifying party shall not represent it) if (i) upon the advice of counsel, the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (ii) in the event the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof within 10 days of receipt of notice of such claim or commencement of action, and in which case the fees and expenses of one such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party. the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm for all such indemnified parties, unless conflicting interests of the indemnified parties make the retention of one firm on behalf of all of them unreasonable. if any indemnified party employs such separate counsel it will not enter into any settlement agreement which is not approved by the indemnifying party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. if the indemnifying party so assumes the defense thereof, it may not agree to any settlement of any such claim or action as the result of which any remedy or relief, other than monetary damages for which the indemnifying party shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against the indemnified party, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. in any action hereunder as to which the indemnifying party has assumed the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, the indemnified party shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof with counsel of its own choice, but, except as set forth above, the indemnifying party shall not be obligated hereunder to reimburse the indemnified party for the costs thereof. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section ------------ 6.04 shall for any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, 17 in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand, and the indemnified party on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on the one hand, or the indemnified party on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, but not by reference to any indemnified party's stock ownership in cb&i. in no event, however, shall pdm be required to contribute in excess of the amount of the net proceeds received by pdm in connection with the sale of the applicable cb&i shares in the offering which is the subject of such loss, claim, damage or liability. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this paragraph, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, settling or defending any such action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) conflicts and controlling language. notwithstanding the foregoing, to ---------------------------------- the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with an underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. section 6.05 participation in underwritten registrations. no person may ------------------------------------------- participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten unless such person (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by such person or persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. the foregoing notwithstanding, with respect to any of the documents and/or agreements referred to in this section 6.05, (i) pdm shall not be required to make any representations and warranties with respect to or on behalf of cb&i or any other shareholder of cb&i and (ii) the liability of pdm shall be limited as provided in section 6.04(b). section 6.06 information by pdm. pdm shall promptly furnish to cb&i such ------------------ information regarding pdm and its affiliates as shall be necessary to enable cb&i to comply with the provisions hereof in connection with any registration referred to in this agreement. 18 article vii miscellaneous section 7.01 no assignment; third party beneficiaries.
