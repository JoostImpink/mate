&#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. &#160; stock purchase agreement and merger agreement &#160; on may&#160;14, 2010 (the &#8220; closing date &#8221;), pursuant to an agreement for the purchase and sale of stock dated march&#160;17, 2010 (the &#8220; stock purchase agreement &#8221;) by and among the issuer, sycamore films, and its stockholders (the &#8220; sycamore films stockholders &#8221;), the issuer issued 79,376,735 shares of its common stock to the sycamore films stockholders in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of sycamore films, resulting in a change in control of the issuer. as a result, sycamore films became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer and the sycamore films stockholders now hold in the aggregate approximately eighty-seven percent (87%) of the issuer&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock. the reporting persons (red cat and donald j. scotti) are one of the former sycamore films stockholders, and donald j. scotti now holds through its wholly owned entity red cat 2.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock.. &#160; immediately prior to the closing of the stock purchase agreement, pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated march&#160;17, 2010 (the &#8220; merger agreement &#8221;) by and among the issuer, sycamore films, sweet spot, inc. (&#8220; sweet spot &#8221;) and sweet spot&#8217;s stockholders (jrt and red cat) and principals (joseph r. takats and donald j. scotti), sweet spot merged with and into sycamore films and the sweet spot stockholders became shareholders of sycamore films (the &#8220; merger transaction &#8221;). the merger transaction was effective as of may&#160;14, 2010, upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the ne vada secretary of state, at which time sweet spot ceased to exist. the stock purchase transaction and the merger transaction are collectively referred to herein as the &#8220; transaction .&#8221; &#160; as a result of the transaction, the issuer became a holding company whose primary asset is its ownership of 100% of the outstanding shares of sycamore films. as a result of the merger transaction, sycamore films primary business is that of a full-service distribution and marketing company specializing in acquisition, distribution and the development of marketing campaigns for feature films. &#160; in connection with the closing of the stock purchase agreement the issuer experienced a change in control of the ownership, management and board of directors. as of the closing date, all of the members of the board of directors of the issuer resigned and a new slate of directors and officers were appointed for both the issuer and sycamore films. &#160; as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, the issuer intends to seek stockholder approval to amend its certificate of incorporation to change its name from &#8220;imarx therapeutics, inc.&#8221; to &#8220;sycamore entertainment, inc.,&#8221; to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock, par value $.0001 from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000, to effectuate a reverse stock split of one for two of the issued and outstanding shares of the issuer&#8217;s $.0001 par value common stock, and to change the issuer&#8217;s state of incorporation from delaware to nevada.&#160;&#160;the issuer believes that the issuance of its common stock in connection with the stock purchase agreement was exempt from registration under section&#160;4(2), regulation&#160;d and regulation&#160;s of the securities act. &#160; the foregoing description of the stock purchase agreement and the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entireties by the terms of the stock purchase agreement and the merger agreement, attached as exhibits 3 and 4, respectively, hereto,&#160;&#160;and incorporated by reference herein. &#160; in connection with the transaction, the issuer has entered into a number of other contracts, arrangements and understandings with respect to securities of the issuer, each of which is described below. &#160; convertible promissory notes and security agreements &#160; in addition to the shares of the common stock issued by the issuer under the terms of the stock purchase agreement to red cat in exchange for all the shares of sycamore films common stock held by it, the issuer also executed and delivered to red cat a promissory note in the principal amount of $200,000. the principal balance of the promissory note was convertible at any time over the six month period prior to the maturity of the notes into shares of the issuer&#8217;s common stock at a conversion ratio based on the average of three day trading price of the common stock immediately prior to the date of exercise of the conversion right. the $200,000 promissory note is secured by a first priority perfected pledge of 50% of the shares of stock of sycamore films owned by the issuer.&#160;&#160;in the event of the issuer&#8217;s default on the note, and failure to cure such &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; default within the applicable cure period, red cat may exercise in respect of the sycamore films shares pledged as security for the notes, in addition to other rights and remedies it&#160;&#160;may have, all of the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the uniform commercial code and also may sell the sycamore films shares or any part thereof at public or private sale. &#160; on may 28, 2010, red cat converted the entire principal balance of the promissory note into shares of common stock of the issuer.&#160;&#160;red cat waived any interest that had accrued for the period between may 14 and may 28, 2010.&#160;&#160;as a result of the conversion of red cat&#8217;s promissory note, the amount of issuer&#8217;s outstanding liabilities has been reduced by more than $200,000.00.&#160;&#160;because the issuer&#8217;s certificate of incorporation currently does not authorize sufficient shares to issue the shares acquired by red cat, the shares acquired as a result of the conversion will be issued to red cat following an amendment to the issuer&#8217;s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock of the issuer.&#160;&#160;&#160;the amendment is expected to be approved by the issuer&#8217;s shareholders in july 2010.&#160;&#160;once the additional shares of the issuer&#8217;s common stock&#160;&#160;are authorized and issued to red cat, red cat will release the security interest in shares of common stock of sycamore films &#160;
