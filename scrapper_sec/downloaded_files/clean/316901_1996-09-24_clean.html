subsidiaries (including all of the branches of the seller's two subsidiary banks and all of the seller's properties acquired by foreclosure proceedings in the ordinary course of business but excluding any specific listing of any real property carried at nominal value, for which only a generic description will be included on such schedule) as of the date hereof. the seller directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, including, without limitation, the capital stock of its subsidiaries and all other assets and properties reflected in its consolidated balance sheet as of june 30, 1996, or acquired subsequent thereto subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (a) those items that secure liabilities that are reflected in said balance sheet or the notes thereto or incurred in the ordinary course of business after the date of such balance sheet and not otherwise prohibited by the terms hereof, (b) dispositions for adequate consideration in the ordinary course of business or as expressly permitted by the terms hereof, (c) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith, (d) those items that secure public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from, or other

mortgages, security interests, and pledges that are not material in character, amount or extent. neither the seller nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of violation of any applicable zoning or environmental regulation, ordinance or other law, order, regulation, or requirement relating to its properties, except as set forth in section 4.14 of the seller disclosure schedule. the seller and its subsidiaries as lessees have the right under valid and existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control all property leased by the seller and its subsidiaries as presently occupied, used, possessed and controlled by the seller and its subsidiaries. neither the seller nor any of its subsidiaries is in default, and there has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or giving of notice or both would constitute a default, under any leases pursuant to which the seller or any of its subsidiaries leases any real property, except for such defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in the forfeiture of the use or occupancy of the property covered by any such lease or would not result in a material liability to the seller or any significant subsidiary of the seller which is not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the seller dated as of june 30, 1996. all such leases constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the seller or its subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the seller, the other party thereto, enforceable by the seller or such subsidiary in accordance with their respective terms, except that enforcement thereof may be limited by the receivership, conservatorship and supervisory powers of bank regulatory agencies generally as well as bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that enforcement thereof may be subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the availability of equitable remedies. section 4.14 of the seller disclosure schedule sets forth the expiration date and renewal terms of each such lease. neither the seller nor any of its subsidiaries has received notice of, or made a claim with respect to, any breach or default under any leases pursuant to which the seller or any of its subsidiaries lease any real property. 4.15 reports. since january 1, 1993, the seller and its subsidiaries have filed, and subsequent to the date hereof will file, all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that were and are required to be filed with (a) the sec, including, but not limited to, forms 10-k, forms 10-q, forms 8-k and proxy statements (and all such reports, registrations and statements have been or will be delivered by the seller to the buyer), (b) the federal reserve board, (c) the fdic, and (d) any applicable state securities or banking authorities (except, in the case of state securities authorities, no such representation is made as to filings which are not material) (all such reports and statements are collectively referred to herein as the "seller reports"). as of their respective dates, the seller reports complied and, with respect to filings made after the date of this agreement, will at the date of filing comply, in all material respects with all of the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by the regulatory authority with which they were filed and did not contain and, with respect to filings made after the date of this agreement, will not at the date of filing contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 4.16 compliance with applicable law. each of the seller and each significant subsidiary thereof holds all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of its business, and each of the seller and each significant subsidiary thereof has complied with and is not in violation of or default in any respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation or policy of, or agreement with, any federal, state or local governmental agency or authority relating to the seller or such significant subsidiary (other than where such default or noncompliance will not result in, or create the possibility of resulting in, a material limitation on the conduct of the business of the seller, will not cause, or create the possibility of causing, the seller or any significant subsidiary thereof to incur any financial penalty in excess of $20,000 (including but not limited to any civil money penalty or other monetary sanction under section 8(i)(2) of the fdia, 12 u.s.c. ss.1818(i)(2), or under any applicable state law ("cmps")), and will not otherwise result, or create the possibility of resulting in any material adverse effect on the seller or any significant subsidiary of the seller), and neither the seller nor any significant subsidiary of the seller has received any notice of any violation of any such law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or agreement, or the commencement of any proceeding in connection with any such violation (including but not limited to any hearing or investigation relating to the imposition or contemplated imposition of cmps), and does not know of any violation of, any such law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or agreement which would have such a result. 4.17 environmental matters.

all material respects with all applicable loan loss reserve requirements established in accordance with gaap and by any governmental authorities having jurisdiction with respect to the seller or any

and information relating to or constituting the buyer's or any of its affiliate's or representatives' work product, presentations or evaluation materials as the buyer deems reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with auditing or examination purposes. the obligation to keep such information confidential shall continue for two (2) years from the date this agreement is terminated. in the event that either party or its affiliates or representatives are requested or required in the context of a litigation, governmental, judicial or regulatory investigation or other similar proceeding (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or similar process) to disclose any confidential information, the party or its affiliate or its representative so requested or required will directly or through the party of such affiliate or representative, if practicable and legally permitted, prior to providing such information, and as promptly as practicable after receiving such request, provide the other party with notice of each such request or requirement so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy or, if appropriate, waive compliance with the provisions of this agreement. if, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the party or affiliate or representative so requested or required is, in the written opinion of its counsel, legally required to disclose confidential information to any tribunal, governmental or regulatory authority, or similar body, the party or affiliate or representative so required may disclose that portion of the confidential information which it is advised in writing by such counsel it is legally required to so disclose to such tribunal or authority or similar body without liability to the other party hereto for such disclosure. the parties and their affiliates and representatives will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the information so disclosed. as used in this section 5.02(b), "confidential information" means all data, reports, interpretations, forecasts and records (whether in written form, electronically stored or otherwise) containing or otherwise reflecting information concerning the disclosing party or its

party or to the receiving party's affiliates or representatives at any time in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement, including but not limited to any information obtained by meeting with representatives of the disclosing party or its affiliates, together with summaries, analyses, extracts, compilations, studies, personal notes or other documents or records, whether prepared by the receiving party or others, which contain or otherwise reflect such information. notwithstanding the foregoing, the following information will not constitute "confidential information": (i) information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving party or any affiliate or representative of the receiving party, (ii) information that was previously known to the receiving party or its affiliates or representatives on a nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party, its affiliates or representatives, (iii) information that became or becomes available to the receiving party or any affiliate or representative thereof on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the disclosing party or any affiliate or representatives of the disclosing party, provided that such source is not known by the disclosing party or its affiliates or representatives to be subject to any confidentiality agreement or other legal restriction on disclosing such information and (iv) information that has been independently acquired or developed by the receiving party or its affiliates or representatives without violating the obligation's of this section 5.02(b). 5.03 no solicitation. unless and until this agreement shall have been properly terminated by either party pursuant to section 8.01 hereof, neither the seller nor any of its subsidiaries shall (and the seller and each of its subsidiaries shall use its best efforts to cause its representatives, including, but not limited to, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, not to), directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, initiate or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or, subject to the

(i) by virtue of the merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock of the seller, par value $1.00 per share ("seller common stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than any such shares held directly or indirectly by the buyer, except in a fiduciary capacity, and any such shares held as treasury stock by the seller) shall become and be converted into 1.9 shares of the common stock of the buyer, par value $0.625 per share ("buyer common stock"), together with that number of buyer rights issued pursuant to the buyer rights agreement associated therewith; provided, however, that in the event that the buyer has exercised its option to deliver additional shares of its common stock pursuant to the last paragraph of section 8.01(f) of the agreement, seller's common stock shall be converted into such number of shares of the common stock of the buyer, par value $0.625 per share, as provided in said section of the agreement. the number of shares of buyer common stock into which each share of seller common stock shall be converted is hereinafter called the "conversion number." (ii) as of the effective time, each share of seller common stock held either directly or indirectly by the buyer (other than in a fiduciary capacity) or as treasury stock of the seller shall be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. each certificate which immediately prior to the effective time represented outstanding shares of seller common stock shall on and after the effective time be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of buyer common stock into which the shares of seller common stock represented by such certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this section 2.01(b). (c) shares of dissenting holders. no conversion under section 2.01(b) hereof shall be made with respect to the shares of seller common stock held by a dissenting holder (as such term is defined below); provided, however, that each share of seller common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by a dissenting holder who shall, after the effective time, withdraw his demand for appraisal or lose his right of appraisal, in either case pursuant to the applicable provisions of the mbcl, shall be deemed to be converted, as of the effective time, into shares of buyer common stock as specified in section 2.01(b) hereof. the term "dissenting holder" shall mean a holder of seller common stock who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with the applicable provisions of the mbcl concerning the right of such holder to dissent from the merger and demand appraisal of such holder's shares of seller common stock.

(b) as promptly as practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent shall send to each holder of record of shares of seller common stock outstanding at the effective time transmittal materials (which shall be reviewed with the seller's counsel prior to the effective time) for use in exchanging the certificates for such shares for certificates for shares of buyer common stock into which such shares of seller common stock have been converted pursuant to this article ii. upon surrender of a certificate, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, a certificate for the number of shares of buyer common stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 2.01(b) hereof, and such certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. no dividend or other distribution payable after the effective time with respect to buyer common stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate until the holder thereof surrenders such certificate, at which time such holder shall receive all dividends and distributions, without interest thereon, previously payable but withheld from such holder pursuant hereto. after the effective time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the seller of shares of seller common stock which were issued and outstanding at the effective time and converted pursuant to the provisions of this article ii. if, after the effective time, certificates are presented for transfer to the seller, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the shares of buyer common stock deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with the provisions and procedures set forth in this article ii. (c) in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of buyer common stock pursuant to sections 2.01(b) of this plan of merger, cash adjustments, without interest, will be paid to the holders of seller common stock in respect of any fractional share that would otherwise be issuable and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal to an amount in cash determined by multiplying such holder's fractional interest by the "average price" of a share of buyer common stock (rounded up to the nearest cent). the "closing price" of a share of buyer common stock shall be the average of the last sale prices thereof as reported on the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system over the ten (10) consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the date on which the last requisite regulatory approval is received (without regard to any waiting period attached to the effectiveness thereof). for purposes of determining whether, and in what amounts, a particular holder of seller common stock would be entitled to receive cash adjustments under this section 2.03(c), shares of record held by such holder and represented by two or more certificates shall be aggregated.

(f) in the event any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon receipt of appropriate evidence as to such loss, theft or destruction and to the ownership of such certificate by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and the receipt by the buyer of appropriate and customary indemnification, the buyer will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate shares of buyer common stock and the fractional share payment, if any, deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this article ii. (g) if any certificate representing shares of buyer common stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer (including, but not limited to, that the signature of the transferor shall be properly guaranteed by a commercial bank, trust company, member firm of the nasd or other eligible guarantor institution), and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the exchange agent (as such term is defined in section 4.01 hereof) in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of buyer common stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 2.04 conversion of options. each stock option (other than the seller option) issued by the seller to a third party, whether or not currently exercisable, which entitles such third party to purchase seller common stock, and which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, shall be converted into an option to purchase shares of buyer common stock, and the buyer shall assume each such option in accordance with the terms of the seller stock option plan under which it was granted and the stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, with the following terms: (a) the number of shares of buyer common stock shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of seller common stock previously subject thereto and the conversion number, rounded down to the nearest whole share; and (b) the exercise price per share of buyer common stock shall be equal to the exercise price per share of seller common stock previously subject thereto divided by the conversion number, rounded up to the nearest cent; and (c) the duration and other terms of such stock option shall be unchanged except that all references to the seller shall be deemed to be references to the buyer; and (d) the buyer shall assume the option as contemplated by section 424(a) of the code; and (e) with respect to any stock option on seller's common stock which is an incentive stock option within the meaning of section 422 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, the buyer shall take such actions (other than delaying the date the options on buyer common stock become exercisable beyond the date on which such options would otherwise become exercisable pursuant to the relevant seller stock plan) as may be necessary or appropriate to cause such option, upon being converted to an option on buyer common stock, to remain such an incentive stock option. article iii amendment and

registration statement under said act or an exemption from such registration." f. i also understand that unless the transfer by me of my buyer common stock has been registered under the act or is a

have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which rule 145 promulgated under the securities act of 1933 applies. the shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of securities act of 1933 and may not be sold,

beneficial owner of the buyer common stock for at least three years (or such period as may be prescribed by the securities act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), or (v) buyer shall have received a letter from the staff of the commission, or an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to buyer, to the effect that the stock transfer restrictions and the legend are not required. i further represent to and covenant with buyer that from the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the effective time (as defined in the merger agreement) i will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or reduce the risk of ownership with respect to, shares of seller common stock held by me and that i will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or reduce the risk of ownership with respect

(c) the term "holder" shall mean the holder or holders of the option.

(g) the issuer shall notify the grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any initial triggering event or subsequent triggering event (together, a "triggering event"), it being understood that the giving of such notice by the issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the holder to exercise the option.

(i) at the closing, the holder shall pay to the issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the option in immediately available funds by a wire transfer to a bank account designated by the issuer, provided that failure or refusal of the issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the holder from exercising the option. (j) at such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in paragraph (i) above, the issuer shall deliver to the holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of common stock purchased by the holder and, if the option should be exercised in part only, a new option evidencing the rights of the holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the holder shall deliver to the issuer a copy of this agreement and a letter agreeing that the holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this agreement. (k) certificates for the common stock delivered at a closing hereunder may (in the sole discretion of the issuer) be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows: "the transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to restriction pursuant to the terms of a stock option agreement dated as of august 30, 1996, a copy of which agreement will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by the issuer of a written request therefor." it is understood and agreed that the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such legend. in addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. (l) upon the giving by the holder to the issuer of the written notice of exercise of the option provided for under paragraph (h) above, the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds and the tender of a copy of this agreement to the issuer, such holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of common stock shall not then be actually delivered to the holder. the issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all united states federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates under this section 2 in the name of the holder or its assignee, transferee or designee. 3. the issuer agrees (a) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of common stock so that the option may be exercised without requiring the issuer's stockholders to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase common stock, (b) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by the issuer, (c) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including without limitation cooperating fully with any holders in preparing any applications or notices required under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, or the change in bank control act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law), in order to permit such holders to exercise the option and the issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of common stock pursuant hereto, and (d) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of any holders against dilution. 4. this agreement (and the option granted hereby) is exchangeable, without expense, at the option of each holder, upon presentation and surrender of this agreement at the principal office of the issuer, for other agreements providing for options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of common stock purchasable hereunder. the terms "agreement" and "option" as used herein include any stock option agreements and related options for which this agreement (and the option granted hereby) may be exchanged. upon receipt by the issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this agreement, if mutilated, the issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date. any such new agreement executed and delivered shall constitute for all purposes and under all circumstances a contractual obligation on the part of the issuer, whether or not this agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone. 5. in addition to the adjustment in the number of option shares pursuant to section 1 of this agreement, the number of option shares shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this section 5. (a) (i) in the event of any change in the shares of common stock by reason of stock dividend, split up, merger, recapitalization, subdivision, conversion, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the type and number of option shares, and the option price therefor, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that the grantee shall receive upon exercise of the option the number and class of shares or other securities or property that the grantee would have held immediately after such event if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable. (ii) the issuer may make such increases in the number of option shares, in addition to those required under subparagraph (a)(i) above, as shall be determined by its board of directors to be advisable in order to avoid taxation, so far as practicable, of any dividend of stock or stock rights or any event treated as such for federal income tax purposes to the recipients. (b) whenever the number of option shares (or other securities) purchasable upon exercise hereof is adjusted as provided in this section 5, the option price shall be adjusted by multiplying the option price by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of option shares prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which is equal to the number of option shares (or other securities) purchasable after the adjustment. 6. upon the occurrence of a subsequent triggering event that occurs prior to an exercise termination event, issuer shall, at the request of grantee delivered within thirty (30) days of such subsequent triggering event (whether on the grantor's own behalf or on the behalf of any subsequent holder of this option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of common stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current, with respect to the option and the option shares, a "shelf" registration statement under rule 415 of the securities act or any successor provision, and issuer shall use its best efforts to qualify such shares under any applicable state securities laws. issuer will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect sales or other dispositions of option shares. grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. any registration statement prepared and filed under this section 6, and any sales covered thereby, shall be at issuer's expense, except for underwriting discounts or commissions, broker's fees and expenses and the fees and disbursements of grantee's counsel related thereto. the foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by grantee for registration of the option or option shares as provided above, issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of common stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering, the inclusion of the option or option shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares represented by the option the number of option shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; provided, however, that if such reduction occurs, the issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practical and no reduction shall thereafter occur. each such holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. if requested by any such holder in connection with such registration, issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting agreements for the issuer. 7. (a) upon the occurrence of a subsequent triggering event that occurs prior to an exercise termination event, (i) at the request of any holder, delivered within thirty (30) days following such occurrence (or such later period as provided in section 10), the issuer shall repurchase the option from the holder at a price (the "option repurchase price") equal to the amount by which (a) the market/offer price (as defined below) exceeds (b) the option price, multiplied by the number of shares for which this option may then be exercised, plus, to the extent not previously reimbursed, the grantee's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by, and the enforcement of the grantee's rights under, the acquisition agreement, including without limitation legal, accounting and investment banking fees (the "grantee's out-of-pocket expenses"), and (ii) at the request of any owner of option shares from time to time (the "owner"), delivered within thirty (30) days following such occurrence (or such later period as provided in section 10), the issuer shall repurchase such number of the option shares from such owner as the owner shall designate at a price per share ("option share repurchase price") equal to the greater of (a) the market/offer price and (b) the average exercise price per share paid by the owner for the option shares so designated, plus, to the extent not previously reimbursed, the grantee's out-of-pocket expenses. the term "market/offer price" shall mean the highest of (w) the price per share of the common stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (x) the price per share of the common stock to be paid by any person, other than the grantee or a subsidiary of the grantee, pursuant to an agreement with the issuer, (y) the highest closing price for shares of common stock within the six (6) month period immediately preceding the required repurchase of options or option shares, as the case may be, or (z) in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of the issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by a majority in the interest of the holders or the owners, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the issuer, divided by the number of shares of common stock of the issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. in determining the market/offer price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by a majority in interest of the holders or the owners, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the issuer. (b) each holder and owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require the issuer to repurchase the option and any option shares pursuant to this section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to the issuer, at its principal office, a copy of this agreement or certificates for option shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that such holder or owner elects to require the issuer to repurchase this option and/or option shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 7. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) business days after the surrender of the option and/or certificates representing option shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each holder the option repurchase price and/or to each owner the option share repurchase price therefor or the portion thereof that the issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering. (c) to the extent that the issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, or as a result of a written agreement or other binding obligation with a governmental or regulatory body or agency, from repurchasing the option and/or the option shares in full, the issuer shall immediately so notify each holder and/or each owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to such holder and/or owner, as appropriate, the portion of the option repurchase price and the option share repurchase price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within ten (10) business days after the date on which the issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if the issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from delivering to any holder and/or owner, as appropriate, the option repurchase price and the option share repurchase price, respectively, in part or in full (and the issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to receive all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), such holder or owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the option or the option shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon the issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to such holder and/or owner, as appropriate, that portion of the option purchase price or the option share repurchase price that the issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (a) to such holder, a new stock option agreement evidencing the right of such holder to purchase that number of shares of common stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of common stock for which the surrendered stock option agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the option repurchase price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the holder and the denominator of which is the option repurchase price, or (b) to such owner, a certificate for the option shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. 8. (a) in the event that prior to an exercise termination event, the issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than the grantee or one of the grantee's subsidiaries, and the issuer shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than the grantee or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into the issuer and the issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property, or the then outstanding shares of common stock shall, after such merger, represent less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than the grantee or one of the grantee's subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the option shall upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "substitute option"), at the election of the holder, of either (a) the acquiring corporation (as defined in paragraph (b) below) or (b) any person that controls the acquiring corporation. (b) the following terms have the meanings indicated: (i) the term "acquiring corporation" shall mean (a) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with the issuer (if other than the issuer), (b) the issuer in a merger in which the issuer is the continuing or surviving person, and (c) the transferee of all or substantially all of the issuer's assets. (ii) the term "substitute common stock" shall mean the common stock issued by the issuer of the substitute option upon exercise of the substitute option. (iii) the term "assigned value" shall mean the "market/offer price", as defined in paragraph (a) of section 7 hereof. (iv) the term "average price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the substitute common stock for the one (1) year period immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of the substitute common stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale, provided that if the issuer is the issuer of the substitute option, the average price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into the issuer or by any company which controls such person, as the holder may elect. (c) the substitute option shall have the same terms as the option, provided that if the terms of the substitute option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the option, such terms shall, to the extent legally permissible, be as similar as possible to, and in no event less advantageous to the holder than, the terms of the option. the issuer of the substitute option shall also enter into an agreement with the then holder or holders of the substitute option in substantially the same form as this agreement, which shall be applicable to the substitute option. (d) the substitute option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of the substitute common stock as is equal to (i) the product of (a) the assigned value and (b) the number of shares of common stock for which the option is then exercisable, divided by (ii) the average price. the exercise price of the substitute option per share of the substitute common stock shall then be equal to the option price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of option shares and the denominator is the number of shares of the substitute common stock for which the substitute option is exercisable. (e) in no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the substitute option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the aggregate of the shares of the substitute common stock outstanding prior to exercise of the substitute option (without giving effect to any shares of substitute common stock issued pursuant to the substitute option) less the number of shares previously issued pursuant to the substitute option. in the event that the substitute option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of substitute common stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this paragraph (e), the issuer of the substitute option (the "substitute option issuer") shall make a cash payment to the holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the substitute option without giving effect to the limitation in this paragraph (e) over (ii) the value of the substitute option after giving effect to the limitation in this paragraph (e). the difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by a majority in interest of the holders or the owners, as the case may be. (f) the issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section 8 unless the acquiring corporation and any person that controls the acquiring corporation shall have assumed in writing all the obligations of the issuer hereunder. 9. (a) at the written request of the holder of the substitute option (the "substitute option holder"), the issuer of the substitute option (the "substitute option issuer") shall repurchase the substitute option from the substitute option holder at a price (the "substitute option repurchase price") equal to the amount by which (i) the highest closing price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the substitute option, multiplied by the number of shares of the substitute common stock for which the substitute option may then be exercised, plus to the extent not previously reimbursed, the grantee's out-of-pocket expenses, and at the request of each owner (the "substitute share owner") of shares of the substitute common stock (the "substitute shares"), the substitute option issuer shall repurchase the substitute shares at a price per share (the "substitute share repurchase price") equal to the greater of (a) the highest closing price and (b) the average exercise price per share paid by the substitute share owner for the substitute shares so designated, plus, to the extent not previously reimbursed, the grantee's out-of-pocket expenses. the term "highest closing price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of the substitute common stock within the six (6) month period immediately preceding the date the substitute option holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the substitute option or the substitute share owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the substitute shares, as applicable. (b) each substitute option holder and the substitute share owner, as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the substitute option issuer to repurchase the substitute option and the substitute shares pursuant to this section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the substitute option issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such substitute option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this agreement) and certificates for substitute shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that such substitute option holder or substitute share owner elects to require the substitute option issuer to repurchase the substitute option and/or the substitute shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 9. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) business days after the surrender of the substitute option and/or the certificates representing substitute shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the substitute option issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the substitute option holder the substitute option repurchase price and/or to the substitute share owner the substitute share repurchase price therefor, or the portion(s) thereof which the substitute option issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering. (c) to the extent that the substitute option issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, or as a result of a written agreement or other binding obligation with a governmental or regulatory body or agency, from repurchasing the substitute option and/or the substitute shares in full, the substitute option issuer shall immediately so notify each substitute option holder and/or the substitute share owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the substitute option holder and/or substitute share owner, as appropriate, that portion of the substitute option repurchase price and the substitute share repurchase price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five (5) business days after the date on which the substitute option issuer is no longer so prohibited, provided, however, that if the substitute option issuer is, at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 9 prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, or as a result of a written agreement or other binding obligation with a governmental or regulatory body or agency, from delivering to the substitute option holder and/or the substitute share owner, as appropriate, the substitute option repurchase price and the substitute share repurchase price, respectively, in part or in full (and the substitute option issuer shall use its best efforts to receive all required regulatory and legal approvals as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the substitute option holder or substitute share owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the substitute option or the substitute shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon the substitute option issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the substitute option holder or substitute share owner, as appropriate, that portion of the substitute option repurchase price or the substitute share repurchase price that the substitute option issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (a) to the substitute option holder, a new substitute option evidencing the right of the substitute option holder to purchase that number of shares of the substitute common stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the substitute common stock for which the surrendered substitute option was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the substitute option repurchase price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the substitute option holder and the denominator of which is the substitute option repurchase price, or (b) to the substitute share owner, a certificate for the substitute option shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. 10. the thirty (30) day period for exercise of certain rights under sections 2, 6, 7 and 12 hereof shall be extended in each such case: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under section 16(b) of the exchange act by reason of such exercise, provided that notice of intent to exercise such rights shall be given to the issuer within the requisite thirty (30) day period and the grantee and the holders shall use their best efforts to promptly obtain all requisite approvals and cause the expiration of all requisite waiting periods. 11. the issuer hereby represents and warrants to the grantee as follows: (a) the issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. the execution and delivery of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the board of directors of the issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the issuer are necessary to authorize this agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. this agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the issuer. this agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the issuer, enforceable against the issuer in accordance with its respective terms, except that enforcement thereof may be limited by the receivership, conservatorship and supervisory powers of bank regulatory agencies generally as well as bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that enforcement thereof may be subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the availability of equitable remedies. (b) the issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the termination of this agreement in accordance with its terms will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the option, that number of shares of common stock equal to the maximum number of shares of common stock at any time and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights. 12. neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations under this option agreement or the option created hereunder to any other person, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the express written consent of the other party, except that in the event a subsequent triggering event shall have occurred prior to an exercise termination event, the grantee may, subject to the right of first refusal set forth in section 13, assign, transfer or sell in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within thirty (30) days following such subsequent triggering event (or such later period as provided in section 10); provided, however, that in the event the grantee sells, assigns or transfers all or a portion of the option to other holders as permitted by this agreement, the grantee may exercise its rights hereunder on behalf of itself and such holders. 13. if at any time after the occurrence of a subsequent triggering event and, with respect to shares of common stock or other securities acquired by the grantee pursuant to an exercise of the option, prior to the expiration of twenty-four (24) months after the expiration of the option pursuant to section 2(b), the grantee shall desire to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of the option, in whole or in part, or all or any of the shares of common stock or other securities acquired by the grantee pursuant to the option, the grantee shall give the issuer written notice of the proposed transaction (an "offeror's notice"), identifying the proposed transferee, accompanied by a copy of a binding offer to purchase the option or such shares or other securities signed by such transferee and setting forth the terms of the proposed transaction. an offeror's notice shall be deemed an offer by the grantee to the issuer, which may be accepted within ten (10) business days of the receipt of such offeror's notice, on the same terms and conditions and at the same price at which the grantee is proposing to transfer the option or such shares or other securities to such transferee. the purchase of the option or such shares or other securities by the issuer shall be settled within five (5) business days of the date of the acceptance of the offer and the purchase price shall be paid to the grantee in immediately available funds, provided that, if prior notification to or approval, consent or waiver of the federal reserve board or any other regulatory authority is required in connection with such purchase, the issuer shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval, consent or waiver and shall expeditiously process the same (and the grantee shall cooperate with the issuer in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval) and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (a) the required notification period has expired or been terminated or (b) such approval has been obtained and, in either event, any requisite waiting period shall have passed. in the event of the failure or refusal of the issuer to purchase the option or the shares or other securities, as the case may be, covered by an offeror's notice or if the federal reserve board or any other regulatory authority disapproves the issuer's proposed purchase of the option or such shares or other securities, the grantee may, within sixty (60) days following the date of the offeror's notice (subject to any necessary extension for regulatory notification, approval, or waiting periods), sell all, but not less than all, of the portion of the option (which may be one hundred percent (100%)) or such shares or other securities, as the case may be, proposed to be transferred to the proposed transferee identified in the offeror's notice at no less than the price specified and on terms no more favorable to the proposed transferee than those set forth in the offeror's notice. the requirements of this section 13 shall not apply to (i) any disposition of the option or any shares of common stock or other securities by a person to whom the grantee has assigned its rights under the option with the prior written consent of the issuer, (ii) any sale by means of a public offering in which steps are taken to reasonably ensure that no purchaser will acquire securities representing more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the issuer or (iii) any transfer to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the grantee which agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof. 14. each of the grantee and the issuer will use all reasonable efforts to make all filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and governmental authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement, including without limitation applying to the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, for approval to acquire the shares issuable hereunder. 15. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that the holder or the owner or any related person thereof (as hereinafter defined) is a person making an offer or proposal to engage in an acquisition transaction (other than the transaction contemplated by the acquisition agreement), then (a) in the case of a holder or any related person thereof, the option held by it shall immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect, and (b) in the case of an owner or any related person thereof, the option shares held by it shall be immediately repurchasable by the issuer at the option price. for purposes of this agreement, a "related person" of a holder or owner means any affiliate (as defined in rule 12b-2 of the rules and regulations under the exchange act) of the holder or the owner and any person that is required to file a schedule 13d with the holder or the owner with respect to shares of common stock or options to acquire the common stock. 16. the parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief. 17. if any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. if for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that the holder is not permitted to acquire, or the issuer is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to section 7, the full number of shares of common stock provided in section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to sections 1(b) or 5 hereof), it is the express intention of the issuer to allow the holder to acquire or to require the issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof. 18. all notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the acquisition agreement. 19. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. 20. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 21. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel. 22. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. the terms and conditions of this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. nothing in this agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this agreement, except as expressly provided herein. 23. capitalized terms used in this agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the acquisition agreement. in witness whereof, each of the parties has caused this agreement to be executed as a sealed instrument on its behalf by its officers thereunder duly authorized, all as of the day and year first above written. walden bancorp, inc.

(g) the issuer shall notify the grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any initial triggering event or subsequent triggering event (together, a "triggering event"), it being understood that the giving of such notice by the issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the holder to exercise the option. (h) in the event the holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the option, it shall send to the issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "notice date") specifying (i) the total number of shares of common stock it will purchase pursuant to such exercise, and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three (3) business days nor later than forty-five (45) business days from the notice date for the closing of such purchase (the "closing"); provided that if prior notification to or approval of the federal reserve board or any other regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the holder shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. the term "business day" for purposes of this agreement means any day, excluding saturdays, sundays and any other day that is a legal holiday in the commonwealth of massachusetts or a day on which banking institutions in the commonwealth of massachusetts are authorized by law or executive order to close. (i) at the closing, the holder shall pay to the issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the option in immediately available funds by a wire transfer to a bank account designated by the issuer, provided that failure or refusal of the issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the holder from exercising the option. (j) at such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in paragraph (i) above, the issuer shall deliver to the holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of common stock purchased by the holder and, if the option should be exercised in part only, a new option evidencing the rights of the holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the holder shall deliver to the issuer a copy of this agreement and a letter agreeing that the holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this agreement. (k) certificates for the common stock delivered at a closing hereunder may (in the sole discretion of the issuer) be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows: "the transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to restriction pursuant to the terms of a stock option agreement dated as of august 30, 1996, a copy of which agreement will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by the issuer of a written request therefor." it is understood and agreed that the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such legend. in addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. (l) upon the giving by the holder to the issuer of the written notice of exercise of the option provided for under paragraph (h) above, the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds and the tender of a copy of this agreement to the issuer, such holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of common stock shall not then be actually delivered to the holder. the issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all united states federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates under this section 2 in the name of the holder or its assignee, transferee or designee. 3. the issuer agrees (a) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of common stock so that the option may be exercised without requiring the issuer's stockholders to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase common stock, (b) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by the issuer, (c) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including without limitation cooperating fully with any holders in preparing any applications or notices required under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, or the change in bank control act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law), in order to permit such holders to exercise the option and the issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of common stock pursuant hereto, and (d) promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of any holders against dilution. 4. this agreement (and the option granted hereby) is exchangeable, without expense, at the option of each holder, upon presentation and surrender of this agreement at the principal office of the issuer, for other agreements providing for options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of common stock purchasable hereunder. the terms "agreement" and "option" as used herein include any stock option agreements and related options for which this agreement (and the option granted hereby) may be exchanged. upon receipt by the issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this agreement, if mutilated, the issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date. any such new agreement executed and delivered shall constitute for all purposes and under all circumstances a contractual obligation on the part of the issuer, whether or not this agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone. 5. in addition to the adjustment in the number of option shares pursuant to section 1 of this agreement, the number of option shares shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this section 5. (a) (i) in the event of any change in the shares of common stock by reason of stock dividend, split up, merger, recapitalization, subdivision, conversion, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the type and number of option shares, and the option price therefor, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that the grantee shall receive upon exercise of the option the number and class of shares or other securities or property that the grantee would have held immediately after such event if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable. (ii) the issuer may make such increases in the number of option shares, in addition to those required under subparagraph (a)(i) above, as shall be determined by its board of directors to be advisable in order to avoid taxation, so far as practicable, of any dividend of stock or stock rights or any event treated as such for federal income tax purposes to the recipients. (b) whenever the number of option shares (or other securities) purchasable upon exercise hereof is adjusted as provided in this section 5, the option price shall be adjusted by multiplying the option price by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of option shares prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which is equal to the number of option shares (or other securities) purchasable after the adjustment. 6. upon the occurrence of a subsequent triggering event that occurs prior to an exercise termination event, issuer shall, at the request of grantee delivered within thirty (30) days of such subsequent triggering event (whether on the grantor's own behalf or on the behalf of any subsequent holder of this option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of common stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current, with respect to the option and the option shares, a "shelf" registration statement under rule 415 of the securities act or any successor provision, and issuer shall use its best efforts to qualify such shares under any applicable state securities laws. issuer will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect sales or other dispositions of option shares. grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. any registration statement prepared and filed under this section 6, and any sales covered thereby, shall be at issuer's expense, except for underwriting discounts or commissions, broker's fees and expenses and the fees and disbursements of grantee's counsel related thereto. the foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by grantee for registration of the option or option shares as provided above, issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of common stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering, the inclusion of the option or option shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares represented by the option the number of option shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; provided, however, that if such reduction occurs, the issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practical and no reduction shall thereafter occur. each such holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. if requested by any such holder in connection with such registration, issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting agreements for the issuer. 7. (a) upon the occurrence of a subsequent triggering event that occurs prior to an exercise termination event, (i) at the request of any holder, delivered within thirty (30) days following such occurrence (or such later period as provided in section 10), the issuer shall repurchase the option from the holder at a price (the "option repurchase price") equal to the amount by which (a) the market/offer price (as defined below) exceeds (b) the option price, multiplied by the number of shares for which this option may then be exercised, plus, to the extent not previously reimbursed, the grantee's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by, and the enforcement of the grantee's rights under, the acquisition agreement, including without limitation legal, accounting and investment banking fees (the "grantee's out-of-pocket expenses"), and (ii) at the request of any owner of option shares from time to time (the "owner"), delivered within thirty (30) days following such occurrence (or such later period as provided in section 10), the issuer shall repurchase such number of the option shares from such owner as the owner shall designate at a price per share ("option share repurchase price") equal to the greater of (a) the market/offer price and (b) the average exercise price per share paid by the owner for the option shares so designated, plus, to the extent not previously reimbursed, the grantee's out-of-pocket expenses. the term "market/offer price" shall mean the highest of (w) the price per share of the common stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (x) the price per share of the common stock to be paid by any person, other than the grantee or a subsidiary of the grantee, pursuant to an agreement with the issuer, (y) the highest closing price for shares of common stock within the six (6) month period immediately preceding the required repurchase of options or option shares, as the case may be, or (z) in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of the issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by a majority in the interest of the holders or the owners, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the issuer, divided by the number of shares of common stock of the issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. in determining the market/offer price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by a majority in interest of the holders or the owners, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the issuer. (b) each holder and owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require the issuer to repurchase the option and any option shares pursuant to this section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to the issuer, at its principal office, a copy of this agreement or certificates for option shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that such holder or owner elects to require the issuer to repurchase this option and/or option shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 7. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) business days after the surrender of the option and/or certificates representing option shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each holder the option repurchase price and/or to each owner the option share repurchase price therefor or the portion thereof that the issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering. (c) to the extent that the issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, or as a result of a written agreement or other binding obligation with a governmental or regulatory body or agency, from repurchasing the option and/or the option shares in full, the issuer shall immediately so notify each holder and/or each owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to such holder and/or owner, as appropriate, the portion of the option repurchase price and the option share repurchase price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within ten (10) business days after the date on which the issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if the issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from delivering to any holder and/or owner, as appropriate, the option repurchase price and the option share repurchase price, respectively, in part or in full (and the issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to receive all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), such holder or owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the option or the option shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon the issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to such holder and/or owner, as appropriate, that portion of the option purchase price or the option share repurchase price that the issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (a) to such holder, a new stock option agreement evidencing the right of such holder to purchase that number of shares of common stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of common stock for which the surrendered stock option agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the option repurchase price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the holder and the denominator of which is the option repurchase price, or (b) to such owner, a certificate for the option shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. 8. (a) in the event that prior to an exercise termination event, the issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than the grantee or one of the grantee's subsidiaries, and the issuer shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than the grantee or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into the issuer and the issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property, or the then outstanding shares of common stock shall, after such merger, represent less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than the grantee or one of the grantee's subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the option shall upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "substitute option"), at the election of the holder, of either (a) the acquiring corporation (as defined in paragraph (b) below) or (b) any person that controls the acquiring corporation. (b) the following terms have the meanings indicated: (i) the term "acquiring corporation" shall mean (a) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with the issuer (if other than the issuer), (b) the issuer in a merger in which the issuer is the continuing or surviving person, and (c) the transferee of all or substantially all of the issuer's assets. (ii) the term "substitute common stock" shall mean the common stock issued by the issuer of the substitute option upon exercise of the substitute option. (iii) the term "assigned value" shall mean the "market/offer price", as defined in paragraph (a) of section 7 hereof. (iv) the term "average price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the substitute common stock for the one (1) year period immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of the substitute common stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale, provided that if the issuer is the issuer of the substitute option, the average price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into the issuer or by any company which controls such person, as the holder may elect. (c) the substitute option shall have the same terms as the option, provided that if the terms of the substitute option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the option, such terms shall, to the extent legally permissible, be as similar as possible to, and in no event less advantageous to the holder than, the terms of the option. the issuer of the substitute option shall also enter into an agreement with the then holder or holders of the substitute option in substantially the same form as this agreement, which shall be applicable to the substitute option. (d) the substitute option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of the substitute common stock as is equal to (i) the product of (a) the assigned value and (b) the number of shares of common stock for which the option is then exercisable, divided by (ii) the average price. the exercise price of the substitute option per share of the substitute common stock shall then be equal to the option price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of option shares and the denominator is the number of shares of the substitute common stock for which the substitute option is exercisable. (e) in no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the substitute option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the aggregate of the shares of the substitute common stock outstanding prior to exercise of the substitute option (without giving effect to any shares of substitute common stock issued pursuant to the substitute option) less the number of shares previously issued pursuant to the substitute option. in the event that the substitute option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of substitute common stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this paragraph (e), the issuer of the substitute option (the "substitute option issuer") shall make a cash payment to the holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the substitute option without giving effect to the limitation in this paragraph (e) over (ii) the value of the substitute option after giving effect to the limitation in this paragraph (e). the difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by a majority in interest of the holders or the owners, as the case may be. (f) the issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section 8 unless the acquiring corporation and any person that controls the acquiring corporation shall have assumed in writing all the obligations of the issuer hereunder. 9. (a) at the written request of the holder of the substitute option (the "substitute option holder"), the issuer of the substitute option (the "substitute option issuer") shall repurchase the substitute option from the substitute option holder at a price (the "substitute option repurchase price") equal to the amount by which (i) the highest closing price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the substitute option, multiplied by the number of shares of the substitute common stock for which the substitute option may then be exercised, plus to the extent not previously reimbursed, the grantee's out-of-pocket expenses, and at the request of each owner (the "substitute share owner") of shares of the substitute common stock (the "substitute shares"), the substitute option issuer shall repurchase the substitute shares at a price per share (the "substitute share repurchase price") equal to the greater of (a) the highest closing price and (b) the average exercise price per share paid by the substitute share owner for the substitute shares so designated, plus, to the extent not previously reimbursed, the grantee's out-of-pocket expenses. the term "highest closing price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of the substitute common stock within the six (6) month period immediately preceding the date the substitute option holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the substitute option or the substitute share owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the substitute shares, as applicable. (b) each substitute option holder and the substitute share owner, as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the substitute option issuer to repurchase the substitute option and the substitute shares pursuant to this section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the substitute option issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such substitute option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this agreement) and certificates for substitute shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that such substitute option holder or substitute share owner elects to require the substitute option issuer to repurchase the substitute option and/or the substitute shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 9. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) business days after the surrender of the substitute option and/or the certificates representing substitute shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the substitute option issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the substitute option holder the substitute option repurchase price and/or to the substitute share owner the substitute share repurchase price therefor, or the portion(s) thereof which the substitute option issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering. (c) to the extent that the substitute option issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, or as a result of a written agreement or other binding obligation with a governmental or regulatory body or agency, from repurchasing the substitute option and/or the substitute shares in full, the substitute option issuer shall immediately so notify each substitute option holder and/or the substitute share owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the substitute option holder and/or substitute share owner, as appropriate, that portion of the substitute option repurchase price and the substitute share repurchase price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five (5) business days after the date on which the substitute option issuer is no longer so prohibited, provided, however, that if the substitute option issuer is, at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 9 prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, or as a result of a written agreement or other binding obligation with a governmental or regulatory body or agency, from delivering to the substitute option holder and/or the substitute share owner, as appropriate, the substitute option repurchase price and the substitute share repurchase price, respectively, in part or in full (and the substitute option issuer shall use its best efforts to receive all required regulatory and legal approvals as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the substitute option holder or substitute share owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the substitute option or the substitute shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon the substitute option issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the substitute option holder or substitute share owner, as appropriate, that portion of the substitute option repurchase price or the substitute share repurchase price that the substitute option issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (a) to the substitute option holder, a new substitute option evidencing the right of the substitute option holder to purchase that number of shares of the substitute common stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the substitute common stock for which the surrendered substitute option was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the substitute option repurchase price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the substitute option holder and the denominator of which is the substitute option repurchase price, or (b) to the substitute share owner, a certificate for the substitute option shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. 10. the thirty (30) day period for exercise of certain rights under sections 2, 6, 7 and 12 hereof shall be extended in each such case: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under section 16(b) of the exchange act by reason of such exercise, provided that notice of intent to exercise such rights shall be given to the issuer within the requisite thirty (30) day period and the grantee and the holders shall use their best efforts to promptly obtain all requisite approvals and cause the expiration of all requisite waiting periods. 11. the issuer hereby represents and warrants to the grantee as follows: (a) the issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. the execution and delivery of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the board of directors of the issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the issuer are necessary to authorize this agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. this agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the issuer. this agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the issuer, enforceable against the issuer in accordance with its respective terms, except that enforcement thereof may be limited by the receivership, conservatorship and supervisory powers of bank regulatory agencies generally as well as bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that enforcement thereof may be subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the availability of equitable remedies. (b) the issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the termination of this agreement in accordance with its terms will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the option, that number of shares of common stock equal to the maximum number of shares of common stock at any time and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights. 12. neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations under this option agreement or the option created hereunder to any other person, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the express written consent of the other party, except that in the event a subsequent triggering event shall have occurred prior to an exercise termination event, the grantee may, subject to the right of first refusal set forth in section 13, assign, transfer or sell in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within thirty (30) days following such subsequent triggering event (or such later period as provided in section 10); provided, however, that in the event the grantee sells, assigns or transfers all or a portion of the option to other holders as permitted by this agreement, the grantee may exercise its rights hereunder on behalf of itself and such holders. 13. if at any time after the occurrence of a subsequent triggering event and, with respect to shares of common stock or other securities acquired by the grantee pursuant to an exercise of the option, prior to the expiration of twenty-four (24) months after the expiration of the option pursuant to section 2(b), the grantee shall desire to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of the option, in whole or in part, or all or any of the shares of common stock or other securities acquired by the grantee pursuant to the option, the grantee shall give the issuer written notice of the proposed transaction (an "offeror's notice"), identifying the proposed transferee, accompanied by a copy of a binding offer to purchase the option or such shares or other securities signed by such transferee and setting forth the terms of the proposed transaction. an offeror's notice shall be deemed an offer by the grantee to the issuer, which may be accepted within ten (10) business days of the receipt of such offeror's notice, on the same terms and conditions and at the same price at which the grantee is proposing to transfer the option or such shares or other securities to such transferee. the purchase of the option or such shares or other securities by the issuer shall be settled within five (5) business days of the date of the acceptance of the offer and the purchase price shall be paid to the grantee in immediately available funds, provided that, if prior notification to or approval, consent or waiver of the federal reserve board or any other regulatory authority is required in connection with such purchase, the issuer shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval, consent or waiver and shall expeditiously process the same (and the grantee shall cooperate with the issuer in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval) and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (a) the required notification period has expired or been terminated or (b) such approval has been obtained and, in either event, any requisite waiting period shall have passed. in the event of the failure or refusal of the issuer to purchase the option or the shares or other securities, as the case may be, covered by an offeror's notice or if the federal reserve board or any other regulatory authority disapproves the issuer's proposed purchase of the option or such shares or other securities, the grantee may, within sixty (60) days following the date of the offeror's notice (subject to any necessary extension for regulatory notification, approval, or waiting periods), sell all, but not less than all, of the portion of the option (which may be one hundred percent (100%)) or such shares or other securities, as the case may be, proposed to be transferred to the proposed transferee identified in the offeror's notice at no less than the price specified and on terms no more favorable to the proposed transferee than those set forth in the offeror's notice. the requirements of this section 13 shall not apply to (i) any disposition of the option or any shares of common stock or other securities by a person to whom the grantee has assigned its rights under the option with the prior written consent of the issuer, (ii) any sale by means of a public offering in which steps are taken to reasonably ensure that no purchaser will acquire securities representing more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the issuer or (iii) any transfer to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the grantee which agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof. 14. each of the grantee and the issuer will use all reasonable efforts to make all filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and governmental authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement, including without limitation applying to the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, for approval to acquire the shares issuable hereunder. 15. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that the holder or the owner or any related person thereof (as hereinafter defined) is a person making an offer or proposal to engage in an acquisition transaction (other than the transaction contemplated by the acquisition agreement), then (a) in the case of a holder or any related person thereof, the option held by it shall immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect, and (b) in the case of an owner or any related person thereof, the option shares held by it shall be immediately repurchasable by the issuer at the option price. for purposes of this agreement, a "related person" of a holder or owner means any affiliate (as defined in rule 12b-2 of the rules and regulations under the exchange act) of the holder or the owner and any person that is required to file a schedule 13d with the holder or the owner with respect to shares of common stock or options to acquire the common stock. 16. the parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief. 17. if any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. if for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that the holder is not permitted to acquire, or the issuer is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to section 7, the full number of shares of common stock provided in section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to sections 1(b) or 5 hereof), it is the express intention of the issuer to allow the holder to acquire or to require the issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof. 18. all notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the acquisition agreement. 19. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. 20. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 21. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel. 22. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. the terms and conditions of this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. nothing in this agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than
