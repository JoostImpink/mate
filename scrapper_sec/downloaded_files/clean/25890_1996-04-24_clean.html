dated may 22, 1995 between the issuer and compagnie generale d'industrie et de participations, the principal shareholder of carnaud metalbox ("carnaud"), the issuer acquired control of carnaud by making an offer to exchange or purchase (the "exchange offer") shares of carnaud. pursuant to the exchange offer, each share of carnaud validly tendered could be exchanged for (1) ff 225 in cash or (2) 1.086 units of the issuer, each unit consisting of (x) .75 shares of common stock of the issuer and (y) .25 shares of preferred stock of the issuer. in a series of transactions entered into by sbil with two counterparties from november 29, 1995 through january 15, 1996, sbil obtained the right (the "options") to acquire shares of carnaud stock at french francs 225 per share, which shares of carnaud stock were exchangeable pursuant to the exchange offer for, among other things, up to 610,301 shares of preferred stock. the aggregate premiums for the options paid by sbil to its counterparties was approximately french francs 4,875,878. copies of the options are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2 and incorporated by reference herein. simultaneously with entering into the options, sbil entered into transactions with sbi granting sbi identical rights to those granted to sbil pursuant to the options for identical premiums. on january 31, 1996, sbi exercised its rights with sbil, and sbil exercised the options with its counterparties, as a result of which sbi became entitled to receive, among other things, an aggregate of 610,301 shares of preferred stock when issued by the issuer pursuant to the exchange offer. the amount of funds used by sbil to exercise the options, and by sbi to exercise its rights with sbil, was approximately french francs 505,773,650. sbil received the funds used for payment upon its exercise from the payment received from sbi upon its exercise of its rights. sbi's funds came from its working capital, which in the normal course includes the proceeds from day loans and demand loans entered into in the ordinary course of business with numerous banks. such demand loans are secured virtually entirely by securities owned by sbi. on february 1, 1996, sbil tendered a portion of the shares of stock of carnaud owned by it pursuant to the exchange offer and elected to receive units in exchange that included 777,750 shares of preferred stock. on february 15, 1996, the issuer announced the results of the exchange offer and that the exchange would take place on february 26, 1996. the final settlement date on which the exchange occurred and the preferred stock was issued was february 26, 1996. the effective cost to sbil for acquiring the shares of carnaud it submitted in the exchange offer exchanged for 777,750 shares of preferred stock is estimated to have been approximately french francs 157,611,623. these funds came from sbil's working capital, which in the normal course includes the proceeds from day loans and demand loans entered into in the ordinary course of business with numerous banks. such demand loans are secured virtually entirely by securities owned by sbil. item 4. purpose of transaction. the preferred stock to which this statement relates was acquired by sbi and sbil in the ordinary course of its business in connection with its investment and arbitrage activities. sbi and sbil at any time or from time to time may (i) acquire, or agree to acquire, or acquire put or call options relating to, additional shares of preferred stock or other securities of the issuer, (ii) sell, or agree to sell, or sell put or call options relating to, some or all of such shares of preferred stock or other securities of the issuer, in each such case in the open market, in negotiated transactions, or otherwise, (iii) convert preferred stock owned by sbi or sbil, respectively, into shares of common stock of the issuer, (iv) make or receive proposals and enter into negotiations with respect to such transactions and/or (iv) surrender such shares of preferred stock or such other securities of the issuer owned by sbi or sbil, respectively, in connection with any merger, tender offer or other acquisition transaction involving the issuer. sbi's and sbil's decisions in such regard will be based upon the prevailing price of the preferred stock or other such securities in the open market and/or in any negotiated transactions, the value of any consideration being offered in any merger, tender offer or other acquisition transaction involving the securities of the issuer, tax considerations and any other relevant factors. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.

(2) if an event of default has occurred and is then continuing in respect of the defaulting party, the other party (the "non- defaulting party") may, by notice to the defaulting party, terminate the transaction evidenced by this confirmation and may terminate any other transaction between the non- defaulting party and the defaulting party (each, an "other transaction") on the date specified in such notice (the "early termination date"). upon the effectiveness of such notice the obligations of the parties to make any further payments on the settlement date will cease, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this confirmation. (3) on the early termination date the non-defaulting party will, in a commercially reasonable manner, determine its replacement cost, or, if such replacement cost is not ascertainable, its net loss (such replacement cost or net loss, the "replacement value") in u.s. dollars as a result of the early termination of this transaction and each other transaction that has been terminated pursuant to clause (2) above or clause (6) below. the replacement value of any other transaction shall be determined in accordance with the documentation applicable thereto, or, if no such documentation exists or if the relevant documentation does not provide for the determination of damages upon insolvency or default, the replacement value of such other transaction shall be determined as provided herein. in determining replacement value, (a) losses and costs to the non- defaulting party shall be expressed as positive numbers, and gains to the non-defaulting party shall be expressed as negative numbers, (b) the non-defaulting party may convert any amount to u.s. dollars and (c) the non-defaulting party may take into consideration any (i) loss of bargain (including the cost of replacing the relevant position), (ii) cost of funding, (iii) loss or cost associated with unwinding or reestablishing a hedge or related trading position and (iv) amounts due and payable by either party prior to the early termination date. the non-defaulting party will provide to the defaulting party, as soon as reasonably practicable following the early termination date, a statement showing in reasonable detail (i) each replacement value calculated hereunder, and (ii) the sum of all such replacement values (such sum, the "early termination amount"). (4) the non-defaulting party may treat security for any transaction between the defaulting party and the non- defaulting party as security for all such transactions, including any other transactions. (5) the defaulting party will pay the early termination amount to the non-defaulting party or the non- defaulting party will pay the early termination amount to the defaulting party as the case may be on the first new york banking day after the defaulting party receives notice of the early termination amount. (6) in addition to any rights of set-off a party may have as a matter of law or otherwise, if the non-defaulting party is required to make a payment in accordance with the events of default provided herein, it shall have the right (but shall not be obliged) to set off any obligation (as defined below) of the defaulting party, to the non- defaulting party against any obligation (as defined below) of the non-defaulting party to the defaulting party. for the purpose of cross-currency set-off, the non-defaulting party may convert any obligation to another currency at a market rate reasonably determined by the non- defaulting party. an "obligation" of a party means any obligation, matured or unmatured, contingent or otherwise, owed by that party to the other party whether or not arising under this confirmation. (7) the defaulting party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the non-defaulting party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including attorneys' fees, incurred by the non-defaulting party by reason of its enforcement of and protection of its rights under this transaction.
