court square paid for the transferred shares from citicorp venture capital ltd., an affiliate of court square, for $10.50 per share, subject to adjustment. court square expects the certificates for the transferred shares to be made in court square's name shortly. court square contemplates conveying the transferred shares to chase as a capital contribution pursuant to the contribution agreement. the total amount of funds required for chase to purchase the tender shares (the "offer"), to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of common stock through a subsequent cash merger (the "proposed merger"), and to pay fees and expenses related thereto is estimated to be approximately $105,000,000. chase plans to obtain all funds needed for the offer and proposed merger through borrowings under two credit facilities with one or more commercial banks in respect of which chase has obtained two commitment letters (the "pnc commitment letters") from pnc bank, national association ("pnc") providing for a $30,000,000 senior secured tender offer credit facility (the "tender facility") and a $120,000,000 aggregate senior secured credit facility comprised of two revolving credit facilities, two term loans and an equipment line (the "merger facilities" and, together with the tender facility, the "credit facilities"). the pnc commitment letters indicate the bank's willingness to provide funding on customary terms and conditions. the offer will be financed in part pursuant to the tender facility, with the proposed merger being financed in part pursuant to the merger facilities, under which the company, as the surviving corporation in the proposed merger (the "surviving corporation"), will be the borrower. as used herein, "borrower" refers to chase under the tender facility and the company, as the surviving corporation in the proposed merger, under the merger facilities. proceeds of the tender facility may be used to finance the purchase of the tender shares, to pay up to six months interest on the tender facility and to pay fees and expenses of the tender offer. proceeds of the merger facilities may be used (i) to refinance the borrowings of chase under the tender facility, (ii) to finance the payment of the consideration payable in the proposed merger to holders of the capital stock of the company, (iii) to refinance existing indebtedness of the company, and (iv) the payment of the fees and expenses of the proposed merger and the offer. in addition, the proceeds -9- under the revolving credit portion of the merger facilities may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. any debt incurred to fund the purchase of the tender shares in the offer is expected to be repaid upon the earlier of (i) nine months from the date on which the offer was made, (ii) six months after the first draw under the tender facility, or (iii) the date on which the proposed merger is effective. based upon the commitment letters and related term sheets, the credit facilities will contain restrictive covenants that limit the borrower with respect to, among other things, creating liens upon its assets and disposing of material amounts of assets other than in the ordinary course of business. the borrower will also be required to meet certain financial tests under the credit facilities. obligations under the tender facility will be secured by a perfected first priority security interest in all securities of the company owned by chase, whether acquired in the offer or otherwise. the merger facilities will be guaranteed by each existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiary of the borrower (the "guarantors") and secured by substantially all present and future assets of the borrower and the guarantors, other than the assets of the foreign subsidiaries of the borrower. chase may terminate or amend the offer and may postpone the acceptance for payment of and payment for the tender shares or the shares to be purchased pursuant to the proposed merger if chase does not receive sufficient financing, on terms at least as favorable to chase as are contained in the pnc commitment letters, to pay the aggregate consideration payable in connection with the offer , and not satisfied that it will have funding available following the offer sufficient to fund the proposed merger and the ongoing working capital needs of the borrower (it being agreed that chase will use reasonable commercial efforts to consummate the financing pursuant to the pnc commitment letters, subject to satisfactory documentation in chase's reasonable discretion). except for the shares of common stock directly beneficially owned by court square, all interests, direct and indirect, in the common stock reported in this schedule 13d were acquired by certain subsidiaries of citigroup for managed accounts with funds provided by third party customers. item 4. purpose of transaction. general. the purpose of the offer is to acquire control of, and ultimately the entire equity interest in, the company. chase presently intends, as soon as practicable after consummation of the offer to seek to have the company consummate the proposed merger. at the effective time of the proposed merger, each share of common stock and each share of non-voting stock (collectively, the "shares") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the proposed merger (other than shares owned by chase) would be converted into an amount in cash equal to the highest price per share paid in the offer. court square and chase currently intend to pursue the proposed merger following consummation of the offer. however, as court square and chase are seeking to negotiate with respect to the acquisition of the company, court square and chase reserve the right to amend the terms of the proposed merger or to pursue an alternative second-step business combination transaction involving the company in which the shares not owned by chase would be converted into or exchanged for cash, shares of chase common stock and/or other securities or consideration. the timing of consummation of the offer and the proposed merger will depend on a variety of factors and legal requirements, the actions of the board of directors of the company, the number of shares (if any) acquired by chase pursuant to the offer, and whether the conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived. certain terms of the related rights to purchase shares of junior participating preferred stock of the company (the "rights") and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl") may affect the ability of chase to obtain control of the company and to cause chase to consummate the proposed merger. a condition to implementing the proposed merger is that chase be satisfied that section 203 of the dgcl is not an impediment to the consummation of the proposed merger. chase believes that, if the rights have been redeemed by the board of directors of the company or if chase is satisfied, in its sole discretion, that the rights have been invalidated or are otherwise inapplicable to the offer and the proposed merger and if the financing condition as described in item 3 and the condition set forth above are satisfied, it should be able to implement the proposed merger. nevertheless, chase can give no assurance that the proposed merger will be consummated or as to the timing of the proposed merger if it is consummated. the offer -10- and the proposed merger are subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals and receipt of the financing on the terms outlined in the pnc commitment letters, and approval of the company's board of directors. effects of the offer and the proposed merger. if the offer and the proposed merger are consummated, immediately following the proposed merger, (1) court square, (2) robert f. b. logan, who is currently a minority stockholder of chase ("mr. logan"), and (3) certain management investors who may decide to invest directly in chase will collectively own all the equity interests of the company (provided that following the proposed merger if pnc elects to exercise its right to invest in the company pursuant to the financing terms, then pnc may own an equity interest in the company) and will be entitled to all benefits resulting from such interests, including all income generated by the company's operations and any future increase in the company's value. similarly, such parties will bear the risk of losses generated by the company's operations and any future decrease in the value of the company after the proposed merger. subsequent to the proposed merger, the stockholders who tendered into the offer and the stockholders who were cashed out in the proposed merger (collectively, the "public stockholders") will cease to have an equity interest in the company, will not have the opportunity to participate in the earnings and growth of the company after the proposed merger and will not face the risk of losses generated by the company's operations or decline in the value of the company after the proposed merger. accordingly, the public stockholders will not have the opportunity to participate in the earnings and growth of the company after the consummation of the proposed merger and will not have any right to vote on corporate matters. in addition, the public stockholders will not be entitled to share in any premium which might be payable by an unrelated third-party acquiror of all of the shares in a sale transaction, if any, occurring after the consummation of the proposed merger. no such transactions are contemplated at this time. however, such public stockholders will not face the risk of losses generated by the company's operations or any decrease in the value of the company after the consummation of the proposed merger. plans for the company after the offer and the proposed merger. upon consummation of the proposed merger, the company will become a privately held corporation. the shares are currently listed for quotation on the new york stock exchange. however, as a result of the proposed merger and following consummation of the proposed merger, the company will be entirely owned by court square, mr. logan and certain management investors who may decide to invest directly in chase (provided that following the proposed merger if pnc elects to exercise its right to invest in the company pursuant to the financing terms, then pnc may also own an equity interest in the company), and there will be no public market for the shares. following the consummation of the proposed merger, the shares will no longer be quoted on the new york stock exchange and chase intends to terminate the registration of the shares under the act. accordingly, after the proposed merger there will be no publicly traded equity securities of the company. moreover, after the proposed merger, the company may deregister the shares in which event the company will no longer be legally required to file periodic reports with the commission, under the act (although it may continue to do so if contractually required under any agreements governing its indebtedness or indebtedness of its subsidiaries), and will no longer be required to comply with the proxy rules of regulation 14a under section 14 under the act. in addition, the company's officers, directors and stockholders who beneficially own 10% or more of the shares will be relieved of the reporting requirements and restrictions on "short-swing" trading contained in section 16 of the act with respect to the shares. it is expected that, if shares are not accepted for payment by chase pursuant to the offer and the merger is not consummated, the company's current management, under the general direction of the company's board of directors, will continue to manage the company as an ongoing business. upon consummation of the proposed merger, chase and court square intend to have the board of directors of the surviving corporation consists of mr. logan, thomas f. mcwilliams ("mr. mcwilliams") and charles e. corpening. chase and court square also intend to designate mr. logan as the president and chief executive officer of the surviving corporation in the proposed merger. chase and court square do not anticipate making any other changes in management. -11- the company and martin v. alonzo ("mr. alonzo") are parties to an employment agreement dated as of november 10, 1994 (the "employment agreement"). pursuant to the employment agreement, the company agreed to employ mr. alonzo as its chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. upon the consummation of the proposed merger, chase and court square intend to terminate the employment agreement. if the employment agreement is terminated, the company may be required to pay severance to mr. alonzo in the amounts and in the manner specified by the employment agreement. the company also recently announced that it has engaged robinson- humphrey, a subsidiary of salomon smith barney inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of citigroup, to review all strategic alternatives for the company's subsidiary leavitt tube company, including the sale of leavitt tube. after the consummation of the offer and the proposed merger, chase and court square intend to continue to pursue the evaluation of strategic alternatives for leavitt tube, including the sale of such subsidiary or its assets. in connection with the offer and the proposed merger, court square and chase have reviewed, and will continue to review, various possible business strategies that they might consider in the event that chase acquires control of the company. in addition, if and to the extent that chase acquires control of the company, court square and chase intend to conduct a detailed review of the company and its assets, financial projections, corporate structure, dividend policy, capitalization, operations, properties, policies, management and personnel and consider and determine what, if any, changes would

charles: it is our understanding that citicorp venture capital, through an affiliate entity chase acquisition corporation, (both collectively referred to herein as citicorp venture capital), proposes to purchase all the capital stock of chase industries, inc. ("chase" or the "company") not presently beneficially owned by citicorp venture capital via a tender offer at an aggregate purchase price of $27,000,000 and a subsequent merger of chase with chase acquisition or a subsidiary thereof ("new chase"). in order to refinance the tender credit facility (the "tender facility") described in the commitment letter dated this date and issued to you in connection with the tender offer (as defined in the summary), to refinance certain existing indebtedness of chase, to finance the continuing operations of new chase (as defined in summary) (including but not limited to certain capital expenditures made pursuant to the company's project 400 initiative) and to provide financing until the liquidation of chase's leavitt tube company, inc. ("leavitt") subsidiary (the "leavitt divestiture"), new chase will require up to $120 million in post-merger credit facilities (the "financing"). we are pleased to inform you that pnc bank, national association ("pnc bank" or "bank") commits to underwrite the entire amount of the financing described in the attached summary of terms and conditions (the "summary"), subject to the terms and conditions referred to in this letter and the summary. the summary includes a description of the principal terms of the proposed credit facilities connected with the financing, and is intended as a framework for the documentation and as a basis for further discussion of the financing's terms, as appropriate. the financing will be documented in a definitive credit agreement (the "credit agreement") and other agreements, instruments, certificates, and documents called for by the credit agreement or which the bank may otherwise require (collectively, the "credit documents"), to be delivered at the closing of the financing (the "closing"). the terms of the credit documents shall prevail over the terms of this letter. pnc bank's obligations are conditioned on the execution and delivery of the credit documents to the bank in form and content satisfactory to the bank. because not all of the terms can be set forth in the summary, a failure by the bank or new chase to agree on the definitive terms of the credit documents will not constitute a breach of this commitment. this letter is also subject to acceptance by citicorp venture capital as provided below and the statutory and other requirements under which the bank is governed. in addition to the terms and conditions set forth in the summary, pnc bank's commitment to provide the proposed financing is further subject to: (i) there being no material adverse change in the financial condition, business, operations, properties, or prospects of the company from the information provided to the bank in its due diligence process; (ii) the company's leverage (debt/ebitda) not exceeding 2.75x at closing of the merger and (iii) funding under the financing not to exceed $100,000,000 at closing of the merger. this letter is issued in reliance on the information provided to the bank by citicorp venture capital in connection with the citicorp venture capital's request for the financing and the information in any supporting document and material. pnc bank may terminate this commitment if there is any material misrepresentation or material inaccuracy in the information or any failure to include material information with the request. this commitment letter may not be assigned by citicorp venture capital other than by citicorp venture capital, ltd. to any wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup, inc. and no rights of citicorp venture capital hereunder may be transferred without the prior written consent of pnc bank. prior to or after execution of definitive documentation for the financing, the bank reserves the right and may elect to (a) syndicate all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder so that the assignee may become a party to the credit agreement and (b) arrange for the sale of participation interests in its commitment hereunder and/or loans made by it as contemplated hereby. in the event of any assignment referred to in (a) above, the assignor shall be released of all obligations assumed by the assignee. pnc capital markets will manage all aspects of the syndication, including the selection of lenders, the determination of when pnc capital markets will approach potential lenders, titles for the lenders and the final allocations of the commitments among the lenders, the selection, title and allocations of such lenders to be subject to prior consultation with citicorp venture capital. pnc bank and any assignees or participants will in no event be responsible or liable for any consequential damages that may be incurred or alleged by any person as a result of this commitment. no modification or waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this commitment will be valid and binding unless agreed to in writing by pnc bank. when accepted, this letter constitutes the entire agreement between pnc bank and citicorp venture capital concerning the financing and replaces all prior understandings, statements and negotiations. pnc bank's commitment hereunder will expire on december 27, 2000, unless on or before that date citicorp venture capital signs and returns the enclosed copy of this letter. once accepted, pnc bank's commitment under this letter will expire on the earlier of (i) six months from the initial funding of the tender facility if the financing has not closed on or before that date, or (ii) the date on which the commitment letter provided by pnc bank in connection with the tender facility shall expire or otherwise terminate (if such commitment letter shall expire or otherwise terminate prior to funding of such tender

(e) priority on demand registrations. if the holder(s) requesting a -------------------------------- demand registration ("demanding holder(s)") so requests (or if more than one ------------------- demand holder, if the demanding holders owning a majority of the registrable securities requested to be included in the demand regulation by the demanding holders so requests (the "majority demanding holders")), the offering of -------------------------- registrable securities pursuant to a demand registration shall be in 4 the form of an underwritten offering. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering notify the company that, in good faith, they are able to proceed with the proposed offering only with respect to a smaller number of shares of registrable securities proposed to be offered by the demanding holder, then the company will include in such registration the total number of securities recommended by such managing underwriter or underwriters, and such amount shall be allocated (i) first, subject to any written agreement among the demanding holders, to and among the demanding holders on a pro rata basis and (ii) second, to and among the other holders requesting to participate in the demand registration pursuant to section 3 hereof on a pro rata basis. (f) selection of underwriters. if a demand registration is in the ------------------------- form of an underwritten offering, the majority demanding holders shall select the managing underwriter or underwriters to be used in connection with the offering; provided, however, that such underwriter or underwriters must be --------- ------- reasonably satisfactory to the company. 3. piggy-back registration. ----------------------- (a) request for registration. at any time after the date hereof, if ------------------------ the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 (or any successor form that may be adopted by the commission) or a registration statement filed in connection with an exchange offer or offering of securities or debt solely to the company's existing security or debt holders) with respect to an offering of any class of equity securities by the company for its own account or for the account of any of its security holders, then the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to each holder as soon as practicable (but in no event less than 20 days before the anticipated filing date). such notice shall offer each holder the opportunity to have all or any of the registrable securities held by such holder included in the registration statement proposed to be filed or, at the company's option, in a separate registration statement to be filed concurrently with such registration statement (the "piggy-back registration"). within 10 days after receiving such notice, each holder may make a written request to the company that any or all of the holder's registrable securities be included in the piggy-back registration, which notice shall specify the number of shares to be so included. subject to section 3(b) hereof, the company shall include in the piggy-back registration (or in a separate registration statement filed concurrently therewith) all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein within ten days after the receipt by each holder of the company's notice. the company may in its discretion withdraw any registration statement filed pursuant to this section 3(a) subsequent to its filing without liability to the holders except with respect to expenses. any holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of the registrable securities from a piggy-back registration at any time prior to the effective date of such piggy-back registration. (b) priority on piggy-back registration. if any piggy-back ----------------------------------- registration is to be an underwritten offering, the company shall use its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters to permit the shares of registrable securities requested by the 5 holders of registrable securities ("selling piggy-back holders") to be included -------------------------- in the piggy-back registration (on the same terms and conditions as similar securities of the company included therein to the extent appropriate). notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering notify the company that, in good faith, they are able to proceed with the proposed offering only with respect to a smaller number of shares of registrable securities proposed to be offered by the selling piggy-back holders, then (i) if such piggy-back registration is incident to a primary registration on behalf of the company, then the amount of securities to be included in the piggy-back registration for any persons (other than the company and the selling piggy-back holders) shall first be reduced, and thereafter the registrable securities to be offered for the account of the selling piggy-back holders shall be reduced or limited, subject to any written agreement among the selling piggy- back holders, on a pro rata basis so that the total number of securities to be included in the offering shall be the total number of securities recommended by such managing underwriter or underwriters and (ii) if such piggy-back registration is incident to a secondary registration on behalf of holders of securities of the company (including pursuant to section 2 hereof), the company shall include in such registration statement (a) first, the number of securities of such person(s) on whose behalf the registration is being made (allocated among such persons as they may so determine, subject to section 2(e), if applicable), (b) second, the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration pursuant to this section 3 in excess of the securities such persons on whose behalf the registration is being made propose to sell that, in the opinion of such managing underwriters, can be sold without materially and adversely affecting such offering, allocated among the selling piggy-back holders, subject to any written agreement among the selling piggy- back holders on a pro rata basis, and (c) third, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration by the company or by other persons pursuant to similar piggy-back registration rights (allocated among the company and such persons as they may so determine). 4. holdback agreements. ------------------- (a) restrictions on public sale by holder of registrable securities. --------------------------------------------------------------- upon inclusion by the company of any holder's registrable securities in a registration statement filed pursuant to sections 2 or 3 hereof, such holder agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of the issue being registered or a similar security of the company or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 or rule 144a under the securities act, during the 14 days prior to, and during the 120 day period beginning on, the effective date of such registration statement (except as part of such registration), if and to the extent requested by the company in the case of a non-underwritten public offering or if and to the extent requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters in the case of an underwritten public offering. (b) restrictions on public sale by the company. the company agrees ------------------------------------------ (i) that it shall not effect any public or private sale or distribution of securities of the nature of the registrable securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for securities of the nature of the registrable securities (except pursuant to a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 or any successor form that may be adopted by the commission), during the 6 14 days prior to, and during the 120 day period beginning on, the effective date of any demand registration statement other than a shelf registration and (ii) that any agreement entered into after the date hereof pursuant to which the company agrees to issue any securities, the issuance of which is not registered under the securities act, shall contain a provision under which holders of such securities agree not to effect any public sale or distribution of any such securities during the periods described in clause (i) above, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 or rule 144a under the securities act; provided, however, --------- ------- that the provisions of this subsection (b) shall not prevent the grant of options or similar rights to employees of the company pursuant to the company's 1994 long-term incentive plan. 5. registration procedures. ----------------------- subject to the other provisions and limitations contained in this agreement, whenever any holder has requested that any registrable securities be registered pursuant to sections 2 or 3 hereof, the company will use its best efforts to effect the registration and the sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof as quickly as practicable, and in connection with any such request, the company will as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies or which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of the registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use its best efforts to cause such filed registration statement to become effective under the securities act; provided, however, that, (i) at least five days before filing a registration - --------- ------- statement or prospectus or as promptly as practicable prior to filing any amendments or supplements thereto, the company will furnish to one counsel selected by the holder or holders of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review of such counsel, and (ii) after the filing of the registration statement, the company will promptly notify each such holder and such counsel of comments received from, or any stop order issued or threatened by, the commission and take all reasonable actions required to respond to such comments or, as the case may be, prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if it has been entered; (b) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for the applicable period required by the terms hereof, which will terminate when all registrable securities covered by such registration statement have been sold or, in the case of piggy-back registrations pursuant to section 3, for such time period as the company shall determine in its sole discretion (but not before the expiration of the 90-day period referred to in subsection 4(3) of the securities act and rule 174 thereunder, if applicable) and comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition as set forth in such registration statement; 7 (c) furnish to each holder of registrable securities covered by such registration statement, prior to filing the registration statement, if requested, copies of such registration statement as proposed to be filed, and thereafter furnish to each such holder such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus), and such other documents as each such holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by each such holder; (d) use its best efforts to register or qualify such registrable securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as each holder of registrable securities covered by such registration statement reasonably (in light of each such holder's intended plan of distribution) requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary to enable each such holder to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the registrable securities owned by each such holder and keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period such registration statement is effective; provided, however, --------- ------- that the company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subsection, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; (e) use its best efforts to cause such registrable securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the company to enable each holder of registrable securities covered by the registration statement to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities;

(g) enter into and perform customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any), use its best efforts to obtain any necessary consents in connection with any proposed registration and 8 sale of registrable securities, and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such registrable securities; (h) make available for inspection by each holder of registrable securities covered by the registration statement, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney, accountant, or other professional retained by any such holder or such underwriter (collectively, the "inspectors"), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents, and properties of the company (collectively, the "records") as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the company's officers, directors, and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such inspectors in connection with such registration statement. records which the company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies the inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the inspectors unless (i) in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the company the disclosure of such records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in such registration statement or (ii) the release of such records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction. each holder agrees that information obtained by him as a result of such inspections shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by him as the basis for any market transactions in the securities of the company unless and until such is made generally available to the public. each holder further agrees that he will, upon learning that disclosure of such records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the company and allow the company, at the company's expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the records deemed confidential; (i) if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten offering, use its best efforts to obtain a comfort letter or comfort letters from the company's independent public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by comfort letters as any holder of registrable securities covered by the registration statement or the managing underwriter or underwriters may reasonably request;

provided, however, that the company shall not be required to take any --------- ------- actions pursuant to this section 5(k) that are not, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the company, in compliance with applicable law; and (l) use its reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement filed in connection herewith, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest possible moment;

and enable such registrable securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriters, if any, or holders may request at least two business days prior to any sale of registrable securities; (n) take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such registrable securities. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 5, the company shall be entitled to postpone, for a reasonable period of time, the filing or effectiveness of any registration statement under sections 2 or 3 if (a) the company determines, in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment, that such registration and offering could materially interfere with bona fide financing, acquisition, or other material business plans of the company (including a proposed primary offering by the company of its own securities) or would require disclosure of non-public information, the premature disclosure of which could materially adversely affect the business, properties, operations or financial results of the company; provided, however, that the --------- ------- company shall not be required to disclose to the holders requesting registration any such transaction, plan or non-public information or (b) at any time prior to the effectiveness of any demand registration or piggy-back registration the company determines that it is unable to comply with the provisions of article 3 or article 11 of regulation s-x under the securities act, to the extent then applicable to the company. if the company postpones the filing of a registration statement pursuant hereto, it shall promptly notify in writing the holders of registrable securities requesting such registration when the events or circumstances permitting such postponement have ended and at such time shall proceed with the filing of the registration statement as requested. if the company shall postpone the filing of a registration statement pursuant hereto, then the holders of registrable securities demanding such registration shall have the right to withdraw their request for registration by giving written notice to the company at any time within five days after the date the company notifies such holders of registrable securities of its willingness to proceed with the filing of the registration statement and, if such registration was to be made pursuant to a demand registration, upon such withdrawal the withdrawn demand will not count as a demand registration. 10 the company may require each holder to promptly furnish in writing to the company such information regarding the distribution of the registrable securities as the company may from time to time reasonably request and such other information as may be legally required in connection with such registration. each holder requesting registration of registrable securities pursuant to sections 2 or 3 of this agreement shall cooperate with the company and, if applicable, the underwriter or underwriters in providing such information and executing and delivering such documents as the company or the underwriter or underwriters reasonably shall request in connection with any such registration, and the company shall not be obligated to include in any such registration any registrable securities of any holder who does not comply with this paragraph. each holder of registrable securities covered by a registration statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in subsection 5(f) hereof, such holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such registrable securities until such holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subsection 5(f) hereof, and, if so directed by the company, such holder will deliver to the company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such registrable securities at the time of receipt of such notice. if the company shall give such notice, the company shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective (including the period referred to in subsection 5(b) hereof) by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of notice pursuant to subsection 5(f) hereof to the date when the company shall make available to such holder a prospectus supplemented or amended to conform with the requirements of subsection 5(f) hereof. 6. registration expenses. --------------------- in connection with any registration statement required to be filed hereunder, the company shall pay the following registration expenses (the "registration expenses"): (i) all registration and filing fees;

provided, however, that with respect --------- ------- to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary or final prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to the extent that any such losses result from the fact that a current copy of the prospectus was not sent or given to the person asserting any such losses at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities concerned to such person if it is determined that it was the responsibility of such holder to provide such person with a current copy of the prospectus and such current copy of the prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses. the company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors, and each person who controls such underwriters within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act on substantially the same basis as the indemnification of holders provided in this subsection 7(a). (b) indemnification by holders. each holder agrees to indemnify and -------------------------- hold harmless the company, its directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act (other than the holder), covered by a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement from and against any and all losses arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any such registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the 12 statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses arise out of, or are based upon, any such untrue statement or omission or allegation thereof based upon information furnished in writing to the company by such holder or on such holder's behalf, in such holder's capacity as a holder and not in his capacity as a director or officer of the company, if applicable, expressly for use therein provided, however, that with respect to any untrue statement or --------- ------- omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary or final prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to the extent that any such losses result from the fact that a current copy of the prospectus was not sent or given to the person asserting any such losses at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the common stock concerned to such person if it is determined that it was the responsibility of the company or any other person or entity (other than the holder) to provide such person with a current copy of the prospectus and such current copy of the prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses. each holder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors, and each person who controls such underwriters within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act on substantially the same basis as the indemnification of the company provided in this subsection 7(b). (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any action or -------------------------------------- proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnification under subsections (a) or (b) above (an "indemnified party") in respect of which indemnity may be sought from any party who has agreed to provide such indemnification (an "indemnifying party"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing, and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and shall assume the payment of all expenses. the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to promptly assume the defense of such action or proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, (iii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there is a conflict of interest on the part of counsel employed by the indemnifying party to represent such indemnified party, or (iv) the indemnified party's counsel shall have advised the indemnified party that there may be defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party and that the indemnifying party is not able to assert on behalf of or in the name of the indemnified party (in which case of either (iii) or (iv), if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party); it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, 13 be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by such indemnified parties. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section ------------ 7 is unavailable to the indemnified parties in respect of any losses (other than by reason of exceptions provided in subsection 7(a) or 7(b)), then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and holders (together with any other selling stockholders that may be obligated thereon pursuant to similar indemnification or contribution provisions as contained herein), on the other hand, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and holders (together with any other selling stockholders that may be obligated thereon pursuant to similar indemnification or contribution provisions as contained herein), on the other hand, from the offering of the securities covered by such registration statement. the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of holders (together with any other selling stockholders that may be obligated thereon pursuant to similar indemnification or contribution provisions as contained herein) on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party, and such party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the relative benefits received by the company on the one hand and holders (together with any other selling stockholders that may be obligated thereon pursuant to similar indemnification or contribution provisions as contained herein) on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the company bears to the total proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the holders (together with any other selling stockholders that may be obligated thereon pursuant to similar indemnification or contribution provisions as contained herein). the company and each holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding subsection. notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection 7(d), no holder shall 14 be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which securities of such holder were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of subsection 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
