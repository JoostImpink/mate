(3) based upon 21,934,834 shares of netopia common stock outstanding after the issuance of 3,545,398 shares of netopia common stock upon the exercise of the option described in items 3 and 4 below, and the issuance of 653,578 shares of netopia common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options which are either vested or will vest within 60 days of january 23, 2001. item 1. security and issuer this statement on schedule 13d (this "statement") relates to the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of netopia, inc., a delaware corporation ("netopia" or "issuer"). the principal executive

of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree, or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. to the knowledge of proxim, except as set forth on schedule a hereto, each of the individuals set forth on schedule a hereto is a citizen of the united states. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization, dated as of january 23, 2001, a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit 1 (the "merger agreement"), by and among proxim, alk acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of proxim ("merger sub"), and netopia, and subject to the conditions set forth therein (including adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger by stockholders of netopia, approval of the issuance of shares of proxim common stock by stockholders of proxim and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals), merger sub will merge with and into netopia and netopia will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of proxim (such events constituting the "merger"). at the effective time of the merger, merger sub will cease to exist as a corporation and all of the business, assets, liabilities and obligations of merger sub will be merged with and into netopia, with netopia remaining as the surviving corporation (sometimes referred to herein as the "surviving corporation"). as an inducement to proxim to enter into the merger agreement and in consideration thereof, proxim and netopia entered into a stock option agreement, dated as of january 23, 2001, a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit 2 (the "stock option agreement"), pursuant to which netopia granted proxim an irrevocable option (the "option") to acquire, subject to certain conditions, up to a number of shares of netopia common stock equal to 19.99% of the issued and outstanding netopia common stock as of january 23, 2001, or 3,545,398 shares (subject to adjustment based on an increase or decrease in the issued and outstanding netopia common stock), for a purchase price of $11.08 per share. netopia's obligation to issue shares to proxim pursuant to the exercise of the option is subject to the occurrence of certain events described in item 4 below, which may not occur. the granting of the option was negotiated as a material term of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. proxim did not pay additional consideration to netopia in connection with the stock option agreement or the granting of the option by netopia. in the event the option becomes exercisable, proxim anticipates that it will use working capital to fund the exercise price of the option. as a further inducement to proxim to enter into the merger agreement and in consideration thereof, certain officers and directors of netopia (collectively, the "stockholders") entered into individual voting agreements with proxim, a copy of the form of which is attached hereto as exhibit 3 (each, a "voting agreement" and, collectively, the "voting agreements"), whereby each stockholder agreed, severally and not jointly, to vote all of the shares of netopia common stock beneficially owned by such stockholder in favor of adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and certain related matters. proxim did not pay additional consideration to any stockholder in connection with the execution and delivery of the voting agreements. references to, and descriptions of, the merger, the merger agreement, the stock option agreement and the voting agreements set forth herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the merger agreement, the stock option agreement and the voting agreements included as exhibits 1, 2, and 3, respectively, to this statement, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety where such references and descriptions appear. 5 schedule 13d page 5 of 8 item 4: purpose of transaction (a)-(b) as described in item 3 above, this statement relates to the acquisition of netopia by proxim pursuant to a statutory merger of merger sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of proxim, with and into netopia, pursuant to which, at the effective time of the merger, the separate existence of merger sub will cease and netopia will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of proxim. by virtue of the merger, each holder of outstanding shares of netopia common stock will receive, in exchange for each share of netopia common stock held by such holder, 0.3 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of proxim ("proxim common stock"). in connection with the merger, proxim will also assume each outstanding option to purchase netopia common stock under netopia's existing stock option plans with an exercise price per share of less than $14.87, and thereafter, each such option will represent the right to acquire a number of shares of proxim common stock, as adjusted based on the exchange ratio, with the exercise price adjusted accordingly. also in connection with the merger, each purchase right under netopia's employee stock purchase plan will be exercised, and each share of netopia common stock issued as a result thereof will be converted into the right to receive 0.3 shares of proxim common stock. pursuant to the stock option agreement, netopia granted proxim the option to acquire, subject to certain conditions, up to a number of shares of netopia common stock equal to 19.99% of the issued and outstanding netopia common stock as of january 23, 2001, or 3,545,398 shares (subject to adjustments based on an increase or decrease in the issued and outstanding netopia common stock), for a purchase price of $11.08 per share. netopia's obligation to issue shares to proxim pursuant to the exercise of the option is subject to the occurrence of certain events (each, an "exercise event"), which may not occur. in general, an exercise event may be deemed to have occurred if the merger agreement is terminated because: (a) (i) the board of directors of netopia withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of this merger agreement, or the merger, in a manner adverse to proxim or its stockholders, (ii) the board of directors of netopia recommends to its stockholders an acquisition proposal (as defined in the merger agreement), (iii) netopia fails to comply, in all material respects, with any of the terms of section 5.4 of the merger agreement (relating to the non-solicitation of alternative transactions), (iv) an acquisition proposal is announced or otherwise becomes publicly known and the board of directors of netopia (x) fails to recommend against acceptance of such by its stockholders (including by taking no position, or indicating its inability to take a position, with respect to the acceptance by its stockholders of an acquisition proposal involving a tender offer or exchange offer) or (y) fails to reconfirm its approval and recommendation of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein within five (5) business days thereafter, or (vi) the board of directors of netopia resolves to take any of the actions described above; or (b) (i) the merger shall not have been consummated by june 30, 2001 for any reason (provided, however, that the right to terminate the merger agreement at such date shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes (x) a material breach of this agreement or (y) a material acquisition or proposed acquisition by proxim), or (ii) the required approval of the stockholders of netopia contemplated by the merger agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a meeting of netopia stockholders, or (iii) the required approval by the stockholders of proxim of the share issuance (as defined in the merger agreement) required under applicable nasdaq rules shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a meeting of proxim stockholders, and (x) prior to the date of termination of the merger agreement, there shall exist or have been publicly proposed a bona fide acquisition proposal relating to a company acquisition (as defined in the merger agreement) with a person or group reasonably capable of consummating a company acquisition and (y) within 12 months after the termination of the merger agreement a company acquisition is consummated or netopia enters into a definitive agreement therefor. pursuant to the voting agreements, each of the stockholders has irrevocably appointed the directors of proxim as such stockholder's lawful attorneys and proxies with respect to certain prescribed matters related to the merger. the foregoing proxies give the directors of proxim the limited right to vote or deliver a 6 schedule 13d page 6 of 8 consent with respect to each of the shares of netopia common stock beneficially owned by the stockholders, at every annual, special, adjourned or postponed meeting of the stockholders of netopia and in every written consent in lieu of such a meeting: (a) in favor of the approval of the merger and the adoption and approval of the merger agreement, and in favor of each of the other actions contemplated by the merger agreement and any action required in furtherance thereof; (b) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with, consummation of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (c) against any other action that is intended, or could reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (d) in favor of waiving any notice that may have been or may be required relating to any reorganization of netopia or any subsidiary of netopia, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of netopia or any subsidiary of netopia, or any sale of assets, change of control, or acquisition of netopia or any subsidiary of netopia by any other person, or any consolidation or merger of netopia or any subsidiary of netopia with or into any other person. the stockholders may vote their shares of netopia common stock on all other matters submitted to the stockholders of netopia for their approval. the voting agreements terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) such date and time as the merger agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to its terms, and (b) such date and time as the merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement. the purpose of the stock option agreement and the voting agreements is to enable proxim and netopia to consummate the transactions contemplated under the merger agreement.

(g) upon consummation of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of netopia will be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of merger sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (except that the name of netopia will remain netopia, inc.), and such certificate of incorporation of netopia, as so amended and restated, will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the general corporation law of the state of delaware and such certificate of incorporation. upon consummation of the merger, the bylaws of merger sub, as in effect immediately prior to the merger, will be, at the effective time of the merger, the bylaws of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the general corporation law of the state of delaware, the certificate of incorporation of netopia and such bylaws. (h)-(i) upon consummation of the merger, the netopia common stock will be deregistered under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and delisted from the nasdaq national market.

(a) parent put. at the request of and upon notice by parent (the "put notice"), at any time during the period during which the option is exercisable pursuant to section 2 (the "purchase period"), the company (or any successor entity thereof) will purchase from parent the option, to the extent not previously exercised, at the price set forth in subparagraph (i) below (as limited by subparagraph (iii) below), and the option shares, if any, acquired by parent pursuant thereto, at the price set forth in subparagraph (ii) below (as limited by subparagraph (iii) below): (i) the difference between the "market/tender offer price" for the company shares as of the date parent gives notice of its intent to exercise its rights under this section 7(a) (defined as the higher of (a) the highest price per share offered as of such date pursuant to any acquisition proposal which -3- 4 was made prior to such date and (b) the highest closing sale price of company shares then on the nasdaq national market during the 20 trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding such date) and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of company shares purchasable pursuant to the option that remain, but only if the market/tender offer price is greater than the exercise price. for purposes of determining the highest price offered pursuant to any acquisition proposal which involves consideration other than cash, the value of such consideration will be equal to the higher of (x) if securities of the same class of the proponent as such consideration are traded on any national securities exchange or by any registered securities association, a value based on the closing sale price or asked price for such securities on their principal trading market on such date and (y) the value ascribed to such consideration by the proponent of such acquisition proposal, or if no such value is ascribed, a value determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company. (ii) the exercise price paid by parent for company shares acquired pursuant to the option plus the difference between the market/tender offer price and such exercise price (but only if the market/tender offer price is greater than the exercise price) multiplied by the number of company shares so purchased. (iii) notwithstanding subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, pursuant to this section 7 company will not be required to pay parent in excess of an aggregate of (x) the product of 1.167 and the termination fee plus (y) the exercise price paid by parent for company shares acquired pursuant to the option minus (z) any amounts paid to parent by the company pursuant to section 7.3(b) of the reorganization agreement and the net cash amounts or the fair market value of any property received by parent pursuant to the sale of option shares (the "profit cap"). if the total amount that otherwise would be received by parent would exceed the profit cap, parent, at its election, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares of company common stock subject to the option, (ii) deliver to company for cancellation shares of company common stock previously purchased by parent, (iii) pay cash to company, (iv) reduce the amount paid pursuant to section 7(a)(i) or 7(a)(ii) or (v) any combination of the foregoing so parent's actually realized total profit, when aggregated with the termination fee actually paid to parent, shall not exceed the profit cap after taking into account the foregoing actions. (b) payment and redelivery of option or shares. in the event parent exercises its rights under section 7(a), the company will, within five business days after parent delivers notice pursuant to section 7(a), pay the required amount to parent in immediately available funds and parent will surrender to the company the option and the certificates evidencing the company shares purchased by parent pursuant thereto. (c) limitation on parent put. company shall use its best efforts to ensure that it can fully perform all of its obligations under this section 7 under applicable law. if company is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the option shares contemplated by this section 7 in full, company will promptly so notify parent, repurchase the maximum possible number of option shares allowed under applicable law and as soon as practicable thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to parent the portion of the payment owed to parent that it is no longer prohibited from delivering. 8. registration rights. (a) following the termination of the reorganization agreement, if parent desires to sell any of the option shares after the purchase of such option shares pursuant hereto, and any such sale requires, in the good faith judgment of parent after consultation with its counsel, registration of such option shares under the securities act, parent (sometimes referred to herein as the "holder") may by written notice (a "registration notice") to the company (the "registrant") request the registrant to register under the securities act all or any part of the shares acquired by the holder pursuant to this agreement (such shares requested to be registered, the "registrable securities") in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any or all shares of the registrable securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to holder upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition stated by holder, including a "shelf" registration statement under rule 415 under the securities act or -4- 5 any successor provision. holder agrees to cause, and to cause any underwriters of any sale or other disposition to cause, any sale or other disposition pursuant to such registration statement to be effected on a widely distributed basis so that upon consummation thereof no purchaser or transferee will own beneficially more than 5.0% of the then-outstanding voting power of registrant. (b) the registrant will use all reasonable efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the registration under the securities act of the unpurchased registrable securities requested to be registered in the registration notice and to keep such registration statement effective for such period not in excess of 120 calendar days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sale or other disposition; provided, however, that the holder will not be entitled to more than an aggregate of two effective registration statements hereunder. the obligations of registrant hereunder to file a registration statement and to maintain its effectiveness may be suspended for up to 120 calendar days in the aggregate if the board of directors of registrant shall have determined that the filing of such registration statement or the maintenance of its effectiveness would require premature disclosure of material nonpublic information that would materially and adversely affect registrant or otherwise interfere with or adversely affect any pending or proposed offering of securities of registrant or any other material transaction involving registrant. if consummation of the sale of any registrable securities pursuant to a registration hereunder does not occur within 120 days after the filing with the sec of the initial registration statement therefor, the provisions of this section 8 will again be applicable to any proposed registration. the registrant will use all reasonable efforts to cause any registrable securities registered pursuant to this section 8 to be qualified for sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the holder may reasonably request and will continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the registrant will not be required to qualify to do business in, or consent to general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision. if registrant effects a registration under the securities act of company common stock for its own account or for any other stockholders of registrant (other than on form s-4 or form s-8, or any successor form), it will allow holder the right to participate in such registration by selling its registrable securities, and such participation will not affect the obligation of registrant to effect demand registration statements for holder under this section 8; provided that, if the managing underwriters of such offering advise registrant in writing that in their opinion the number of shares of company common stock requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering, registrant will include the shares requested to be included therein by holder pro rata with the shares intended to be included therein by registrant and such other stockholders. (c) the registration rights set forth in this section 8 are subject to the condition that the holder will provide the registrant with such information with respect to the holder's registrable securities, the plan for distribution thereof, and such other information with respect to the holder as, in the reasonable judgment of counsel for the registrant, is necessary to enable the registrant to include in a registration statement all facts required to be disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder. (d) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that parent requests a registration of registrable securities pursuant to section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof, the company shall have the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of the registrable securities requested to be registered, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this section 8(d). if the company wishes to exercise such purchase right, then within two (2) business days following receipt of a request for a registration pursuant to section 8(a) or 8(b), the company shall send a written notice (a "repurchase notice") to parent specifying that the company wishes to exercise such purchase right, a date for the closing of such purchase, which shall not be more than five (5) business days after delivery of such repurchase notice, and a place for the closing of such purchase (a "repurchase closing"). upon delivery of a repurchase notice subject to applicable delaware law, a binding agreement shall be deemed to exist between parent and company providing for the purchase by company of the registrable securities requested to be registered by parent, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this section 8(d). the purchase price per share or other unit of registrable securities (the "repurchase price") shall equal the average per share or per unit closing price as quoted on the nasdaq (or if not then quoted thereon, on such other exchange or quotation -5- 6 system on which the registrable securities are quoted) for the period of five (5) trading days ending immediately prior to the day on which parent requests registration of the registrable securities which company subsequently elects to purchase. parent's obligation to deliver any registrable securities at a repurchase closing shall be subject to the condition that, at such repurchase closing, company shall have delivered to parent a certificate signed on behalf of company by company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, which certificate shall be satisfactory in form and substance to parent, to the effect that the purchase by company of such registrable securities (i) permitted under applicable delaware corporate law and under the fraudulent conveyance provisions of the federal bankruptcy code and (ii) does not violate any material agreement to which company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their properties or assets is bound. at any repurchase closing, company shall pay to parent the aggregate repurchase price for the registrable securities being purchased by wire transfer of immediately available funds in an amount equal to such aggregate repurchase price, and parent will surrender to company a certificate evidencing such registrable securities. a purchase of registrable securities by company pursuant to this section 8(d) shall be considered a registration for purposes of section 8(a) and 8(b) hereof. (e) a registration effected under this section 8 will be effected at the registrant's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and the fees and expenses of counsel to the holder, and the registrant will provide to the underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and "comfort" letters from auditors) as are customary in connection with underwritten public offerings and as such underwriters may reasonably require. in connection with any registration, the holder and the registrant agree to enter into an underwriting agreement reasonably acceptable to each such party, in form and substance customary for transactions of this type with the underwriters participating in such offering. (f) the obligations of the company pursuant to subsections 8(a) and 8(b) above shall terminate at such time as parent may sell all shares of company common stock acquired pursuant to the option without restriction pursuant to rule 144(k) under the securities act. (g) indemnification. (i) the registrant will indemnify the holder, each of its directors and officers and each person who controls the holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and each underwriter of the registrant's securities, with respect to any registration, qualification or compliance which has been effected pursuant to this agreement, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by the registrant of any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act applicable to the registrant in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and the registrant will reimburse the holder, each of its directors and officers and each person who controls the holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and each underwriter for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided, that the registrant will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the registrant by such holder or director or officer or controlling person or underwriter seeking indemnification. (ii) the holder will indemnify the registrant, each of its directors and officers and each underwriter of the registrant's securities covered by such registration statement and each person who controls the registrant within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing -6- 7 incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by the holder of any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act applicable to the holder in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and will reimburse the registrant, such directors, officers or control persons or underwriters for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the registrant by the holder for use therein; provided, that in no event will any indemnity under this section 8(g) exceed the net proceeds of the offering received by the holder. (iii) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 8(g) (the "indemnified party") will give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and will permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided, that counsel for the indemnifying party, who will conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, will be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval will not unreasonably be withheld), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense; provided, however, that the indemnifying party will pay such expense if representation of the indemnified party by counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding, and provided further, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 8(g) unless the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an indemnifying party's ability to defend such action. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation will, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. no indemnifying party will be required to indemnify any indemnified party with respect to any settlement entered into without such indemnifying party's prior consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld). 9. adjustment upon changes in capitalization; other agreements. (a) in the event of any change in the company shares by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, mergers (other than the merger), recapitalizations, combinations, exchanges of shares and the like, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the option, the exercise price will be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision will be made in the agreements governing such transaction so that parent will receive, upon exercise of the option, the number and class of shares or other securities or property that parent would have received in respect of the company shares if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, as applicable. (b) without limiting the parties' relative rights and obligations under the reorganization agreement, if the number of outstanding company shares increases or decreases after the date of this agreement (other than pursuant to an event described in section 9(a)), the number of company shares subject to the option (including those option shares which may have already been exercised) will be adjusted so that it equals 19.99% of the number of company shares then issued and outstanding, without giving effect to any option shares. (c) in the event that, at the time of exercise of the option, the company does not have a sufficient number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance, the company shall authorize, and -7- 8 issue to parent a number of shares of the company's preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, with such rights, preferences and privileges, including economic and voting rights, equivalent to 19.99% of the number of company shares then issued and outstanding, without giving effect to the issuance of shares of preferred stock upon exercise of the option. the company further agrees to file a certificate of designation for such shares of preferred stock and to take such actions as are necessary to authorize and reserve shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion or exchange of the preferred stock. in addition, the company agrees that it will not enter into definitive documentation regarding an acquisition transaction, as defined in the reorganization agreement, unless the preferred stock issued hereunder shall be treated in the same manner, including receipt of economic value, as the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of preferred stock would be convertible. for the purposes of this agreement, shares of preferred stock issued upon exercise of the option have all rights, preferences and privileges provided to the option shares, including but not limited to those set forth in sections 7 and 8 of this agreement. 10. restrictive legends. each certificate representing option shares issued to parent hereunder will include a legend in substantially the following form: the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and may be reoffered or sold only if so registered or if an exemption from such registration is available. such securities are also subject to additional restrictions on transfer as set forth in the stock option agreement dated as of january 23, 2001, a copy of which may be obtained from the issuer. it is understood and agreed that (i) the reference to restrictions arising under the securities act in the above legend will be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if such option shares have been registered pursuant to the securities act, such option shares have been sold in reliance on and in accordance with rule 144 under the securities act or holder has delivered to registrant a copy of a letter from the staff of the sec, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to registrant and its counsel, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act and (ii) the reference to restrictions pursuant to this agreement in the above legend will be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the option shares evidenced by certificate(s) containing such reference have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference. 11. transfers. the option shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of except (i) in an underwritten offering as provided in section 8, or (ii) to any purchaser or transferee who would not, to the knowledge of parent after reasonable inquiry (which shall include obtaining representation from the purchaser or transferee), immediately following such sale, assignment, transfer, or disposal, beneficially own more than five percent (5%) of the then outstanding voting power of the company; provided, that parent shall be able to sell any option shares if such sale is made pursuant to a tender or exchange offer. 12. investment intent. parent shall acquire the option shares for investment purposes only and not with a view to any distribution thereof in violation of the securities act, and shall not sell any option shares purchase pursuant to this agreement except in compliance with the securities act and applicable state securities and "blue sky" laws. 13. listing and hsr filing. the company, upon the request of parent, will promptly file an application to list the company shares to be acquired upon exercise of the option for quotation on the nasdaq national market and will use its best efforts to obtain approval of such listing as soon as practicable. promptly after the date hereof, each of the parties hereto will promptly file with the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice all required premerger notification and report forms and other documents and exhibits required to be filed under the hsr act to permit the acquisition of the
