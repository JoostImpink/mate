(ii) dilutive securities. "dilutive securities" means any common stock, preferred stock or other voting capital stock or security (including, without limitation, any common stock, voting preferred stock or other voting capital stock or security issued upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any other securities) of the company, whether now authorized or not; provided, however, that the term "dilutive securities" shall not include: (a) the purchased shares issued under this agreement; (b) any securities issued in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or similar event in which all participation rights holders are entitled to participate on a pro rata basis; (c) any securities for which the issuance gave rise to a right of participation (regardless of whether any such right was exercised) or to a corporate event; 29 (d) any securities issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any securities described in clause (c) above; (e) shares of common stock issued as awards, including pursuant to exercise of options granted, to employees, officers and directors under any plans approved by the board; or (f) shares of common stock issued upon conversion of debentures or upon exercise of warrants. (iii) purchase price. for purposes of this section 7(f), the per share "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the lower of (1) the sales price of the dilutive securities and (2) the average market price (as defined below) of such maintenance securities over the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date on which the participation rights holder elects to purchase such maintenance securities. if the issuance of any dilutive securities occurs upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of other securities ("exchangeable securities"), then the per share price at which such dilutive securities shall be deemed to have been issued shall be the sum of (x) the per share amount paid upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, plus (y) the per share amount previously paid for the exchangeable securities (adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends or other similar events). for purposes of this section 7(f)(iii), "market price" means, as to any maintenance security on a given day, the average of the closing prices of such security's sales on the principal domestic securities exchanges on which such security may at the time be listed, or, if there have been no sales on any such exchange on such day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on all such exchanges at the end of such day, or, if on any day such security is not so listed, the average of the representative bid and asked prices quoted on nasdaq as of 4:00 p.m., new york time, on such day, or, if on any day such security is not quoted on nasdaq, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on such day in the domestic over-the-counter market as reported by the national quotation bureau, incorporated, or any similar successor organization. if at any time a maintenance security are not listed on any domestic securities exchange or quoted on nasdaq or the domestic over-the-counter market ("unlisted securities"), the "market price" shall be the fair value thereof determined jointly by the company and the holder. (iv) alternative purchase price. if a participation rights holder does not elect to purchase its maintenance amount (as defined below) at the time of issuance of any dilutive securities specified in a maintenance notice (as defined below), and in the written opinion of the company's independent auditors, made available to each participation rights holder upon request, the effect of determining the purchase price after such issuance pursuant to paragraph (iii) above would require the company to take a charge against earnings in accordance with gaap, then for purposes of this section 7(f), "purchase price" shall mean the market price on the date the participation rights holder elects to purchase its maintenance amount. (v) consideration other than cash. if dilutive securities or exchangeable securities were issued for consideration other than cash, the per share amounts paid for such dilutive securities or exchangeable securities shall be determined jointly in good faith by the company and the participation rights holder. 30 (vi) appraiser. if the company and the participation rights holder are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time with respect to (a) the market price of unlisted securities or (b) the per share amounts paid for dilutive securities or exchangeable securities issued for consideration other than cash, such market price or per share amounts paid, as the case may be, shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the company and the participation rights holder. the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding on the company and the participation rights holder. the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be paid by the company. (vii) prior percentage interest. a participation rights holder's "prior percentage interest" for purposes of the right of maintenance is the ratio of (a) the participant share number for such participation rights holder as of the date of such maintenance notice (the "notice date"), to (b) the difference between (1) the sum of (x) the total number of shares of common stock and other voting capital stock and securities of the company outstanding on the notice date, plus (y) the number of shares of voting capital stock or securities issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any other security of the company outstanding as of such date (assuming, for purposes of the immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y), the common stock or other securities described in such maintenance notice are deemed not issued), and (2) the total number of dilutive securities issued since the later of the closing date and the last notice date (but excluding any maintenance securities issued pursuant to the last maintenance notice). (viii) maintenance amount. a participation rights holder's "maintenance amount" with respect to any maintenance notice shall equal such number of maintenance securities as shall (upon purchase thereof in full by the participation rights holder) enable such participation rights holder to maintain its prior percentage interest on a fully-diluted basis. as an example, assume that the company had 10,000 shares outstanding and the participation rights holder holds 20% of such shares (or 2,000 shares). the company first issues 400 shares to a third party ("issuance 1"), an amount insufficient to trigger a notice of issuance pursuant to section 7(f)(ix). the company then proposes to issue 4,600 shares to a third party ("issuance 2"), an amount that triggers a maintenance notice. the participation rights holder shall have the right to maintain its 20% interest after considering issuances 1 and 2 and the new shares issued to the participation rights holder. in this example, the participation rights holder shall have the right to purchase an additional 1,250 shares, thereby resulting in the participation rights holder holding 20% of the securities outstanding (3,250 shares out of 16,250 shares). (ix) maintenance notice. within ten (10) business days after each anniversary of the closing date, and at least ten (10) business days before each issuance of dilutive securities that when cumulated with all prior issuances of dilutive securities since the later of (i) the closing date and (ii) the date of the last notice date (which, as a result of which, the participation rights holder had an opportunity to purchase maintenance securities), would result in a five percent (5%) or greater reduction in a participation rights holders' prior percentage interest, the company shall give to each participation rights holder written notice (the "maintenance notice") describing the number of dilutive securities issued since such prior notice date and the price and non-price terms upon which the company issued such dilutive 31 securities, and the maintenance amount that such participation rights holder is entitled to purchase as a result of such issuances. (x) purchase of maintenance securities. if a participation rights holder exercises its right to purchase dilutive securities, such participation rights holder shall have sixty (60) days after the issuance of the dilutive securities specified in the applicable maintenance notice to purchase its maintenance amount at the purchase price (as determined in accordance with this section 7(f)) and upon the other terms and conditions specified in the maintenance notice. the closing of such purchase shall occur within ten (10) days after such election to purchase. if any participation rights holder fails to elect to purchase such participation rights holder's full maintenance amount of maintenance securities within such 60-day period, then such participation rights holder shall forfeit the right hereunder to purchase that part of its maintenance amount that it did not so elect to purchase. (xi) termination. the company's obligations under this section 7(f) shall terminate upon the earlier of (a) the expiration of the initial rights period and (b) the date which is the fifth (5th) anniversary of the closing date. (g) rights relating to a corporate event. (1) corporate events. a "corporate event" shall mean any of the following, whether accomplished through one or a series of related transactions: (a) any transaction, other than an issuance of securities in connection with the acquisition of an unaffiliated third party in an arms length transaction, that results in a greater than thirty percent (30%) change in the total outstanding number of voting securities (which, for purposes of this agreement, shall mean all securities of the company that presently are, or would be upon conversion, exchange or exercise, entitled to vote in the election of directors) of the company immediately prior to such issuance (other than any such change solely as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or other recapitalization affecting holders of common stock and other classes of voting securities of the company on a pro rata basis); (b) an acquisition of the company or any of its "significant subsidiaries" (as defined in the sec's rule 1-02(w) of regulation s-x) ("significant subsidiaries") by consolidation, merger (regardless of whether the company is the survivor of such merger or not), share purchase or exchange or other reorganization or transaction in which the holders of the company's or such significant subsidiary's outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such transaction own, immediately after such transaction, securities representing less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the company, any such significant subsidiary or the person issuing such securities or surviving such transaction, as the case may be; (c) the acquisition of all or substantially all the assets of the company or any significant subsidiary; (d) the grant by the company or any of its significant subsidiaries of an exclusive license for any material portion of the company's or such significant subsidiary's intellectual property to a person other than the investor or any of its subsidiaries; and (e) any transaction or series of related transactions that results in the failure of the majority of the members of the board immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or series of related transactions failing to constitute a majority of the board (or its successor) immediately following such transaction or series of related transactions. 32 (2) notice of corporate events. until expiration of the notification period (as defined below), the company shall provide the investor with detailed written notice of terms of any offer (written or oral) from any person or entity for a proposed corporate event. any notice shall be delivered to the investor as soon as practicable but no later than two (2) business days after the date the company first becomes aware of such offer or proposed corporate event. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such notice shall set forth the identity(ies) of the person(s) or entity(ies) involved, the consideration to be paid and all other material terms and conditions. if such offer is in writing (whether in the form of a letter of intent, term sheet or otherwise), the company shall deliver a copy thereof to the investor. (3) right of first refusal. during the period commencing on the closing date and ending on the date which is six (6) months thereafter (the "rofr period"), the company shall, prior to effecting or entering into any agreement for any corporate event, present to the investor in writing the final terms and conditions of the proposed corporate event, including the name of the other party or parties to the corporate event and a copy of the definitive agreements that the company is prepared to enter into (such information and agreements, a "final notice"). the investor shall have ten (10) business days after the date of receipt of the final notice to deliver written notice to the company agreeing to enter into a written agreement with the company on substantially the same terms and conditions specified in the final notice, which agreement shall nevertheless provide for consummation of the transaction within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of delivery of the final notice (such 120 day period subject to extensions for regulatory compliance). during such (10) business day period, the investor shall be entitled to conduct due diligence with the reasonable cooperation of the company. if the investor fails to enter into a definitive agreement within such 10 business day period, for a period of ninety (90) days thereafter, the company shall have the right to enter into an agreement regarding such corporate event with the party or parties specified in the applicable final notice; provided, however, that such definitive agreement is entered into within ninety (90) days following termination of such ten (10) business day period; provided further, that if during such ten (10) business day period, the investor shall have made a written offer for the acquisition of the company, the corporate event with such a third party shall be for at least ninety-five (95%) of the price offered by the investor and on other terms no less favorable to shareholders of the company than the terms of the offer proposed by the investor with respect to shareholders other than the investor. (4) right of resale. if the investor shall fail to exercise its right of first refusal as to a corporate event pursuant to section 7(g)(3), the investor shall, upon the company's entering into an agreement to consummate a corporate event, have the right to sell to the company any or all shares of purchased shares and all new securities and maintenance securities then owned by the investor. such sale shall be made on the following terms and conditions: (a) the price per share at which such shares are to be sold to company shall be equal to the greater of: (1) the per share purchase price and (2) either the highest price per share of capital stock (or equivalent) paid in connection with the corporate event or, if the transaction involves the sale of a significant subsidiary or assets or the licensing of intellectual property, the investor's pro rata share of the consideration received, directly or 33 indirectly, by the company in such transaction based on its then fully-diluted ownership of the company's capital stock. (b) the company shall reimburse the investor for any and all fees and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with this section 7(g)(4). (c) within fifteen (15) days prior to the consummation of the corporate event, the investor shall deliver to the company the certificate or certificates representing shares to be sold, each certificate to be properly endorsed for transfer. (d) the company shall, concurrent with the closing of the corporate event, pay the aggregate purchase price therefor and the amount of reimbursable fees and expenses as specified in section 7(g)(4)(b) in cash. (5) right of notification and first negotiation. for a period (x) commencing upon expiration of the rofr period and (y) ending on the day that is nine hundred (900) days after such last day (the "notification period"), the company shall, prior to the board's approving or disapproving a corporate event or the company's or any of its subsidiaries' entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a corporate event, notify the investor of all terms and conditions of such corporate event and then attempt to negotiate in good faith with the investor for a period of not less than ten (10) business days for the investor to acquire the company (or a significant subsidiary, assets or license, as the case may be) or enter into another corporate event with the company. during such ten (10) business day period, the investor shall be entitled to conduct due diligence with the reasonable cooperation of the company. during such ten (10) business day period, any alternative proposal made by the investor shall be submitted by the company to the board and the board shall, in good faith, either approve or disapprove the investor's alternative proposal. to the extent that the company and the investor do not enter into an agreement with respect to such an acquisition or other corporate event with the investor during such ten (10) business day period, the board shall be free to approve or disapprove such corporate event and the company shall be free to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a corporate event with a third party and subsequently consummate such corporate event. (6) notice of ten percent acquisitions. until expiration of the initial rights period, the company shall provide the investor with detailed written notice of the earlier of the following events: (x) the company's first becoming aware of any person or entity acquiring after the date hereof any outstanding voting securities of the company such that following such acquisition such person or entity owns ten percent (10%) or more of the company's outstanding voting securities, or (y) the terms of any offer or proposal (written or oral) after the date hereof from any person or entity such that following the consummation of any such offer or proposal such person or entity would own ten percent (10%) or more of the company's outstanding voting securities. any notice shall be delivered to the investor within three (3) business days after the date the company first becomes aware of such acquisition, offer or proposal. such notice shall set forth, to the extent known by company, the identity(ies) of the person(s) or entity(ies) involved, the consideration paid or to be paid and all other material terms 34 and conditions. if such offer or proposal is in writing (whether in the form of a letter of intent, term sheet or otherwise), the company shall deliver a copy thereof to the investor. 8. indemnification. (a) agreement to indemnify. (i) company indemnity. the investor, its affiliates and associates, and each officer, director, shareholder, employer, representative and agent of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "investor indemnitees") shall each be indemnified and held harmless to the extent set forth in this section 8 by the company with respect to any and all damages (as defined below) incurred by any investor indemnitee as a proximate result of any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach of, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the company in this agreement (including any exhibits and schedules hereto). indemnification claims arising from the registration of purchased shares under federal and state securities laws are covered by section 7(c) and not this section 8. (ii) investor indemnity. the company, its respective affiliates and associates, and each officer, director, shareholder, employer, representative and agent of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "company indemnitees") shall each be indemnified and held harmless to the extent set forth in this section 8, by the investor, in respect of any and all damages incurred by any company indemnitee as a proximate result of any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach of, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the investor in this agreement. indemnification claims arising from the registration of purchased shares under federal and state securities laws are covered by section 7(c) and not this section 8. (iii) equitable relief. nothing set forth in this section 8 shall be deemed to prohibit or limit any investor indemnitee's or company indemnitee's right at any time before, on or after the closing, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the failure of any indemnifying party to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement contained herein. (b) survival. all representations and warranties of the investor and the company contained herein and all claims of any investor indemnitee or company indemnitee in respect of any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach hereof, shall survive the closing until the second anniversary of the date of this agreement, regardless of whether the applicable statute of limitations, including extensions thereof, may expire. all covenants and agreements of the investor and the company contained in this agreement shall survive the closing in perpetuity (except to the extent any such covenant or agreement shall expire by its terms). all claims of any investor indemnitee or company indemnitee in respect of any breach of such covenants or agreements shall survive the closing until the expiration of one year following the non-breaching party's obtaining actual knowledge of such breach. (c) claims for indemnification. if any investor indemnitee or company indemnitee (an "indemnitee") shall believe that such indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this section 8 in respect of any damages, such indemnitee shall give the appropriate indemnifying party (which for purposes hereof, in the case of an investor indemnitee, means the 35 company, and in the case of a company indemnitee, means the investor) prompt written notice thereof. any such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail and to the extent then known the basis for such claim for indemnification. the failure of such indemnitee to give notice of any claim for indemnification promptly shall not adversely affect such indemnitee's right to indemnity hereunder except to the extent that such failure adversely affects the right of the indemnifying party to assert any reasonable defense to such claim. each such claim for indemnity shall expressly state that the indemnifying party shall have only the twenty (20) business day period referred to in the next sentence to dispute or deny such claim. the indemnifying party shall have twenty (20) business days following its receipt of such notice either (i) to acquiesce in such claim by giving such indemnitee written notice of such acquiescence or (ii) to object to the claim by giving such indemnitee written notice of the objection. if the indemnifying party does not object thereto within such twenty (20) business day period, such indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified for all damages reasonably and proximately incurred by such indemnitee in respect of such claim. if the indemnifying party objects to such claim in a timely manner, the senior management of the company and the investor shall meet to attempt to resolve such dispute. if the dispute cannot be resolved by the senior management, either party may make a written demand for formal dispute resolution and specify therein the scope of the dispute. within thirty (30) days after such written notification, the parties agree to meet for one (1) day with an impartial mediator and consider dispute resolution alternatives other than litigation. if an alternative method of dispute resolution is not agreed upon within thirty days after the one day mediation, either party may begin litigation proceedings. nothing in this section shall be deemed to require arbitration. (d) defense of claims. in connection with any claim that may give rise to indemnity under this section 8 resulting from or arising out of any claim or proceeding against an indemnitee by a person or entity that is not a party hereto, the indemnifying party may (unless such indemnitee elects not to seek indemnity hereunder for such claim) but shall not be obligated to, upon written notice to the relevant indemnitee, assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding if the indemnifying party with respect to such claim or proceeding acknowledges to the indemnitee the indemnitee's right to indemnity pursuant hereto to the extent provided herein (as such claim may have been modified through written agreement of the parties) and provides assurances, reasonably satisfactory to such indemnitee, that the indemnifying party will be financially able to satisfy such claim to the extent provided herein if such claim or proceeding is decided adversely; provided, however, that nothing set forth herein shall be deemed to require the indemnifying party to waive any crossclaims or counterclaims the indemnifying party may have against the indemnified party for damages. the indemnified party shall be entitled to retain separate counsel, reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party, if the indemnified party shall determine, upon the written advice of counsel, that an actual or potential conflict of interest exists between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with such proceeding. the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel to the extent the indemnified party is entitled to indemnification by the indemnifying party with respect to such claim or proceeding under this section 8(d). if the indemnifying party assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the indemnifying party shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to such indemnitee to conduct the defense of such claim or proceeding, shall take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof and shall at all times diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof. if the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of any claim or proceeding in accordance 36 with this section 8(d), the indemnifying party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or proceeding, with the prior written consent of such indemnitee, not to be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness thereof; provided further, that the indemnifying party shall not be authorized to encumber any of the assets of any indemnitee or to agree to any restriction that would apply to any indemnitee or to its conduct of business; and provided further, that a condition to any such settlement shall be a complete release of such indemnitee and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents with respect to such claim, including any reasonably foreseeable collateral consequences thereof. such indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action, with its own counsel and at its own expense. each indemnitee shall, and shall cause each of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents to, cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in the defense of any claim or proceeding being defended by the indemnifying party pursuant to this section 8(d). if the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of any claim or proceeding resulting therefrom in accordance with the terms of this section 8(d), such indemnitee may defend against such claim or proceeding in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling such claim or proceeding after giving notice of the same to the indemnifying party, on such terms as such indemnitee may deem appropriate. if any indemnifying party seeks to question the manner in which such indemnitee defended such claim or proceeding or the amount of or nature of any such settlement, such indemnifying party shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that such indemnitee did not defend such claim or proceeding in a reasonably prudent manner. (e) certain definitions. as used in this section 8, (a) "affiliate" means, with respect to any person or entity, any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such other person or entity; (b) "associate" means, when used to indicate a relationship with any person or entity, (1) any other person or entity of which such first person or entity is an officer, director or partner or is, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner of ten percent (10%) or more of any class of equity securities, membership interests or other comparable ownership interests issued by such other person or entity, (2) any trust or other estate in which such first person or entity has a ten percent (10%) or more beneficial interest or as to which such first person or entity serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity, and (3) any relative or spouse of such first person or entity who has the same home as such first person or entity or who is a director or officer of such first person or entity; (c) "damages" means all demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities, judgments, awards, fines, response costs, sanctions, taxes, penalties, charges and amounts paid in settlement, including (1) interest on cash disbursements in respect of any of the foregoing at the prime rate of chase manhattan bank, as in effect from time to time, compounded quarterly, from the date each such cash disbursement is made until the date the party incurring such cash disbursement shall have been indemnified in respect thereof, and (2) reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable costs, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other agents of, or other parties retained by, such party), and (d) "proceeding" means any action, suit, hearing, arbitration, audit, proceeding (public or private) or investigation that is brought or initiated by or against any federal, state, local or foreign governmental authority or any other person or entity. 37 9. assignment. the rights of the investor under sections 7(b), (c), (e) and (f) are transferable only to a person or entity who acquires at least twenty percent (20%) of the purchased shares issued on the closing date (subject to appropriate adjustment for all stock splits, dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like where all holders of common stock participate on a pro rata basis); provided, however, that no person or entity may be assigned any of the foregoing rights unless the company is given written notice by the assigning party at the time of such assignment stating the name and address of the assignee and identifying the securities of the company as to which the rights in question are being assigned; and provided further, that any such assignee shall receive such assigned rights subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement (including all terms and conditions governing the duration and termination of rights of the investor). the rights of the investor under section 7(g) may be assigned only to one of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that no such assignment of such rights under section 7(g) shall be effective until the company is given written notice by the investor stating the name and address of the assignee; and provided further, that any such assignee shall receive such assigned rights subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement. 10. miscellaneous.
