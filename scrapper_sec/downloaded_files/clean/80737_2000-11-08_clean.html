maryland corporation (as successor to security capital realty investors incorporated) ("security capital"), on march 2, 1990, and amended on march 5, 1990, march 8, 1990, march 15, 1990, march 19,

april 21, 2000, and july 24, 2000. item 1. security and issuer. this amendment relates to common shares of beneficial interest, $1.00 par value per share (the "common shares"), of archstone communities trust, a maryland real estate investment trust (the "company"), the principal executive offices of which are at 7670 south chester street, englewood, colorado 80112. the company was formerly known as security capital pacific trust. item 4. purpose of transaction. except as described below, there are no other changes to report from the responses previously provided in response to this item requirement. on november 8, 2000, security capital caused the company to file a registration statement on form s-3 to register with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") all 35,471,214 common shares of the company owned by security capital. the registration statement must be declared effective by the sec before security capital can sell any common shares under the registration statement. security capital requested the filing of the registration statement in accordance with its registration rights under the third amended and restated investor agreement, by and between the company and security capital, dated as of september 9, 1997, and amended by amendment no. 1 thereto dated as of july 7, 1998, and further amended by amendment no. 2 thereto dated as of july 19, 2000 (the "third amended and restated investor agreement, as amended"). security capital requested the filing of the registration statement to provide for maximum flexibility as security capital works toward achieving its long-term stated objectives. this filing will permit security capital to consider inquiries from persons interested in buying freely tradable common shares. security capital's objective in any sales will be to maximize its return on its holdings of common shares. security capital currently owns 35,471,214 common shares, or 28.96% of the outstanding common shares. once the registration statement is declared effective, security capital may from time to time offer and sell any or all the common shares covered by the registration statement. the registration of the common shares does not necessarily mean that security capital will sell all or any of the common shares. if security capital sells all of the common shares covered by the registration statement, it will no longer own any of the common shares. security capital may sell common shares under the registration statement directly or through broker-dealers or underwriters who may act solely as agents, or who may acquire shares as principals. common shares may be sold from time to time by security capital or by its permitted pledgees, transferees or other successors in interest to security capital. the distribution of the common shares may be effected in one or more transactions that may take place through the new york stock exchange, including block trades or ordinary broker's transactions, or through broker-dealers acting either as principal or agent, or through privately negotiated transactions, or through an underwritten public offering, or through a combination of any such methods of sale, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. usual and customary or specifically negotiated brokerage fees or commissions may be paid by security capital in connection with such sales. additionally, security capital may issue common shares upon conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities issued by security capital. security capital intends to maintain its position as the principal shareholder of the company and intends to continue to play a major role in the direction of the company for the purpose of maximizing the value of the company so long as security capital continues to own its common shares. security capital has certain rights to board nominees, approval rights and consultation rights under the third amended and restated investor agreement, as amended. these rights are based on its percentage ownership of the outstanding common shares. if security capital owns less than 25% of the outstanding common shares, its approval rights will be eliminated with respect to the issuance of common shares below fair market value, the issuance of certain preferred stock, the adoption of certain equity-based employee benefit plans and approval of executive compensation, and the incurrence of certain debt. if security capital owns between 10% and 25% of the outstanding common shares, it will be entitled to nominate one person to the company's board of trustees and through its board nominees, it will have certain consultation rights. security capital currently has the right to nominate two persons to the company's board of trustees. if security capital owns less than 10% of the outstanding common shares, it will no longer have a right to any nominee on the company's board of trustees, and its consultation rights will be eliminated with respect to the company's annual budgets, incurrence of certain expenses, acquisition or sale of assets with an aggregate purchase price in excess of $50 million, and entering into certain management contracts. except as set forth in this item 4, security capital presently has no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the actions set forth in parts (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. security capital may at any time reconsider and change its plans or proposals relating to the foregoing. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.
