(b) conversion price. each series a preferred share shall be convertible into the number of common shares that results from dividing $1.95 by the conversion price per share (the "conversion price") in effect at the time of conversion of such series a preferred share. the conversion price for each series a preferred share at the original issue date shall be $1.95 and shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided herein. (c) automatic conversion. each series a preferred share which remains outstanding on the closing date for a public offering (the "registration date") shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the company, except as provided in clause (i) below, be converted on the same basis and at the same conversion price as if each holder thereof had properly exercised his right to convert on the date next preceding the registration date; provided, that (i) each holder of series a preferred shares shall have received written notice of the proposed public offering at least 30 days prior to the date the registration statement relating to that public offering becomes effective, (ii) such conversion shall be effective at the close of business on the registration date, and (iii) the company shall have no obligation to issue and deliver to any such holder of series a preferred shares on such date a certificate for the number of common shares to which such holder shall be entitled until such time as such holder has surrendered his certificate or certificates for his series a preferred shares, duly endorsed, at the office of the company or any transfer agent for the common shares, or the holder notifies the company that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the company to indemnify the company from any - 5 - 56 loss incurred by it in connection therewith. all rights with respect to series a preferred shares outstanding on the registration date shall terminate on such registration date, except only the right of the holders of such shares to receive common shares upon surrender of their certificates for the series a preferred shares and their rights with respect to unpaid dividends described in paragraph 5(d) of this section i. (d) mechanics of conversion; unpaid dividends. before any holder of series a preferred shares shall be entitled to convert the same into common shares, such holder shall either (i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the company or of any transfer agent for the series a preferred shares or common shares, or (ii) deliver an affidavit in favor of the company stating that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and containing an agreement satisfactory to the company to indemnify the company from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith, and shall give written notice by mail, postage prepaid, to the company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the number of series a preferred shares being converted and the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for common shares to which such holder shall be entitled. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the series a preferred shares to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the common shares issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such common shares issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such common shares on such date. all dividends accrued and unpaid prior to surrender of series a preferred shares surrendered for conversion shall at the option of the holders of series a preferred shares, either (i) be subtracted from the aggregate conversion price as in effect at the time of conversion or (ii) constitute a debt of the company payable to the converting shareholder, and no dividend or other distribution shall be paid on, declared or set apart for any common shares until such debt is fully paid or sufficient funds set apart for the payment thereof. (e) adjustment for stock splits and combinations. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the original issue date effect a subdivision or combination of any outstanding common shares, the conversion price then in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be proportionately adjusted by multiplying the then effective conversion price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of common shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of common shares issued and outstanding immediately after such subdivision or combination. the number of common shares outstanding at any time shall, for the purposes of this paragraph 5(e) of this section i, include the number of common shares into which any convertible securities of the company may be converted, or for which any warrant, option or rights of the company may be exchanged. any adjustment under this paragraph 5(e) of this section i shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. - 6 - 57 (f) adjustments for other dividends and distributions. in the event the company at any time or from time to time after the original issue date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of common shares entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in (i) evidences of indebtedness of the company, (ii) assets of the company (other than cash), or (iii) securities of the company other than common shares, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of series a preferred shares shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of common shares receivable thereupon, the amount of such evidences, assets or securities that they would have received had they held, on such record date, the maximum number of common shares into which their series a preferred shares could then have been converted. (g) adjustment for reclassification, exchange or substitution. if the common shares issuable upon the conversion of the series a preferred shares shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this paragraph 5 of this section i), then and in each such event the holder of each series a preferred share shall have the right thereafter to convert each such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change, by holders of the maximum number of common shares into which such series a preferred shares could have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. (h) reorganization, mergers, consolidations or sales of assets or capital stock. if at any time or from time to time there shall be (i) a capital reorganization of the common shares (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this paragraph 5 of this section i) or (ii) a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange of the company with or into another corporation in which consolidation, merger or statutory share exchange persons owning capital stock of the company immediately prior to the consolidation, merger or share exchange own less than a majority of the voting stock of the resulting, surviving or exchanging corporation, or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all the company's properties and assets or capital stock to any other person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger, share exchange, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the series a preferred shares shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the series a preferred shares, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the company, or of the successor corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation, share exchange or sale, to which a holder of the maximum number of common shares into which such series a preferred shares would then be converted would have been entitled on such capital, reorganization, merger, share exchange, consolidation, or sale. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this paragraph 5 of this section i with respect to the rights - 7 - 58 of the holders of the series a preferred shares after the reorganization, merger, share exchange, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this paragraph 5 of this section i (including adjustment of the conversion price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the series a preferred shares) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. (i) sale of shares below conversion price. (i) if, at any time or from time to time after the original issue date, the company shall issue or sell additional common shares (as hereinafter defined), other than as a dividend and other than upon a subdivision or combination of common shares as provided in paragraph 5(e) of this section i, for a consideration per share less than the then existing conversion price for the series a preferred shares (or, if an adjusted conversion price shall be in effect by reason of one or more previous adjustments, then less than such adjusted conversion price), then in each case the then conversion price for the series a preferred shares shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price equal to such consideration per share. (ii) for the purpose of making any adjustment in the conversion price or number of common shares deliverable on conversion of series a preferred shares as provided above, the consideration received by the company for any issue or sale of securities shall, (a) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the net amount of cash receivable by the company after deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions, concessions or compensation paid or allowed by the company in connection with such issue or sale, (b) to the extent it consists of services or property other than cash, be computed at the fair market value of such services or property as reasonably determined in good faith by the board; and (c) if additional common shares, convertible securities (as hereinafter defined), or rights or options to purchase either additional common shares or convertible securities are issued or sold together with other shares or securities or other assets of the company for a consideration that covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the board to be allocable to such additional common shares, convertible securities or rights or options. (iii) for the purpose of the adjustment provided in subsection (i) of this paragraph 5(i) of this section i, if at any time or from time to time after the original issue date the company shall issue any rights or options for the purchase - 8 - 59 of, or stock or other securities convertible into, additional common shares (such convertible stock or securities being hereinafter referred to as "convertible securities"), then, in each case, if the effective price (as hereinafter defined in this subsection (iii) of this paragraph 5(i) of this section i) of such rights, options or convertible securities shall be less than the then existing conversion price for the series a preferred shares, the company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities the maximum number of additional common shares issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the company for the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities, plus, in the case of such options or rights, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the company upon exercise or conversion of such options or rights. for purposes of this subsection (iii) of this paragraph 5(i) of this section i, "effective price" shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total of all such minimum amounts of consideration by such maximum number of additional common shares. no further adjustment of the conversion price adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options, or convertible securities shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of additional common shares on the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such convertible securities. if any such rights or options or the conversion privilege represented by any such convertible securities shall expire without having been exercised, the conversion price adjusted upon the issuance of such rights, options or convertible securities shall be readjusted to the conversion price that would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only additional common shares so issued were the additional common shares, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion of such convertible securities, and such additional common shares, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling the convertible securities actually converted plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the company on the conversion of such convertible securities. (iv) for the purpose of the adjustment provided for in subsection (i) of this paragraph 5(i) of this section i, if at any time or from time to time after the original issue date the company shall issue any rights or options for the purchase of convertible securities, then, in each such case, if the effective price (as hereinafter defined in this subsection (iv) of this paragraph 5(i) of this section i) thereof is less than the then current conversion price, the company shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options the maximum number of additional common shares issuable upon conversion of the total amount of convertible securities covered by such rights or options and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such additional common shares - 9 - 60 an amount equal to the amount of consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion of such convertible securities plus the consideration, if any, received by the company upon the issuance of such convertible securities. for purposes of the foregoing "effective price" for purposes of this subsection (iv) of paragraph 5(i) of this section i shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total amount of such consideration by such maximum number of additional common shares. no further adjustment of such conversion price adjusted upon the issuance of such rights or options shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of the convertible securities upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon the actual issuance of additional common shares upon the conversion of such convertible securities. the provisions of subsection (iii) above for the readjustment of such conversion price upon the expiration of rights or options or the rights of conversion of convertible securities, shall apply mutatis mutandis to the rights, options and convertible securities referred to in this subsection (iv). (j) definition. the term "additional common shares" as used herein shall mean all common shares issued or deemed issued by the company after the original issue date, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the company, other than (i) common shares issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock, (ii) common shares issued upon conversion of the series b preferred stock, (iii) any common shares, convertible securities, options or rights (as adjusted for all stock dividends, stock splits, subdivisions and combinations) issued to employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons performing services for the company or any subsidiary (if so issued solely because of any such person's status as an officer, director, employee, consultant or other person performing services for the company or any subsidiary and not as part of any offering of the company's securities) pursuant to any stock option plan, stock purchase plan or management incentive plan, agreement or arrangement approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors who are not employees of the company or any subsidiary of the company, (iv) as to each holder of series a preferred shares, common shares which are purchased by such holder, (v) up to 300,000 common shares (as adjusted for all stock dividends, stock splits and combinations) issued upon the exercise of stock purchase warrants originally granted in connection with sales or issuances of series a preferred shares or debt or other securities which are convertible into series a preferred shares, (v) any common shares issued upon the exercise of up to 605,314 stock purchase warrants granted in connection with sales or issuances of senior subordinated promissory notes by the company to healthplan services corporation or any assignee or successor of healthplan services corporation, (vi) any common shares (as adjusted for all stock dividends, stock splits, subdivisions and combinations) issued to sellers of businesses acquired by the company as full or partial consideration of such acquisition, or (vii) common shares issued or issuable with respect to the securities referred to in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) by way of stock split or stock dividend or in connection with a combination of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other reorganization. - 10 - 61 (k) accountants' certificate of adjustment. in each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the conversion price for the number of common shares or other securities issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred shares, the company, at its expense, shall cause independent certified public accountants of recognized standing selected by the company (who may be the independent certified public accounts then auditing the books of the company) to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance herewith and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of the series a preferred shares at the holder's address as shown in the company's books. the certificate shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based including a statement of (i) the consideration received or to be received by the company for any additional common shares issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (ii) the conversion price at the time in effect for each series of the series a preferred shares, and (iii) the number of common shares and the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the series a preferred shares.

(m) fractional shares. no fractional common shares shall be issued upon conversion of series a preferred shares. in lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the company shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one common share on the date of conversion, as reasonably determined in good faith by the board. whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of series a preferred shares the holder is at the time converting into common shares and the number of common shares issuable upon such aggregate conversion. - 11 - 62 (n) reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued common shares, solely for the following purposes, (i) such number of common shares required to pay all dividends payable in common shares which the company by agreement is obligated, or may choose, to pay, (ii) such number of common shares as may from time to time be required, at such time, to be issued by the company upon exercise of all then-exercisable warrants and options to purchase common shares or the right to convert other convertible securities into common shares, and (iii) such number of its common shares as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding series a preferred shares. as a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would cause an adjustment to the conversion price, the company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued common shares to such number of shares as shall be sufficient in order that it may be validly and legally issue the common shares issuable based upon such adjusted conversion price. (o) notices. any notice required by the provisions of this paragraph 5 of this section i to be given to the holder of the series a preferred shares shall be deemed given when personally delivered to such holder or five business days after the same has been deposited in the united states mail, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at this address appearing on the books of the company.

(e) "excluded shares" means (i) common shares issued upon conversion of the series a preferred shares, (ii) common shares issued upon conversion of the series b preferred shares, (iii) the common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants granted in connection with the issuance and sale by the company of senior subordinated notes to healthplan services corporation or its successors or assigns, (iv) common shares, options or convertible securities issued to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the company or its subsidiaries in transactions approved or pursuant to a plan approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors of the company who are not employees of the company or any subsidiary of the company, (v) as to each holder of series b preferred shares, common shares which are purchased by such holder, (vi) up to 300,000 common shares (as adjusted for all stock dividends, stock splits and combinations) issued upon the exercise of stock purchase warrants originally granted in connection with sales or issuances of series a preferred shares or debt or other securities which are convertible into series a preferred shares, (vii) common shares, options or convertible securities issued to sellers of businesses acquired by the company as full or partial consideration of such acquisition, or (viii) common shares issued or issuable with respect to the securities referred to in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) by way of stock split or stock dividend or in connection with a combination of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, share exchange or other reorganization. (f) "fair value" of a common share on any specified date means: (i) if common shares are then listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange or traded on any national market system, the average - 13 - 64 of the daily closing prices for the thirty (30) trading days before such date, excluding any trades which are not bona fide, arm's length transactions. the closing price for each day shall be the last sale price on such date or, if no such sale takes place on such date, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such date, in each case as officially reported on the principal national securities exchange or national market system on which such shares are then listed, admitted to trading or traded. (ii) if no common shares are then listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange or traded on any national market system, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices thereof on such date in the over-the-counter market as shown by the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system or, if such shares are not then quoted in such system, as published by the national quotation bureau, incorporated or any similar successor organization, and in either case as reported by any member firm of the new york stock exchange selected by the holders of a majority of the outstanding series b preferred shares. (iii) if no common shares are then listed or admitted to trading on any national exchange or traded on any national market system, and if no closing bid and asked prices thereof are then so quoted or published in the over-the-counter market, the fair value of a common share shall be as mutually agreed by the company and holders of a majority of the outstanding series b preferred shares; provided, however that if the company and such holders are unable to mutually agree upon the fair value, the company and such holders shall, within five days from the date that either party determines that they cannot agree, jointly retain an investment banking firm, or a nationally recognized accounting firm or other firm providing similar valuation services, satisfactory to each of them. if the company and such holders are unable to agree on the selection of such a firm within such five day period, the company and such holders shall, within twenty days after expiration of such five day period, each retain a separate independent investment banking firm (which firm, in either case, shall not be the investment banking firm regularly retained by the company). if either the company or such holders fail to retain such an investment banking firm during such twenty day period, then the independent investment banking firm retained by such holders or the company, as the case may be, shall alone take the actions described below. such firms shall determine within 30 days of being retained the fair value of a common share and deliver their opinion in writing to the company and to such holders as to the fair value. if such firms cannot jointly agree upon the fair value, then, unless otherwise directed in writing by both the company and such holders, such firms, in their sole discretion, shall choose another investment banking firm independent of the company, which firm shall make such determination and render such an opinion as promptly as practicable. in either case, the determination so made shall be conclusive and binding on the company and the holders of the series b preferred shares. the fees and expenses for such determination made by any and all such - 14 - 65 investment banking or other firms shall be paid one-half by the company and one-half by such holders. in the determination of the fair value of a common share, there shall not be taken into consideration any premium for shares representing control of the company.

(a) the holders of record of the then outstanding series b preferred shares shall be entitled to receive when, as and if declared by the board, but in any event not prior to the first anniversary of the original issue date, out of the funds legally available therefor, cumulative dividends at the annual rate of 8% per share. such dividends shall accrue on each series b preferred share from and after the first anniversary of the original issue date, shall accrue from day to day, whether or not earned or declared, and shall be payable in cash. such dividends will in no event be declared or paid by the company prior to the payment in full of those certain senior subordinated promissory notes issued by the company pursuant to the securities purchase agreement. (b) subject to the provisions of this paragraph 2 of this section ii, the provisions of the securities purchase agreement and the provisions of a shareholders agreement among the company and certain shareholders of the company, as the same may be amended from time to time, the company may, in the board's discretion, declare and pay dividends or distributions, or make provision for the payment thereof, on any equity security of the company, but only if all accrued dividends and distributions on the series a preferred shares and the series b preferred shares shall have been paid and made in full prior to the date of any such declaration, payment, provision or distribution. (c) notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no dividends shall be declared, paid or distributed, or provision therefor made, on any common shares, unless simultaneously therewith there also shall be declared, paid or distributed, or provision therefor made, as the case may be, a dividend or distribution pro rata on each then outstanding series b preferred share to each holder thereof. for purposes of the foregoing, the number of series b preferred shares deemed to be outstanding with respect to each such holder shall be equal to the maximum number of common shares into which - 15 - 66 such holder's series b preferred shares would then be convertible upon exercise of the conversion rights described in paragraph 5 of this section ii. 3. liquidation rights. (a) in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the company, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities and obligations of the company, each holder of series b preferred shares then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the net assets of the company available for distribution to its shareholders prior and in preference to any payment or declaration and setting apart for payment of any amount in respect of the common shares, an amount equal to the sum of the following: (i) $7.13 per series b preferred share held by such holder, and (ii) the fair market value, reasonably determined in good faith by the board, of the evidences of indebtedness, assets and securities referred to in paragraph 5(e) hereof to which such holders would have been entitled to receive upon conversion of their series b preferred shares (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively the "series b liquidation preference"); if upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets to be distributed to the holders of the series a preferred shares and the series b preferred shares shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aggregate amount of the series a liquidation preference plus the series b liquidation preference, then all of the net assets of the company available for distribution to its shareholders shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the series a preferred shares and the series b preferred shares in proportion to the then applicable series a liquidation preference with respect to each series a preferred share and the then applicable series b liquidation preference with respect to each series b preferred share. (b) upon the completion of the distribution required by subparagraph (a), if assets of the company remain to be distributed, each holder of series b preferred shares shall be entitled to be paid out of the remaining assets of the company, as and when distributed, pro rata with the holders of common shares on each series b preferred share deemed to be outstanding. for purposes of the foregoing, the number of series b preferred shares deemed to be outstanding with respect to each such holder shall be equal to the maximum number of common shares into which such holder's series b preferred shares would then be convertible upon exercise of the conversion rights described in paragraph 5 of this section ii. (c) written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, stating a payment date, the place where such payment shall be made, an estimate of the net value that would be received by each such holder if all such holders converted all of their series b preferred shares immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, and containing a statement of or reference to applicable conversion rights, shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days prior to the payment day stated therein, to each holder of record of the series b preferred shares at such holder's address as shown in the records of the company. - 16 - 67 (d) whenever the distribution provided for in this paragraph 3 of this section ii shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the board. 4. voting rights. except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, the holders of series b preferred shares shall be entitled to vote on all matters upon which holders of common shares have the right to vote and, with respect to such vote, shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders' meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the company, and shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of common shares into which such series b preferred shares could then be converted, upon conversion pursuant to the conversion rights described in paragraph 5 of this section ii, at the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of shareholders is solicited. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, or to the extent class or series voting is otherwise required by law or agreement, the holders of series b preferred shares and common shares shall vote together as a single class and not as separate classes. 5. conversion. the holders of the series b preferred shares shall have the following conversion rights (the "conversion rights"): (a) right to convert. each series b preferred share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such shares, and prior to the closing date for any public offering giving rise to an automatic conversion as provided in paragraph 5(c) of this section ii, at the office of the company or any transfer agent for the series b preferred shares or common shares, into fully paid and nonassessable common shares, at the conversion price (as hereafter defined) therefor in effect at the time of conversion determined as provided herein. (b) conversion price. each series b preferred share shall be convertible into the number of common shares that results from dividing $7.13 by the conversion price per share (the "series b conversion price") in effect at the time of conversion of such series b preferred share. the series b conversion price for each series b preferred share at the original issue date shall be $7.13 and shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided herein. (c) automatic conversion. each series a preferred share which remains outstanding on the closing date for a public offering (the "registration date") shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the company, except as provided in clause (i) below, be converted on the same basis and at the same conversion price as if each holder thereof had properly exercised his right to convert on the date next preceding the registration date; provided, that (i) each holder of series a preferred shares shall have received written notice of the proposed public offering at least 30 days prior to the date the registration statement relating to that public offering - 17 - 68 becomes effective, (ii) such conversion shall be effective at the close of business on the registration date, and (iii) the company shall have no obligation to issue and deliver to any such holder of series a preferred shares on such date a certificate for the number of common shares to which such holder shall be entitled until such time as such holder has surrendered his certificate or certificates for his series a preferred shares, duly endorsed, at the office of the company or any transfer agent for the common shares, or the holder notifies the company that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the company to indemnify the company from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. all rights with respect to series a preferred shares outstanding on the registration date shall terminate on such registration date, except only the right of the holders of such shares to receive common shares upon surrender of their certificates for the series a preferred shares and their rights with respect to unpaid dividends described in paragraph 5(d) of this section i. (d) mechanics of conversion; unpaid dividends. before any holder of series b preferred shares shall be entitled to convert the same into common shares, such holder shall either (i) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the company or of any transfer agent for the series b preferred shares or common shares, or (ii) deliver an affidavit in favor of the company stating that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and containing an agreement satisfactory to the company to indemnify the company from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith, and shall give written notice by mail, postage prepaid, to the company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the number of series b preferred shares being converted and the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for common shares to which such holder shall be entitled. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the series b preferred shares to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the common shares issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such common shares issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such common shares on such date. all dividends accrued and unpaid prior to surrender of series b preferred shares surrendered for conversion shall at the option of the holders of series b preferred shares, either (i) be subtracted from the aggregate series b conversion price as in effect at the time of conversion or (ii) constitute a debt of the company payable to the converting shareholder, and no dividend or other distribution shall be paid on, declared or set apart for any common shares until such debt is fully paid or sufficient funds set apart for the payment thereof. (e) adjustment for stock splits and combinations. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the original issue date effect a subdivision or combination of any outstanding common shares, the series b conversion price then in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be proportionately adjusted by multiplying the then effective series b conversion price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number - 18 - 69 of common shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of common shares issued and outstanding immediately after such subdivision or combination. the number of common shares outstanding at any time shall, for the purposes of this paragraph 5(e) of this section ii, include the number of common shares into which any convertible securities of the company may be converted, or for which any warrant, option or rights of the company may be exchanged. any adjustment under this paragraph 5(e) of this section ii shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. (f) adjustments for other dividends and distributions. in the event the company at any time or from time to time after the original issue date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of common shares entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in (i) evidences of indebtedness of the company, (ii) assets of the company (other than cash), or (iii) securities of the company other than common shares, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of series b preferred shares shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of common shares receivable thereupon, the amount of such evidences, assets or securities that they would have received had they held, on such record date, the maximum number of common shares into which their series b preferred shares could then have been converted. (g) adjustment for reclassification, exchange or substitution. if the common shares issuable upon the conversion of the series b preferred shares shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this paragraph 5 of this section ii), then and in each such event the holder of each series b preferred share shall have the right thereafter to convert each such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change, by holders of the maximum number of common shares into which such series b preferred shares could have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. (h) reorganization, mergers, consolidations or sales of assets or capital stock. if at any time or from time to time there shall be (i) a capital reorganization of the common shares (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this paragraph 5 of this section ii) or (ii) a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange of the company with or into another corporation in which consolidation, merger or statutory share exchange persons owning capital stock of the company immediately prior to the consolidation, merger or share exchange own less than a majority of the voting stock of the resulting, surviving or exchanging corporation, or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all the company's properties and assets or capital stock to any other person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger, consolidation, share exchange or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders - 19 - 70 of the series b preferred shares shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon conversion of the series b preferred shares, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the company, or of the successor corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation, share exchange or sale, to which a holder of the maximum number of common shares into which such series b preferred shares would then be converted would have been entitled on such capital, reorganization, merger, share exchange, consolidation, or sale. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this paragraph 5 of this section ii with respect to the rights of the holders of the series b preferred shares after the reorganization, merger, share exchange, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this paragraph 5 of this section ii (including adjustment of the conversion price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the series b preferred shares) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. (i) change in series b conversion price upon issuance of securities. if the company issues or sells any common shares, other than common shares outstanding on the original issue date of the series b preferred shares and excluded shares, or issues any convertible security or option entitling the issuee to acquire common shares for a consideration per share less than the fair value in effect immediately prior to the time of such issuance or sale, then the series b conversion price shall be reduced to the lower of the following: (i) the price determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the sum of (x) the common shares outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale multiplied by the then current series b conversion price, plus (y) the aggregate consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale, by (ii) the common shares outstanding immediately after such issuance or sale; or (ii) the price determined by multiplying the then current series b conversion price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the common shares outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale, plus (b) the number of common shares that the aggregate consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale would purchase at the fair value on the date of such issuance or sale and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the common shares outstanding immediately after and giving effect to such issuance or sale. for the purposes of this paragraph 5(i) of this section ii, the following provisions shall also be applicable: (i) cash consideration. if the company issues the common shares, option or convertible security for cash, the consideration received by the company therefor (or, if such shares are offered by the company for subscription, the subscription price, or, if such shares are sold to underwriters or dealers for public offering without a subscription offering, the initial public offering price), after deducting therefrom any - 20 - 71 reasonable compensation or discount paid or allowed to underwriters or dealers or others performing similar services but without deducting therefrom any reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith, shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the company for such shares. (ii) non-cash consideration. if the company issues (other than upon conversion or issuance of a convertible security) the common shares, option or convertible security for a consideration wholly or partially other than cash, including services rendered, the fair value of such consideration, as determined by the board of directors of the company in good faith shall be deemed to be the value, for purposes of this section 5(i) of this section ii, of the consideration other than cash received by the company for such securities except that any common share, option or convertible security issued for services shall be deemed to be issued for no consideration. (iii) options and convertible securities. if the company issues or grants any option or any convertible security, and the inclusion thereof in the calculation of an adjusted series b conversion price pursuant to this paragraph 5(i) of this section ii would result in a series b conversion exercise price lower than if excluded, the total maximum number of common shares issuable upon the exercise of such option or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible security outstanding at the time such convertible security first becomes convertible or exchangeable shall be deemed to be issued and to be outstanding for the purposes of this paragraph 5(i) of this section ii as of the date of issue or grant of such option or, in the case of the issue or sale of a convertible security other than where the same is issuable upon the exercise of an option, as of the date of such issue or sale and to have been issued for the sum of the amount (if any) paid for such option or convertible security and the amount (if any) payable upon the exercise of such option or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible security at the time such convertible security becomes convertible or exchangeable. if the inclusion thereof would not result in a series b conversion price lower than if excluded, or if, at the time of exercise, the series b conversion price which would result from deeming such an option or convertible security to have been issued on the date of exercise is lower than that which resulted from adjustment of the exercise price at the time of issuance, such option or convertible security shall not be deemed to be issued until the close of business on the date of exercise, conversion or exchange and issuance of common shares pursuant thereto. (iv) reclassification. the reclassification of securities other than common shares into securities including common shares shall be deemed to involve the issuance for a consideration other than cash of such common shares at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such common shares. (j) change in exercise price or conversion rate of option or convertible securities. - 21 - 72 (i) not due to dilution. if the purchase price provided for in any option, or the additional consideration (if any) payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible security, or the rate at which any convertible security is convertible into or exchangeable for common shares changes at any time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), the series b conversion price in effect at the time of the change shall be readjusted to the series b conversion price that would have been in effect at such time had such option or convertible security still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. (ii) due to dilution. if the purchase price provided for in any option, or the additional consideration (if any) payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible security, or the rate at which any convertible security is convertible into or exchangeable for common shares is reduced at any time under or by reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to protect against dilution, then in case of the delivery of common shares upon the exercise of any such option or upon conversion or exchange of any such convertible security, the series b conversion price then in effect hereunder shall, upon issuance of such common shares, be adjusted to such amount as would have obtained had such option or convertible security never been issued and had adjustments been made only upon the issuance of the common shares delivered as aforesaid and for the consideration actually received for such option or convertible security and common shares. (k) termination of option or conversion rights. if any right to purchase common shares under any option or any right to convert or exchange any convertible security terminates or expires, the series b conversion price then in effect shall, upon such termination, be changed to the series b conversion price that would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such option or convertible security to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued, and the common shares thereunder shall no longer be deemed to be common shares outstanding. (l) successive changes. the provisions of this paragraph 5 of this section ii shall apply to successive issuances, dividends or other distributions, subdivisions and combinations on or of common shares after the original issue date of the series b preferred shares. (m) accountants' certificate of adjustment. in each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the series b conversion price for the number of common shares or other securities issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred shares, the company, at its expense, shall cause independent certified public accountants of recognized standing selected by the company (who may be the independent certified public accounts then auditing the books of the company) to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance herewith and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered - 22 - 73 holder of the series b preferred shares at the holder's address as shown in the company's books. the certificate shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based including a statement of (i) the consideration received or to be received by the company for any common shares issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold after the original issue date of the series b preferred shares that are not excluded shares, (ii) the series b conversion price at the time in effect for each series of the series b preferred shares, and (iii) the number of common shares and the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the series b preferred shares. (n) certain other actions prohibited. the company shall not by amendment of its articles of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of the series b preferred shares set forth in this section ii, but shall at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all of the such terms and shall take all such reasonable action as required to protect the conversion privilege of the holders of series b preferred shares against dilution or other impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company (i) shall not increase the par value of the common share above the series b conversion price, (ii) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate under local, state or federal laws of the united states of america in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable common shares upon the conversion exercise of all series b preferred shares from time to time outstanding and (iii) shall not take any action which results in any adjustment of the series b conversion price if the total number of common shares or other securities issuable after the action upon the conversion of all of the series b preferred shares would exceed the total number of common shares or other securities then authorized by the company's articles of incorporation and available for the purpose of issue upon such exercise. (o) notices of record date. in the event of (i) any taking by the company of a record of the holders of any class or series of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the company, any merger or consolidation of the company, or any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the company to any other corporation, entity or person, or any voluntary of involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the company, the company shall mail to each holder of series b preferred shares at least 30 days prior to the record date specified therein, a notice specifying (a) the date of on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (b) the date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (c) the time, if any is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of common shares (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common shares (or other securities) for securities or other - 23 - 74 property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. (p) fractional shares. no fractional common shares shall be issued upon conversion of series b preferred shares. in lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the company shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the fair value of one common share on the date of conversion. whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of series b preferred shares the holder is at the time converting into common shares and the number of common shares issuable upon such aggregate conversion. (q) reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued common shares, solely for the following purposes, (i) such number of common shares required to pay all dividends payable in common shares which the company by agreement is obligated, or may choose, to pay, (ii) such number of common shares as may from time to time be required, at such time, to be issued by the company upon exercise of all then-exercisable warrants and options to purchase common shares or the right to convert other convertible securities into common shares, and (iii) such number of its common shares as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding series b preferred shares. as a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would cause an adjustment to the conversion price, the company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued common shares to such number of shares as shall be sufficient in order that it may be validly and legally issue the common shares issuable based upon such adjusted conversion price.

shareholders agreement; d. the warrant agreement; and e. the form of senior subordinated note. based upon the foregoing and such investigation as we have deemed necessary, we are of the opinion that:

per share; three million (3,000,000) authorized shares of series a convertible preferred stock, $.001 par value per share; and four hundred thousand (400,000) authorized shares of class b preferred stock, $.001 par value per share. based solely upon our review of the company's stock transfer ledger and a certificate of an officer of the company that such ledger is accurate, of such authorized capital, there are 910,200 shares of series a common stock and 1,292,359 shares of series a convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding; and, upon closing of the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement and payment of the consideration specified therein by the purchaser, on the closing date there shall be 280,623 shares of series b convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding. subject to the understanding, with your permission, that no opinion is given herein as to the effect of any nonpayment of applicable stamp taxes with respect to the issuance and transfer of stock of the company, the outstanding shares of series a common stock and series b convertible preferred stock are, and upon payment therefor in accordance with the agreement the shares of preferred stock issuable to purchaser under the agreement will be, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and together all such shares comprise the totality of the company's outstanding capitalization as of the date hereof. 665,180 shares of the authorized series a common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement, and 280,623 shares of the authorized series a common stock have been reserved by the company for issuance upon the conversion of the preferred stock. 81 healthplan services corporation january 8, 1996 page 3 3. the company has

governmental authority of the united states or the state of georgia are required for the execution, delivery and performance of the investment documents by the company. the company is not subject to any law, rule or regulation of the united states or the state of georgia restricting in any way its ability to incur indebtedness or to issue shares of its capital stock or rights to acquire such shares as contemplated by the investment documents. 4. the company has duly authorized the execution and delivery of the investment documents and all other instruments or documents executed by the company in connection with the investment documents, and the company has duly executed and delivered the investment documents and such other instruments and documents. each of the investment documents is a valid and binding obligation of the company enforceable against the company in accordance with its respective terms. with your consent, the opinions set forth in this paragraph 4 are subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in appendix a as well as the qualifications of the accord to which this entire opinion is subject. 5. the issuance of the senior subordinated notes pursuant to the securities purchase agreement and payment of such notes in accordance with their terms, and the related issuance of warrant certificates pursuant to the warrant agreement and exercise of such warrants in accordance with their terms, do not violate any law of the state of georgia relating to interest and usury. 6. the execution and delivery of the investment documents by the company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, if the company were now to perform its obligations under the investment documents, will not (a) conflict with any provisions of the company's articles of incorporation or bylaws, (b) violate any provisions of any existing federal or state constitution, statute, law, rule, regulation or order to which the company or its assets are subject, or (c) result in a breach of or constitute a default (or an event of default which with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default) under, or cause or permit the acceleration of the maturity of or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, imposition of fees or penalties under, any material written agreement, which breach or default has not been waived. with your permission we have assumed that the term "material written agreement" used in clause (c) above includes only those agreements listed on schedules 2.2.13, 2.2.14 and 2.2.15 to the

is enforceable. 3. with respect to paragraph 5 above, we express no opinion as to whether the interest and other consideration received by purchaser in connection with its purchase of senior subordinated notes is usurious in the event section 7.11 of the securities purchase agreement is not enforceable, and such senior subordinated notes are required to be prepaid prior to april 8, 1997 by reason of (i) acceleration following the occurrence of an event of default or (ii) an event giving rise to a mandatory prepayment beyond the control of the company. furthermore, for the purposes of the prior sentence, we have assumed that the only interest paid or deemed paid on the notes is interest calculated at the rate of 18% per annum plus the value of the warrants issued pursuant to the warrant agreement, and that the only effect of such a required prepayment prior to april 8, 1997 is to truncate or shorten the period of time over which the rate of interest on the notes is calculated. 83 healthplan services corporation january 8, 1996 page 5 4. for purposes of paragraph 5 hereof, we have assumed that the right of purchaser to purchase shares of the company pursuant to

8 - 10 4.2.1 cash consideration. if the company issues the series a common stock, option or convertible security for cash, the consideration received by the company therefor (or, if such shares are offered by the company for subscription, the subscription price, or, if such shares are sold to underwriters or dealers for public offering without a subscription offering, the initial public offering price), after deducting therefrom any compensation or discount paid or allowed to underwriters or dealers or others performing similar services but without deducting therefrom any expenses incurred in connection therewith, shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the company for such shares. 4.2.2 non-cash consideration. if the company issues (other than upon conversion or issuance of a convertible security) the series a common stock, option or convertible security for a consideration wholly or partially other than cash, including services rendered, the fair value of such consideration, as determined by the board of directors of the company in good faith shall be deemed to be the value, for purposes of this section 4.2, of the consideration other than cash received by the company for such securities except that any series a common stock, option or convertible security issued for services shall be deemed to be issued for no consideration. 4.2.3 options and convertible securities. if the company issues or grants any option or any convertible security, and the inclusion thereof (as if exercised or converted) in the calculation of an adjusted exercise price pursuant to this section 4.2 would result in an exercise price lower than if such option or convertible security were excluded, then the total maximum number of shares of series a common stock issuable upon the exercise of such option or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible security outstanding at the time such convertible security first becomes convertible or exchangeable shall be deemed to be issued and to be outstanding for the purposes of this section 4.2 as of the date of issue or grant of such option or, in the case of the issue or sale of a convertible security other than where the same is issuable upon the exercise of an option, as of the date of such issue or sale and to have been issued for the sum of the amount (if any) paid for such option or convertible security and the amount (if any) payable upon the exercise of such option or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible security at the time such convertible security becomes convertible or exchangeable. if the inclusion of such option or convertible security (as if exercised or converted) would not result in an exercise price lower than if such option or convertible security were excluded, or if, at the time of exercise, the exercise price which would result from deeming such an option or convertible security to have been issued on the date of exercise is lower than that which resulted from adjustment of the exercise price at the time of issuance, then such option or convertible security shall not be deemed to be issued until the close of business on the date of exercise, conversion or exchange and issuance of series a common stock pursuant thereto. 4.2.4 reclassification. the reclassification of securities other than series a common stock into securities including series a common stock shall be deemed to - 9 - 11 involve the issuance for a consideration other than cash of such series a common stock at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such series a common stock. 4.3 change in exercise price or conversion rate of option or convertible securities. 4.3.1 not due to dilution. if the purchase price provided for in any option, or the additional consideration (if any) payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible security, or the rate at which any convertible security is convertible into or exchangeable for shares of series a common stock changes at any time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), the current exercise price in effect at the time of the change shall be readjusted to the exercise price that would have been in effect at such time had such option or convertible security still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. 4.3.2 due to dilution. if the purchase price provided for in any option, or the additional consideration (if any) payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible security, or the rate at which any convertible security is convertible into or exchangeable for shares of series a common stock is reduced at any time under or by reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to protect against dilution, then in case of the delivery of shares of series a common stock upon the exercise of any such option or upon conversion or exchange of any such convertible security, the current exercise price then in effect hereunder shall, upon issuance of such shares of series a common stock, be adjusted to such amount as would have obtained had such option or convertible security never been issued and had adjustments been made only upon the issuance of the shares of series a common stock delivered as aforesaid and for the consideration actually received for such option or convertible security and the series a common stock. 4.4 termination of option or conversion rights. if any right to purchase series a common stock under any option or any right to convert or exchange any convertible security terminates or expires, the current exercise price shall, upon such termination, be changed to the exercise price that would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such option or convertible security to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued, and the shares of series a common stock issuable thereunder shall no longer be deemed to be series a common stock outstanding. 4.5 stock splits; etc. 4.5.1 adjustment for stock splits and combinations. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the date of this agreement effect a subdivision or combination of any outstanding shares of series a common stock, the exercise price - 10 - 12 then in effect immediately before that subdivision or combination shall be proportionately adjusted by multiplying the then effective exercise price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of series a common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of series a common stock issued and outstanding immediately after such subdivision or combination. the number of shares of series a common stock outstanding at any time shall, for the purposes of this section 4.5, include the number of shares of series a common stock into which any convertible securities of the company may be converted, or for which any warrant, option or rights of the company may be exchanged. any adjustment under this section 4.5 shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. 4.5.2 adjustments for other dividends and distributions. in the event the company at any time or from time to time after the date of this agreement shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of series a common stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in (i) evidences of indebtedness of the company, (ii) assets of the company (other than cash), or (iii) securities of the company other than shares of series a common stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of warrants shall receive upon exercise thereof, in addition to the number of shares of series a common stock receivable upon the exercise thereof, the amount of such evidences, assets or securities that they would have received had they held, on such record date, the maximum number of shares of common stock they could have received upon exercise of their warrants. 4.5.3 adjustment for reclassification, exchange or substitution. if the series a common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this section 4.5), then and in each such event the holder of a warrant shall have the right thereafter to receive upon the exercise of such warrant the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change, by holders of the maximum number of shares of series a common stock as the holder of a warrant could have received upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. 4.5.2 reorganization, mergers, consolidations or sales of assets or capital stock. if at any time or from time to time there shall be (i) a capital reorganization of the series a common stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this section 4.5) or (ii) a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange of the company with or into another corporation in which consolidation, merger or statutory share exchange persons owning -

(b) priority in incidental registrations. if a registration pursuant to this section 2.2 involves an underwritten public offering and the managing underwriter advises the company that, in its view, the number of equity securities (including all registrable securities) which the company, the shareholder and any other persons intend to include in such registration exceeds the largest number of securities that can, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, be sold in such offering (the "maximum offering size"), the company will include in such registration, in the following priority, up to the maximum offering size: (i) first, all the priority securities (including any to be sold for the company's own account or for other holders of priority securities exercising demand registration rights), with such priorities among them as the company may determine; and (ii) second, the equity securities requested to be sold for the account of the shareholder and the holders of registrable securities and executive registrable securities (as defined in the consent and modification agreement dated january 8, 1996, by and among the company, brantley investment partners ii, l.p., sears pension trust and laurence h. powell) pro rata on the basis of the relative number of equity securities that all such persons have requested to be included in such registration; and (iii) third, the equity securities requested to be sold for the account of all other persons pro rata on the basis of the relative number of equity securities that all such persons have requested to be included in such registration; provided, however, that if securities owned by any executive officer of the company are included in the priority securities, then any registrable securities that the shareholder proposes to include in such registration shall also be deemed priority securities, and to the extent securities owned by any such executive officer are included in the registration, the shareholder's registrable securities shall be included in such registration pro rata with those owned by the shareholder and all executive officers on the basis of the relative number of equity securities that the shareholder and all such executive officers have requested to be included in such registration. - 5 - 7 2.3 holdback agreements.

9 - 11 of the shareholder to provide such person with a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) and such current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. the company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the shareholders provided in this section 2.6. 2.7 indemnification by holders of registrable securities and underwriters. the shareholder, if any of its registrable securities are included in any registration statement, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, its officers, directors and agents and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to the shareholder, but only with respect to information relating to the shareholder or its plan of distribution of the registrable securities furnished in writing by the shareholder or on the shareholder's behalf expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. the shareholder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the company provided in this section 2.7. in no event and under no circumstances shall shareholder be liable for indemnification in an amount in excess of the proceeds received by shareholder from the sale of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement. as a condition to including registrable securities in any registration statement filed in accordance with article ii hereof, the company may require that it shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from any underwriter to indemnify and hold it harmless to the extent customarily provided by underwriters with respect to similar securities. 2.8 conduct of indemnification proceedings. in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 2.6 or 2.7, such person (an "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses; provided that the failure of any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to notify. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, and the fees and expenses of the counsel of such indemnified party shall be at the expense of such indemnifying party if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) in the reasonable judgment - 10 - 12 of such indemnified party representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate because there may be defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings, in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the shareholder's indemnified parties and one counsel for the underwriters' indemnified parties (in each case in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. in the case of any such separate firms for the indemnified parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent, or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such proceeding. 2.9 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article ii is unavailable to the indemnified parties in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified parties in connection with the actions or inactions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses. the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of the shareholder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and the shareholder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 2.9, the shareholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by the shareholder exceeds the amount of any damages which the shareholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. -
