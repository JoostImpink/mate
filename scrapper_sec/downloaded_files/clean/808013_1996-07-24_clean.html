constitute valid, legal, binding and enforceable agreements of the investor. each investor acquiring preferred shares in exchange for a note and purchase warrant represents and warrants, severally but not jointly, that such investor is the sole legal and beneficial owner of all interests in such note and purchase warrants, free and clear of all liens, claims, charges, security interests or other encumbrances of any kind or nature, and that, upon the delivery of the note and purchase warrants to the company at the closing, all legal and beneficial interests in the note and purchase warrants

any transfer of the preferred shares or the warrants. no broker-dealer acted on behalf of the investor in connection with the offer or sale of the preferred shares or the warrants. 3.3 restrictions on transferability. the investor understands that because the preferred shares and the warrants have not been registered under the securities act and applicable state securities laws (based in part on the representations, warranties and agreements of the investor contained herein), it cannot dispose of any of the preferred shares, conversion shares, warrants or warrant shares unless they are subsequently registered under the securities act or exemptions from registration are available, and that the investor must bear the economic risk of an investment in such securities as a result

public sales of the preferred shares and/or conversion shares and/or the warrants and/or the warrant shares without registration under the securities act, rule 144 is not now available and there is no assurance that it will become available for such purpose. by reason of these restrictions, the investor understands that it may be required to hold the preferred shares, the conversion shares, the warrants and the warrant shares for an indefinite period of time. the investor understands that each certificate representing the preferred shares, conversion shares, warrants and warrant shares, will bear appropriate state "blue sky" legends and a legend substantially to the effect that: "the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended. these securities may not be sold, mortgaged, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred without an effective registration statement for such securities under the securities act of 1933,

any such subsidiary possessed such information or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense) necessary to verify the accuracy of any information furnished to it or to which it had

(e) if the indemnification provided for in this section 5 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under section 5.7(a) or section 5.7(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to in section 5.7(a) or section 5.7(b) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements, omissions, actions or inactions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party, any action or inaction by any such party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, omission, action or inaction. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) pursuant to this section 5.7(e) shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim (which shall be limited as provided in section 5.7(c) if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof) which is the subject of this section 5.7(e). no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 5.7(e) of written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing with respect to which a claim for contribution may be made against an indemnifying party under this section 5.7(e), such indemnified party shall, if a claim for contribution in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof (if the notice specified in section 5.6(c) has not been given with respect to such action); provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any obligation to provide contribution which it may have to any indemnified party under this section 5 except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by the failure to give notice. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account the equitable considerations referred to in this paragraph. 32 33 if indemnification is available under this section 5, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the fullest extent provided in sections 5.7(a) and 5.7(b), without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this paragraph. the provisions of this paragraph shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party, and shall survive the transfer of securities by any such party. in connection with any underwritten offering contemplated by this agreement which includes registrable securities, the company and all sellers of registrable securities included in any registration statement shall agree to customary provisions for indemnification and contribution (consistent with the other provisions of this section 5) in respect of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the underwriters of such offering. 5.8 underwriting. if any registration effected pursuant to section 5.2 is an underwritten offering, or a best efforts underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering shall be mutually agreed upon by the company and the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be included in such offering. if any piggyback registration is an underwritten offering, the company shall have the right to select the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers to administer the offering; provided, that such investment bankers and managers must be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be registered in such piggyback registration, if any person (other than the company) has the right, in the case of an underwritten secondary offering, to select the same. 5.9 rule 144 requirements. the company covenants to each holder that, to the extent that the company shall be required to do so under the exchange act, the company shall (a) timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the exchange act or the securities act (including, but not limited to, the reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the exchange act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of rule 144 adopted by the commission under the securities act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the commission thereunder, and (b) take such further action as any holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitations of the exemption provided by rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of any holder, the company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 5.10 limitations on subsequent registration rights. from and after the date of this agreement, the company will not enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is inconsistent with or violates the rights granted to the holders of registrable securities in this agreement. 33 34 5.11 obligations of holders in a registration. each holder agrees as follows: (a) if any registrable securities are included in a registration statement, the holder thereof will not (until further notice) effect sales thereof after receipt of telegraphic or written notice from the company to suspend sales to permit the company to correct or update a registration statement or prospectus; provided, that the obligations of the company with respect to maintaining any registration statement current and effective shall be extended by a period of days equal to the period said suspension is in effect. (b) if any registrable securities are being registered in any registration pursuant to this agreement, the holder thereof will comply with all anti-stabilization, manipulation and similar provisions of section 10 of the exchange act, as amended, and any rules promulgated thereunder by the commission and, at the request of the company, will execute and deliver to the company and to any underwriter participating in such offering, an appropriate agreement to such effect. (c) at the end of any period during which the company is obligated to keep a registration statement current and effective as described herein, the holders of registrable securities included in the registration statement shall discontinue sales thereof pursuant to such registration statement. (d) if any registrable securities are included in a registration statement, the holder thereof will (i) furnish to the company in writing such information as is reasonably requested by the company for use in the registration statement (or any prospectus included therein), (ii) complete and execute all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required by an underwriter relating to the terms of the underwriting agreements and (iii) only sell such registrable securities on the basis provided in any such underwriting agreements. 5.12 miscellaneous. in connection with its obligations under this section 5, the company shall have no obligation (a) to assist or cooperate in the offering or disposition of the registrable securities or (b) to obtain a commitment from an underwriter relative to the sale of the registrable securities. section 6. default remedies. 6.1 remedies. at any time after an event of default (as defined in section 4.1(d) other than an event of default relating to sections 4.16, 4.20 or 4.22), unless waived pursuant to the terms of section 9.1, the investors shall have the right to sell ("remedy") to the company all or part of the preferred shares held by such investors on the remedy date (as defined below) (the "remedy securities") pursuant to the following terms: (a) in the event investors wish to exercise their right to sell the remedy securities, the investors shall notify the company at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective remedy date of their intention to exercise their remedy right, the number of the remedy securities, and their 34 35 intended remedy date, which date shall be no more than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the notice; provided, however, that if a "fair market value" determination made pursuant to section 6.1(b) below extends beyond the effective remedy date as specified in the notice above, then such effective remedy date shall be ten (10) days after such "fair market value" determination. for purposes of this section 6, the term "remedy date" shall mean each date on which investors exercise their right to remedy pursuant to this section 6, and investors shall be deemed to have exercised a remedy right only upon the closing of such remedy right as specified in section 6.1(e) hereto. (b) the purchase price per share (the "remedy price") of the remedy securities shall be the greater of (x) the "fair market value" (plus, if not taken into account by the party or parties determining the fair market value pursuant to (b)(i), (b)(ii) or (b)(iii) below, (a) any accrued or declared but unpaid dividends payable on each of the remedy securities and (b) interest, if any) of each of such remedy securities or (y) the initial purchase price per preferred share hereunder (plus any accrued or declared but unpaid dividends payable on the remedy securities, plus interest, if any). for purposes of this section 6, the term "fair market value" shall mean the fair market value of such security on the remedy date, determined as follows: (i) by written agreement of the company and the investors exercising such remedy right; or (ii) if the company and the investors exercising such remedy right fail to reach a written agreement within thirty (30) days after the notice given by the investors exercising such remedy right pursuant to section 6.1(a) above, the company and the investors exercising such remedy right shall together appoint an independent appraiser to determine the "fair market value" of the remedy securities, which shall be binding on the parties; or (iii) if (x) the company and the investors are unable to agree upon the choice of an independent appraiser under (ii) hereof within forty (40) days after the notice given by the investors pursuant to section 6.1(a) or (y) such appraiser, after being duly selected, fails to determine the "fair market value" within thirty (30) days of being selected, then the company, on the one hand, and the investors exercising such remedy right, on the other hand, shall each appoint, within ten (10) days following the expiration of the applicable time period under (x) or (y) above, an independent appraiser, and the two appraisers together shall determine the "fair market value." if only one appraiser is appointed during the 10-day period referred to above, then such appraiser shall alone determine the "fair market value," which determination shall be binding on the company and the investors exercising such remedy right. if both appraisers are appointed within such 10-day period, and within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the second of the two appraisers, they cannot agree on the "fair market value" of the remedy securities, then each appraiser shall prepare a separate appraisal report of the fair market value ("fmv") of the company and the "fair market value" of the remedy securities within sixty (60) days after the appointment of the second of the two appraisers, and if the lower of the two fmvs of the company is equal to at least 85% of the higher fmv 35 36 of the company, then the "fair market value" of the remedy securities shall be the average of the "fair market value" of the remedy securities as determined by the two appraisers. if only one of the appraisers submits an appraisal report on or before such 60th day, then the "fair market value" of the remedy securities shall be the "fair market value" of the remedy securities as determined by such report; or (iv) if neither of the appraisers submits an appraisal request on or before such 60th day, or if both appraisers submit an appraisal report but the averaging requirements set forth in (iii) above are not met, then the two appraisers shall promptly appoint a third appraiser who shall determine the "fair market value" of the remedy securities. if the two appraisers fail to appoint a third appraiser as required hereunder, either party shall have the right to submit the determination to arbitration under the rules and procedures of the american arbitration association. (c) the appraisers and arbitrators shall have access to all books and records of the company and the subsidiaries and shall have the right to examine all of its accounts, books, assets and equipment and do all things fully and completely to enable them to arrive at the fmv of the company and the "fair market value" of the remedy securities. the cost of any appraisal proceedings shall be paid one-half ( 1/2) by the company and one-half ( 1/2) by the investors exercising such remedy right (pro rata). an appraiser making an appraisal pursuant to this agreement shall assume an all cash sale with respect to the subject remedy securities and shall assume that the restrictions on transfer specified in this agreement, the stockholders' agreement and/or any applicable federal or state securities law restrictions on transfer are not applicable to such remedy securities. all appraisers appointed shall be experienced and knowledgeable in the industry or industries in which the company does business. the "fair market value" determination pursuant to section 6.1(b)(iii) or section 6.1(b)(iv) hereof, as the case may be, shall be binding on the company and the investors exercising such remedy right. (d) if the company is unable to purchase all remedy securities required to be purchased on a remedy date due to federal or state law restrictions or due to any restriction imposed by any listing agreement with any securities exchange to which the company is then a party, remedy securities shall be repurchased (on a pro rata basis from the holders of the remedy securities based upon the common stock equivalents) from time to time, to the extent the company is legally permitted to do so, and the remedy obligations of the company under this section 6 will be a continuing obligation until the company's repurchase of all such remedy securities. (e) on each remedy date (including any subsequent purchase closing date if multiple purchases result from the application of section 6.1(d)), the remedy closing shall occur at the company's principal office. at the remedy closing, to the extent applicable, the investors exercising such remedy right shall deliver the remedy securities being sold, duly endorsed in blank, accompanied by such supporting documents as may be necessary to pass to the company good title to the remedy securities, free and clear of all liens (other than restrictions under applicable securities laws and/or the stockholders' agreement). in consideration therefor, the company shall deliver to each of the investors exercising such remedy right (i) payment, by 36 37 certified check, cashier's check or wire transfer, of the aggregate remedy price or (ii) at the option of the company, a full recourse promissory note or notes evidencing the aggregate remedy price (the "remedy notes"). each remedy note shall be secured by a pledge from the company of the remedy securities for which the remedy note is executed, and the company hereby agrees to take all actions and execute all documents (in form reasonably satisfactory to the investors exercising such remedy right) necessary or appropriate to properly and fully secure each remedy note with the remedy securities transferred in exchange therefor. in addition, each remedy note shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to the investors exercising such remedy right and shall in any case, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) have a term of three (3) years, (ii) provide for repayment of the aggregate remedy price at a rate of no less than one-third per year, with principal and interest payable in equal semi-annual installments, (iii) provide that the unpaid balance of the remedy note shall accrue simple interest at the rate of 13.5% per annum from the date of issuance until full payment of the aggregate remedy price is made and (iv) provide that all amounts due under such remedy note may be accelerated and declared immediately payable upon a default in any payment by the company under such remedy note, which is not cured within sixty (60) days. 6.2 transfer of remedy right. the remedy right granted hereunder is not assignable except by an investor to any party who acquires at least fifty percent (50%) of the preferred shares originally issued to such investor hereunder (appropriately adjusted for recapitalizations, stock splits and the like). section 7. right of first refusal on issuance of new securities 7.1 grant of right. the company hereby grants to each investor, for so long as the investors hold at least twenty percent (20%) of the preferred shares, the right of first refusal to purchase its pro rata share (as defined below) of new securities (as defined below) which the company may, from time to time, propose to sell and issue. a "pro rata share," for purposes of this right of first refusal, is the ratio that (a) the sum of the total number of shares of common stock which are then held or obtainable by the investor (including those which each such investor has the right to obtain pursuant to exercise or conversion of any option, warrant, right or convertible security) bears to (ii) the sum of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding and which are issuable pursuant to exercise or conversion of any then outstanding options, warrants, rights or convertible securities. 7.2 new securities. except as set forth below, "new securities" shall mean any shares of capital stock of the company, including common stock and any series of preferred stock, whether now authorized or not, and rights, options or warrants to purchase said shares of common stock or preferred stock, and securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become, convertible into or exchangeable for said shares of common stock or preferred stock. notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "new securities" does not include (a) the conversion shares, (b) warrant shares, (c) securities issued pursuant to the acquisition of another corporation by the company by merger, purchase of all or substantially all of the assets or other reorganization whereby the company or its stockholders own more than seventy- five percent (75%) of the voting power of the surviving or successor corporation, (d) securities issued or sold 37 38 in connection with the option pool, (e) securities issued pursuant to any rights, agreements or convertible securities, including, without limitation, options and warrants, provided that the rights of first refusal established by this section 7 applied with respect to the initial sale or grant by the company of such rights, agreements or convertible securities, (f) securities issued pursuant to the conversion of shares of the company's series d preferred stock or series e preferred stock, (g) securities issued pursuant to any warrant, option,

environmental group, inc. by the company or (j) securities issued in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization by the company not involving new financing. 7.3 notice. in the event the company proposes to undertake an issuance or sale of new securities, it shall give the investors written notice of its intention, describing the amount and type of new securities, and the price and general terms upon which the company proposes to issue the same. each investor shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of any such notice to agree to purchase up to its respective pro rata share of such new securities for the price and upon the general terms specified in the notice by giving written notice to the company and stating therein the quantity of new securities to be purchased. 7.4 eligible sales to third parties. after giving the notice and opportunity for each investor to participate as required under section 7.3 above, the company shall have one hundred and twenty (120) days thereafter to issue and sell the new securities not elected nor eligible to be purchased by the investors at the price and upon the terms no more favorable to the purchasers of such securities than specified in the company's notice under section 7.3. in the event the company has not sold such new securities within said one hundred and twenty (120) day period, the company shall not thereafter issue or sell any new securities without first offering such securities in the manner provided above. 7.5 assignment. the right of first refusal hereunder is not assignable except by any investor to any party who acquires at least fifty percent (50%) of the preferred shares originally issued to such investor hereunder and/or conversion shares and the warrant shares (appropriately adjusted for recapitalizations, stock splits and the like). 7.6 accredited investor. the rights granted to the investors pursuant to this section 7 shall only be exercisable by an investor who demonstrates, at the time of exercise of such rights, to the reasonable satisfaction of the company, that (a) such investor is an "accredited investor," as defined in regulation d promulgated under the securities act or (b) another exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act is available. 38 39 section 8. special default. 8.1 violation in use of proceeds. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any breach by the company of the reported use of proceeds pursuant to section 4.3 hereof (without the prior written consent of nbcc) shall give each investor the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to demand (and receive, upon thirty (30) days' notice of such demand) repayment by the company of the amounts paid by such investor to the company hereunder (plus interest thereon at the highest legal rate permitted under applicable law or sba regulation). all such amounts due hereunder shall be paid to such investor by certified check, cashier's check or wire transfer. in the event an investor demands and receives such repayment, the preferred shares and warrants issued to such investor pursuant to this agreement (and the conversion shares and warrant shares into which such preferred shares or warrants may from time to time have been converted or exercised for) shall be surrendered by such investor to the company, duly endorsed in blank, accompanied by such supporting documents as may be necessary to pass to the company good title to such securities, free and clear of all liens (other than restrictions under applicable securities laws and/or the stockholders' agreement) and, at the option of the company, canceled by the company. notwithstanding the foregoing, however, to the extent that sba regulations permit the company to cure any default under this section 8.1, the company may cure such default prior to the expiration of the 30-day notice period above, and in such case the rights of the investors to require the company to repurchase any of their preferred shares, warrants, conversion shares and warrant shares to the company under this section 8.1 shall cease with respect to such default. any such cure shall in no way be deemed to limit an investor's rights under this section 8.1 with respect to any subsequent default. nothing in this section 8.1 shall be construed to restrict or otherwise limit an investor's right to seek all other remedies available to it as provided hereunder, or at law or in equity, including the remedy of specific performance. the provisions of this section 8.1 shall expire upon evidence satisfactory to nbcc that the company has utilized the proceeds received pursuant to this agreement in a manner that is consistent with their use reported to the sba on sba form 1031. the rights of an investor pursuant to this section 8 shall not be transferrable or assignable except to an affiliate of such investor. section 9. general. 9.1 amendments, waivers and consents. except as otherwise provided herein, any consents required and any waiver, amendment or other action of the investors or holders of the preferred shares and warrants (or conversion shares and warrant shares) may be made by consent(s) in writing signed by at least two (2) holders of preferred shares holding in the aggregate at least two-thirds of the preferred shares and warrants (including, for such purposes, any conversion shares or warrant shares into which any of the preferred shares or warrants have been converted into or exercised for that have not been sold to the public). any amendment or waiver made according to this paragraph will be binding upon each holder of any securities purchased under this agreement at the time outstanding (including securities into which such securities have been converted) and each future holder. any amendment or waiver by the company must be made in writing. 39 40 9.2 survival; assignability of rights. all representations of the parties made in this agreement and in the certificates, exhibits, schedules or other written information delivered or furnished by one party to the other in connection with this agreement will survive the delivery of the preferred shares for a period of three (3) years. except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, all covenants and agreements made in this agreement will survive closing, and will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties' successors and assigns. 9.3 governing law. this agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware, without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof. 9.4 counterparts. this agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which will be taken to be an original, but such counterparts will together constitute one document. 9.5 notices and demands. any notice or demand which is permitted or required hereunder will be deemed to have been sufficiently received (except as otherwise provided herein) (a) upon receipt when personally delivered, (b) one (1) day after sent by overnight delivery or telecopy providing confirmation or receipt of delivery, or (c) three (3) days after being sent by certified or registered mail, postage and charges prepaid, return receipt requested to the following addresses: if to the company or an operating subsidiary, at the address as shown on the signature page of this agreement, or at any other address designated by such corporation to the investors in writing; if to the investors, at its mailing address as shown on exhibit a, or at any other address designated by the investors to the company in writing. 9.6 severability. if any provision of this agreement is held invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, and such invalid provision will be modified to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. any such invalidity will not invalidate the remainder of this agreement. 9.7 expenses; specific enforcement. the company will pay (a) all costs and expenses that it incurs with respect to the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this agreement, and (b) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the investors and the reasonable legal fees and disbursements incurred by one counsel for the investors (up to a maximum of $25,000) with respect to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. the investors, other than pecaut capital investors, l.p. and pecaut partners, a limited partnership, designate jenkens & gilchrist, a professional corporation, as their counsel for this transaction. the parties agree that the rights created by this agreement are unique and that the loss of any such right is not susceptible to monetary quantification. consequently, the parties agree that an action for specific enforcement (including for temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief) is a proper remedy for the breach of the provisions of this agreement, without the necessity of proving actual damages. if either party is required to take any action to enforce its rights under this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to its reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, in connection with any such action. 40 41 9.8 entire agreement. this agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto) and the agreements referenced as exhibits to this agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties, and supersede any prior agreements. 41 42 the undersigned have executed this

or (c) on the anniversary date of this agreement in the year 2004; or (d) in addition (and not by way of limitation of the foregoing), all rights and obligations of any management stockholder and his or her permitted transferees under this agreement shall immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the termination of such management stockholder's employment in all capacities with the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, regardless of the cause of such termination. 12. amendment. any provision of this agreement may be amended or the observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of the company, the management stockholders and their permitted transferees holding a majority in interest of the shares of common stock then held by such management stockholders or their permitted transferees on any applicable date and the holders of a majority in interest of the total number of shares of common stock, preferred stock and warrants (counted on an as-converted into common stock basis) then held by the investors and the investors' permitted transferees. any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this section 12 shall be binding upon the investors, each management stockholder, each permitted transferee and the company. 13. governing law. this agreement and the legal relations between the parties arising hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware. the parties hereto agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the state of texas with respect to the breach or interpretation of this agreement or the enforcement of any and all rights, duties, liabilities, obligations, powers, and other relations between the parties arising under this agreement. 14. entire agreement. this agreement, and the purchase agreement, including all exhibits, schedules and attachments thereto, constitute the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties regarding the matters set forth herein. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto. 15. notices, etc. except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed 8 9 effectively given upon personal delivery to the party to be notified or three (3) days after deposit with the united states mail, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed (a) if to an investor, at such investor's address as set forth on exhibit a attached to the purchase agreement, or at such other address as such investor shall have furnished to the company in writing in accordance with this section 15, (b) if to a management stockholder, at such address as such management stockholder shall have last furnished the company in writing, or (c) if to the company, at its principal office. 16. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. 17. specific performance. the company, the management stockholders and the investors agree that the rights created by this agreement are unique, and that the loss of any such right is not susceptible to monetary quantification. consequently, the parties agree that an action for specific performance (including for temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief) of the obligations created by this agreement is a proper remedy for the breach of the provisions of this agreement, without the necessity of proving actual damages. if the parties hereto are forced to institute legal proceedings to enforce their rights in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, in connection with any such action. 9 10 in witness whereof, the parties hereto have executed this agreement as of the date first above written.
