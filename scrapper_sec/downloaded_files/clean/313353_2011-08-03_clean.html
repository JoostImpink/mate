series a preferred warrant merger consideration &#148;). at the effective time of the merger, pursuant to the termination agreement, each outstanding class b warrant will be cancelled in exchange for the payment to each holder of a class b warrant of an amount in cash equal to (x) the adjusted common merger consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of company common stock that would have been issuable upon a cashless exercise of such class b warrant immediately prior to the effective time of the merger based on the adjusted common merger consideration (the &#147;

senior note merger consideration &#148;). at the effective time of the merger, all outstanding restricted stock awards (&#147; company restricted shares &#148;) will automatically become fully vested and will be paid in the same fashion as other shares of company common stock. the merger agreement defines &#147;
