for exercise of combined company rights (a) each combined company right may be exercised by the holder thereof at any time during the combined company rights exercise period to purchase a portion of the combined company rights aggregate consideration equal to the quotient that results from dividing (i) one by (ii) the number of combined company rights issued under the plan (the exercise of any combined company rights in such manner being referred to as a "primary exercise"). although a holder of combined company rights may exercise all or any portion of such holder's combined company rights pursuant to a primary exercise, all such combined company rights that are to be exercised by such holder pursuant to a primary exercise shall be exercised concurrently. any holder of combined company rights that seeks to exercise all of such holder's combined company rights pursuant to a primary exercise may also seek to exercise a notional number of additional combined company rights not to exceed the difference that results from subtracting (i) the number of combined company rights sought to be exercised by such holder pursuant to a primary exercise from (ii) the number of combined company rights issued under the plan (the exercise of any combined company rights in such manner being referred to as an "oversubscription exercise"). any exercise of combined company rights pursuant to a primary exercise or an oversubscription exercise will be irrevocable. any exercise of combined company rights pursuant to an oversubscription exercise will be subject to prorationing as described in clause (d) below in the event that the total number of combined company rights sought to be exercised pursuant to primary exercises and oversubscription exercises exceeds the number of combined company rights issued under the plan. (b) in order for any primary exercise (and any related oversubscription exercise) of combined company rights to be valid and effective, the holder of combined company rights seeking to effect such primary exercise must have been the holder of the allowed class mk-8 interests in respect of which the combined company rights subject to such primary exercise were issued pursuant to section iii.b.8 of the plan and must deliver to the disbursing agent prior to the combined company rights expiration date a properly completed and duly executed exercise notice which (i) indicates the number of combined company rights sought to be exercised pursuant to a primary exercise and the number, if any, of combined company rights sought to be exercised pursuant to an oversubscription exercise and (ii) is accompanied by a certified check or bank draft drawn upon a united states bank or wire transfer in an amount equal to the sum of (a) the product of the combined company rights exercise price and the number of combined company rights sought to be exercised pursuant to a primary exercise and (b) the product of the combined company rights exercise price and the number, if any, of combined company rights sought to be exercised pursuant to an oversubscription exercise. the foregoing items will not be deemed to have been timely delivered to the disbursing agent (and thus the attempted exercise of combined company rights pursuant to a primary exercise and/or an oversubscription exercise will not be valid or effective) unless they are actually received by the disbursing agent at the address specified therefor in the instructions (the "exercise instructions") accompanying the form of exercise notice to be provided pursuant to clause (e) below prior to the combined rights expiration date and are completed and executed in conformity with the exercise instructions. (c) as promptly as practicable following the combined company rights expiration date, the disbursing agent will mail to each holder of combined company rights that has sought to exercise combined company rights in a primary exercise and/or an oversubscription exercise a written statement specifying the number of combined company rights that were validly and effectively exercised by such holder (after giving effect, if applicable, to prorationing pursuant to clause (d) below of combined company rights sought to be exercised by such holder pursuant to an oversubscription exercise) and the quantity or magnitude of each form of consideration included in the portion of the combined company rights aggregate consideration purchased upon such exercise of such combined company rights, together with (i) a check in the amount of the sum of the portion of the cash distribution so purchased, the portion of the mk rail note proceeds so purchased and, if applicable, the amount being refunded (without interest) in respect of the combined company rights exercise price relating to any combined company rights that were not validly and effectively exercised by such holder as a result of untimeliness, noncompliance with the requirements specified herein or in the exercise instructions, prorationing pursuant to clause (d) below or otherwise and (ii) stock certificates representing the shares of each class of stock so purchased. no fractional shares of stock will be delivered upon the exercise of any combined company right. when any exercise of combined company rights would otherwise result in the purchase of a number of shares of any class of stock that is not a whole number, the actual number of shares of stock of such class that will be purchased upon such exercise shall be rounded to the next higher or lower number as follows: (a) fractions of 1/2 or greater will be rounded to the next higher whole number and (b) fractions of less than 1/2 will be rounded to the next lower whole number. (d) in the event that the total number of combined company rights sought to be exercised pursuant to primary exercises and oversubscription exercises exceeds the number of combined company rights issued under the plan, (i) all combined company rights that shall have otherwise been validly and effectively exercised pursuant to primary exercises shall be deemed to have been validly and effectively exercised and (ii) the number of combined company rights that shall be deemed to have been validly and effectively exercised by any holder of combined company rights pursuant to an oversubscription exercise (assuming that all other requirements for valid and effective exercise shall have been satisfied) shall be determined by (a) multiplying the aggregate number of combined company rights that were not validly and effectively exercised pursuant to primary exercises by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of combined company rights issued under the plan to such holder and the denominator of which shall be the number of combined company rights issued under the plan to all holders of combined company rights who shall have exercised combined company rights pursuant to oversubscription exercises and (b) eliminating any resulting fractions. if the prorationing pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence would otherwise result in any holder being deemed to have validly and effectively exercised a greater number of combined company rights than such holder sought to exercise pursuant to its oversubscription exercise, then such holder will be deemed to have validly and effectively exercised only that number of combined company rights which such holder sought to exercise pursuant to its oversubscription exercise and any remaining combined company rights not otherwise deemed to have been validly and effectively exercised will be deemed to have been validly and effectively exercised by other holders of combined company rights that have made oversubscription exercises on the basis set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. this proration process will be repeated as necessary until all combined company rights shall have been deemed to have been validly and effectively exercised by such holders. (e) in order to facilitate the exercise of combined company rights, the disbursing agent will mail on or as promptly as is practicable after the applicable distribution record date to each holder of allowed class mk-8 interests as of the applicable distribution record date a form of the exercise notice (an "exercise notice") together with the exercise instructions (which will include instructions for the proper completion and due execution of the exercise notice and timely delivery thereof, together with payment of the applicable exercise price for combined company rights sought to be exercised, to the disbursing agent and may specify other requirements relating to the valid and effective exercise of combined company rights). all determinations as to proper completion, due execution, timeliness, eligibility, prorationing and other matters affecting the validity or effectiveness of any attempted exercise of any combined company rights shall be made by the disbursing agent, whose determination shall be final and binding. the disbursing agent in its sole discretion may waive any defect or irregularity, or permit a defect or irregularity to be corrected within such time as it may determine or reject the purported exercise of any combined company right subject to any such defect or irregularity. deliveries required to be received by the disbursing agent in connection with a purported exercise of combined company rights will not be deemed to have been so received or accepted until actual receipt thereof by the disbursing agent shall have occurred and any defects or irregularities shall have been waived or cured within such time as the disbursing agent may determine in its sole discretion. neither the debtor nor the disbursing agent will have any obligation to give notice to any holder of a combined company right of any defect or irregularity in connection with any purported exercise thereof or incur any liability as a result of any failure to give any such notice. c. corporate governance, directors and officers, employment-related agreements and compensation programs 1. certificate of incorporation and bylaws (a) combined company/reorganized mk as of the effective date, the combined company certificate of incorporation and the combined company bylaws shall be substantially in the forms of exhibits c and b, respectively, to the plan. the combined company certificate of incorporation shall, among other things: (i) prohibit the issuance of nonvoting equity securities, to the extent required by section 1123(a) of the bankruptcy code;

such claim), the claims, rights and causes of action of any nature that the debtor or reorganized debtor may hold against the holder of such allowed claim; provided, however, that neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the allowance of any claim hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release by the debtor or reorganized debtor of any such claims, rights and causes of action that the debtor or reorganized debtor may possess against such holder. h. surrender of cancelled debt instruments or securities as a condition precedent to receiving any distribution pursuant to the plan on

certificate within one year after the effective date shall have its claim for a distribution pursuant to the plan on account of such existing loan document or capital stock certificate discharged and

is terminated, new mk securities) held for distribution on account of such claim shall be disposed of pursuant to the provisions set forth in section vii.c.2 above. i. restrictions related to mk rail stock each recipient of mk rail stock under the plan shall be deemed to be bound by the mk rail stockholder agreement, whether or not such recipient executed such agreement and shall not be permitted

as of the petition due in the amounts set forth in such stipulations of amount and nature of claim and shall not be treated as disputed claims. 2. resolution or estimation of claims the debtor or the reorganized debtor may, at any time, request that the bankruptcy court estimate any contingent or unliquidated claim pursuant to section 502(c) of the bankruptcy code, irrespective of whether the debtor or reorganized debtor has previously objected to such claim or whether the bankruptcy court has ruled on any such objection. the bankruptcy court will retain jurisdiction to estimate any contingent or unliquidated claim at any time during litigation concerning any objection to the claim, including during the pendency of any appeal relating to any such objection. if the bankruptcy court estimates any contingent or unliquidated claim, that estimated amount will constitute either the allowed amount of such claim or a maximum limitation on such claim, as determined by the bankruptcy court. if the estimated amount constitutes a maximum limitation on such claim, the debtor or reorganized debtor may elect to pursue any supplemental proceedings to object to any ultimate payment on account of such claim. all of these claims objection, estimation and resolution procedures are cumulative and not necessarily exclusive of one another. in addition to seeking estimation of claims as provided in this section viii.b.2, the debtor or reorganized debtor may resolve or adjudicate any disputed claim in the manner in which the amount of such claim and the rights of the holder

provided, however, that before filing a registration statement or -------- ------- prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, including documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of the registration statement and prior to effectiveness thereof, the company shall use its reasonable efforts to furnish to one firm of legal counsel for the selling holders (selected by the majority selling holders) copies of all such documents in the form substantially as proposed to be filed with the commission at least five business days prior to filing for review and comment by such counsel. 4.2. (i) use the company's reasonable best efforts to keep the relevant registration statement continuously effective (x) if a demand registration statement, for up to 90 days or until such earlier date as of which all the registrable securities under the demand registration statement shall have been disposed of in the manner described in the demand registration statement, and (y) if a shelf registration statement, subject to the immediately following sentence, for three years. as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of any fact or event that makes untrue any statement of a material fact made in the shelf registration statement or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the shelf registration statement in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, the company shall prepare and file a supplement or amendment to the shelf registration statement or related prospectus, or a document incorporated therein by reference, so that such shelf registration statement and related prospectus shall not contain any such untrue statement of a material fact or any such omission of a material fact; provided, however, that if the board -------- ------- of directors of the company determines, in its good faith reasonable judgment, that the transfer of registrable securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement would materially interfere with, or require the premature disclosure of, any financing, acquisition or reorganization involving the company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise would require premature disclosure of any other material nonpublic information as to which the company has a bona fide business purpose for maintaining its confidentiality, then for so long as such circumstances or such business purpose continues to exist (provided that the number of days of any such -------- suspension may not exceed an aggregate of 120 days in any calendar year), the company shall not be required to prepare or file any such supplement, amendment or document. (ii) each holder agrees by acquisition of a registrable security that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the existence of any fact or event of the kind described in section 2.1(ii) or 4.2(i) (which --------------- ------ notice need not disclose the fact, event or information), such holder will forthwith discontinue the disposition of any registrable securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement until such holder's receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by section 4.2(i), -------------- or until it is advised in writing by the company that the use of the prospectus related to the shelf registration statement may be resumed, and, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in such prospectus. if so directed by the company, each holder will deliver to the company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such registrable securities that was current at the time of receipt of such notice. (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in the case of a demand registration statement, the filing of a registration statement is postponed as permitted by section 2.1(ii), or, in the case of a shelf registration --------------- statement, the preparation and filing of a supplement, amendment or incorporated document is postponed as permitted by section 4.2(i) or section -------------- 4.2(ii), the five-year period for filing a demand registration statement or the three-year period of effectiveness of the shelf registration statement, as the case may be, shall be extended by the aggregate number of days of such postponement. 4.3. subject to section 4.2(i), prepare and file the commission -------------- such amendments,supplements or incorporated documents to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement. if the registration statement is for an underwritten offering, the company shall amend the registration statement or supplement the prospectus whenever required by the terms of the underwriting agreement entered into pursuant to section 4.6. in the event that any registrable ----------- securities included in a registration statement subject to, or required by, this agreement remain unsold at the end of the period during which the company is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, the company may file a post- effective amendment to the registration statement for the purpose of removing such securities from registered status. 4.4. furnish to each selling holder of registrable securities copies of the registration statement, any pre-effective or post-effective amendment thereto, the prospectus, including each preliminary prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, in each case in conformity with the requirements of the securities act. 4.5. use the company's reasonable best efforts (i) to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under the securities or blue sky laws of such states or jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the underwriters' representative or agent (as applicable, or if inapplicable, the majority selling holders), and (ii) to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of the offer and transfer of any of the registrable securities in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment; provided, however, that the company shall not be required in -------- ------- connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business, subject itself to taxation or to file a general consent to service of process in any states or jurisdictions where it is not now so subject. 4.6. in the event of demand registration statement, enter into and perform the company's obligations under an underwriting or agency agreement (including indemnification and contribution obligations of underwriters or agents), in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter or underwriters of or agents for such offering. the company shall also cooperate with the majority selling holders and the underwriters' representative or agent for such offering in the marketing of the registrable securities, including making reasonably available the company's officers, accountants, counsel, premises, books and records for such purpose. 4.7. promptly notify each selling holder of any stop order issued or threatened to be issued by the commission in connection therewith (and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered). 4.8. make generally available to the company's security holders an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act no later than 90 days following the end of the 12-month period beginning with the first month of the company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of each registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement. 4.9. make reasonably available for inspection by any selling holder, any underwriter participating in such offering and the representatives of such selling holder and underwriter (but not more than one firm of legal counsel to such selling holders), all financial and other information as shall be reasonably requested by them, and provide the selling holder, any underwriter participating in such offering and the representatives of such selling holder and underwriter the opportunity to discuss the business affairs of the company with its principal executives and independent public accountants who have certified the audited financial statements included in such registration statement, in each case to the extent necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility under the securities act; provided, however, that information -------- ------- that the company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which the company advises such person in writing, is confidential shall not be disclosed unless such person signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to the company. 4.10. in the event of a demand registration statement, use the company's reasonable best efforts to obtain a "comfort letter" from its independent public accountants and legal opinions of counsel to the company addressed to the selling holders, in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by such letters and in a form that shall be reasonably satisfactory to the majority selling holders. the company shall furnish to each selling holder a signed counterpart of any such comfort letter or legal opinion. delivery of any comfort letter shall be subject to the recipient furnishing such written representations or acknowledgments as are customarily provided by selling stockholders who receive such comfort letters under sas no. 72. nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to require a selling holder to make representations and warranties if the selling holder is willing to receive a letter in the form to be provided to selling stockholders not making representations and warranties under sas no. 76. 4.11. provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all registrable securities covered by such registration statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of such registration statement. 4.12. use all reasonable efforts to cause the registrable securities covered by such registration statement, if the common stock is then listed on a securities exchange or included for quotation in a recognized trading market, to continue to be so listed or included for a reasonable period of time after the offering. section 5. holders' obligations. -------------------- 5.1. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to this agreement with respect to the registrable securities of any selling holder of registrable securities that such selling holder shall: (i) furnish to the company such information regarding such selling holder and its affiliates, the number of registrable securities owned and proposed to be sold by it, the intended method of disposition of such securities and any other information as shall be required to effect the registration of such selling holder's registrable securities, and cooperate with the company in preparing such registration statement and in complying with the requirements of the securities act; (ii) agree to sell their registrable securities to the underwriters at the same price and on substantially the same terms and conditions as the company or the other persons on whose behalf the registration statement was being filed have agreed to sell their securities, and execute the underwriting agreement agreed to by the company and the majority selling holders and customary custody arrangements, lock-up letters, indemnities, questionnaires and other documents reasonably required by the underwriters or agents and agreed to by the majority selling holders. 5.2. in the event that a demand registration statement or a piggyback registration statement becomes effective, if and to the extent requested by the managing underwriter or lead agent for the offering relating thereto, no holder shall offer, sell or agree to sell or otherwise dispose of or transfer any registrable securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any registrable securities (other than, in the case of the selling holders under the demand registration statement or piggyback registration statement, pursuant to such demand registration statement or piggyback registration statement, as the case may be), or exercise any right to register any such securities, during the period commending ten days prior to the anticipated effective date of such registration statement and ending 120 days from the effective date of such registration statement. in order to enforce the foregoing agreement, the company shall be entitled to impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the registrable securities of each holder until the end of such period. section 6. expenses of registration. expenses in connection with ------------------------ registrations pursuant to this agreement shall be allocated and paid as follows: 6.1. with respect to the shelf registration statement, mko shall bear and pay or shall reimburse the company for, and with respect to each demand registration statement, the company shall bear and pay, all of the expenses incurred in connection with the registration and offering of registrable securities with respect to such shelf registration statement or demand registration statement, as the case may be, including, but not limited to, all registration, filing and national association of securities dealers, inc. fees, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws, all word processing and duplicating expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, the fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, the fees and disbursements of the company's independent public accountants, including the expenses of "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance, and all printing expenses (including the printing of certificates evidencing the registrable securities and the printing of the registration statement and any related prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto) (collectively, the "registration expenses"); provided, -------- however, that, the selling holders shall pay (i) underwriting discounts and - ------- commissions relating to the registrable securities sold by them pursuant to any such registration statement and (ii) all fees and disbursements of counsel and any other advisors to the selling holders. notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the obligations of mko under this section 6.1 ----------- exceed $75,000 in the aggregate. in no event shall mko be responsible for the expenses of a demand registration statement. to the extent mko is not required by this section to pay or reimburse the company for expenses incurred in connection with a shelf registration statement, those expenses shall be borne and paid by the company, except as expressly otherwise provided in the first sentence of this section. 6.2. the company shall bear and pay all registration expenses incurred in connection with any piggyback registration statements pursuant to section 3, other than (i) underwriting discounts and commissions relating --------- to registrable securities, (ii) the portion of any filing fees allocable to the registrable securities included in such registration by the holders and (iii) the fees and disbursements of any counsel and other advisors to the selling holders (each of which expenses in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be paid on a pro rata basis by the selling holders of registrable securities included in such piggyback registration statement and which expenses in clause (iii) shall be paid on a pro rata basis by the selling holders for which the expenses are incurred). section 7. indemnification; contribution. if any registrable ----------------------------- securities are included in a registration statement under this agreement: 7.1. to the extent permitted by applicable law, the company shall indemnify and hold harmless each selling holder, its directors, officers, shareholders, employees, investment advisors, agents and affiliates, either direct or indirect (and each such affiliate's directors, officers, shareholders, employees, investment advisors and agents) and each other person, if any, who controls such selling holder within the meaning of the securities act against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendments or supplements thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (collectively, a "violation"); provided, however, that the indemnification required by this -------- ------- section 7.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, - ----------- claim, damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by the indemnified party expressly for use in connection with such registration. 7.2. to the extent permitted by applicable law, each selling holder shall indemnify and hold harmless the company, its directors, officers, shareholders, employees, investment advisors, agents and affiliates, either direct or indirect (and each such affiliate's directors, officers, shareholders, employees, investment advisors and agents) and each other person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any other selling holder and any controlling person or any such other selling holder against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, to which any of the foregoing persons may otherwise become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such selling holder expressly for use in connection with such registration statement; provided, however, that (x) the indemnification -------- ------- required by this section 7.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement ----------- of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if settlement is effected without the consent of the relevant selling holder of registrable securities, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (y) in no event shall the amount of any indemnity under this section 7.2 and of the ----------- contribution obligation of a selling holder under section 7.4 exceed the net ----------- proceeds from the applicable offering received by such selling holder, and (z) the obligation to provide indemnification hereunder shall be several, and not joint and several, among the indemnifying parties. 7.3. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, - --------- investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may make a claim under this section 7, such indemnified party shall --------- deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time following the commencement of any such action , if and to the extent materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 7 but shall not relieve the indemnifying --------- party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than pursuant to this section 7. any fees and expenses incurred by the --------- indemnified party (including any fees and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or proceeding) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within thirty days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). any such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expenses of such indemnified party unless(i) the indemnifying party shall have failed to promptly assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding or (ii) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by its counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party and that the assertion of such defenses would create a conflict of interest such that counsel employed by the indemnifying party could not represent the indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party; it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action, claim or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, unless the indemnified party shall have been advised by its counsel that a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such action, claim or proceeding such that the counsel could not represent the indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels). no indemnifying party shall be liable to an indemnified party for any settlement of any action, proceeding or claim without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 7.4. if the indemnification required by this section 7 from the --------- indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in this section 7: --------- (i) the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such loses, claims, damages, liabilities or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any violation has been committed by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such violation. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 7.1 and section 7.2, ----------- ----------- any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (ii) the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7.4 were determined ----------- by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in section 7.4(i). -------------- no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 7.5. the obligations of the company and the selling holders of registrable securities under this section 7 shall survive the completion of --------- any offering of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement under this agreement. section 8. transfer of common stock. notwithstanding anything in ------------------------ this agreement to the contrary, no holder may transfer any shares of common stock to any person, except as set forth in the last paragraph of this section 8, unless prior to any such transfer such person has executed an - --------- agreement (in the form of exhibit a hereto) to be bound by the provisions of --------- this agreement. the company shall place the following legend on any certificate representing shares of common stock held by a holder: "this security is subject to certain restrictions on transfer contained in a stockholders agreement dated as of ____, 1996 between mk rail corporation and morrison knudsen corporation to which the holder of this certificate is bound, a copy of which agreement is on file with the secretary of mk rail corporation." in order to enforce the foregoing transfer restriction, without limiting any other rights or remedies available to the company, the company shall be entitled to impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the registrable securities of each holder. the foregoing transfer restrictions and legend shall be removed in connection with any sale of common stock to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to rule 144 or any similar rule promulgated by the commission under the securities act, in each case so long as the specific identities of the transferees are not known to the holders selling such shares prior to such sale. section 9. corporate governance agreement. ------------------------------ 9.1. until either the second anniversary of the distribution date (or, if an effective election request, as defined in section 9.6 hereof, is ----------- made and the stockholders meeting, as defined in section 9.7 hereof, is held prior thereto, the date of the stockholders meeting), each holder (i) shall vote all of its shares of registrable securities and any other voting securities of the company over which such holder exercises voting power (or execute written consents in lieu of meetings) in favor of the election of the company's nominees for director and against the removal of any of the company's directors (other than a removal for cause) at any meeting of stockholders or in any action by written consent and (ii) shall take all other necessary or desirable actions within such holder's control (including, but not limited to, attendance at annual or special stockholder meetings of the company in person or by proxy for purposes of obtaining a quorum) to elect such nominees and to vote against such removal of any of the company's directors; provided, however, that the total number -------- ------- of directors on the company's board of directors shall not be fewer than seven and a majority of such directors shall at all times consist of outside directors. notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder shall not be required to vote any voting securities of the company over which such holder exercises voting power that are not registrable securities (or execute written consents in lieu of meetings with respect to such voting securities) as otherwise required by this section to the extent the voting securities are held or controlled by the holder as an agent, custodian, trustee or executor, in all cases for or on behalf of parties that are not holders of registrable securities or their affiliates or associates (as defined in the rules promulgated under the exchange act), or are controlled by the holder as an investment advisor for an investment company registered under the investment company act of 1940, as amended, or as an investment advisor for any other person or group; provided that in all cases, the arrangement -------- whereby the holder owns or controls the voting securities has not been entered into for the purpose of circumventing this section; and further ------- provided, in the case of securities controlled by the holder as an - -------- investment advisor for a person or group that is not an investment company registered under the investment company act, that no holder or holders has a direct economic beneficial interest in the person or group for which the holder so acts as an investment advisor. 9.2. without the prior written consent of the company, until either (i) ninety (90) days prior to the scheduled date of the stockholders meeting (if an effective election request is made pursuant to section 9.6 hereof) or (ii) the second anniversary of the distribution date (if no effective election request is made) (in either case, the "standstill termination date"), no holder may (i) solicit proxies (as such terms are defined in rule 14a-1 under the exchange act), whether or not such solicitation is exempt under 14a-2 under the exchange act, with respect to any matter from holders of any shares of common or preferred stock of the company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for or exercisable (whether currently or upon the occurrence of any contingency) for the purchase of any such capital stock, or make any communication exempted from the definition of solicitation by rule 14a-1(i)(2)(iv) under the exchange act, or (ii) initiate, or induce or attempt to induce any other person or group (as defined in section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act) to initiate, any stockholder proposal or tender offer for securities of the company or any subsidiary thereof, any change of control of the company or any subsidiary thereof or the convening of a stockholders' meeting of the company or any subsidiary thereof; or (iii) otherwise seek or propose (or request permission to propose) to influence or control the management or policies of the company or any subsidiary thereof. nothing herein shall be deemed to apply to a holder to the extent the holder is acting solely in its capacity as an agent, custodian, trustee or executor holding securities that are not registrable securities for persons that are not holders or affiliates of holders, provided that the holder's actions are (a) at the direction of -------- a person or persons that are not holders that are the beneficial owners of the securities so held by the holder or (b) arise from the fiduciary duties of the holder acting in such capacity ascertained in good faith after consulting with and based on advice of counsel as described in reasonable detail in a written notice given the company at least thirty (30) days prior to taking such action; and further provided that in all cases the arrangement -------------------- whereby the holder holds the securities has not been entered into, and the action by the holder has not been taken, for the purpose of circumventing this section. 9.3. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of sections 9.1 and 9.2 hereof shall terminate at such time prior ------------ --- to the second anniversary of the distribution date, if ever, that all of the registrable securities held by all holders constitutes less than 15% of the outstanding common stock. 9.4. for so long as the provisions of section 9.1 hereof are in ----------- force and effect, the company shall not amend the rights plan (i) to change the percentage used in the definition of "acquiring person" therein so that it is less than fifteen percent (15%) or (ii) in any other manner that would deprive the holders of the registrable securities of the intended benefits of the rights plan amendment. 9.5. at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the company scheduled to occur at least seventy-five (75) days after the effective date of this agreement, the board of directors of the company shall propose to the stockholders of the company, shall recommend approval of, and shall solicit proxies voting to approve an amendment (the "certificate amendment") to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the company, as amended, that, if adopted and approved by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the company, would amend the first sentence of section 3 of the seventh article thereof in its entirety so it states as follows: subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under circumstances specified in a preferred stock designation, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the board resulting from death, resignation, disqualifications, removal or other cause, will be filled solely by the affirmative vote of the majority of the remaining directors, then in office, even though less than a quorum of the board, or by a sole remaining director; provided, however, that at the sole option of the board, effected by resolution of the board of directors, one or more such vacancies or newly created directorships may be filled by the stockholders at a meeting of the stockholders called by the board of directors. if the certificate amendment is effectively adopted and approved by the stockholders of the company, the board of directors shall make a conforming amendment to the first sentence of by-law 11 of the by-laws of the company. 9.6. the holders shall have the right at their option to request that the company hold a meeting of the stockholders as provided herein by delivery of a written request (the "election request") to the secretary of the company at its principal executive offices not more than one hundred twenty (120) nor less than ninety (90) days prior to the second anniversary of the distribution date, which election request shall identify each of the holders making the election request and shall include the information they would be required to give under by-law 13 of the by-laws of the company as in effect on the date hereof as if they were making nominations for positions as directors at an annual meeting or the stockholders of the company. an election request shall be ineffective if it has not been executed by holders owning registrable securities constituting at least fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding common stock of the company as of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the second anniversary of the distribution date and shall cease to be effective if prior to the second anniversary of the distribution date the holders executing the election request cease to own registrable securities constituting at least fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding common stock of the company. if no effective election request is delivered to the secretary of the company at the company's principal executive offices not more than on hundred twenty (120) nor less than ninety (90) days prior to said second anniversary of the distribution date or if, prior to the second anniversary of the distribution date, the election request ceases to be effective, the holders shall have no further rights under this section. 9.7. provided the certificate amendment has been adopted and approved, upon receipt of an effective election request, unless and until it becomes ineffective, the board of directors of the company shall call a meeting of the stockholders of the company to beheld as closely as practicable to the second anniversary of the distribution date (which meeting may be the annual meeting of stockholders) (the "stockholders meeting"), at which meeting the stockholders of the company shall be entitled to vote to fill vacancies and/or newly-created positions on the board of directors of the company, which vacancies and/or newly created positions, when filled, will constitute a majority of the company's board of directors. 9.8. nothing in section 9.6 or 9.7 hereof shall be deemed to ----------- --- amend, modify or waive any provisions of the by-laws of the company, including, without limitation, those regarding the manner in which stockholders of the company may make proposals or nominations at meetings of such stockholders, all of which shall continue to be in full force and effect with respect to the stockholders meeting, if it is held. the provisions of by-law 13 of the company's by-laws shall be in full force and effect with respect to all nominations to fill vacancies at the stockholders meeting, if it is held. section 10. amendment, modification and waivers; further -------------------------------------------- assurances. - ---------- 10.1. this agreement may be amended with the consent of the company, and the company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the company shall have obtained the written consent of holders owning registrable securities possessing a majority in number of the registrable securities than outstanding to such amendment, action or omission to act. 10.2. no waiver of any terms or conditions of this agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other breach of such terms and conditions or any other term or condition, nor shall any failure to enforce any provision hereof operate as a wavier of such provision or of any other provision hereof. no written waiver hereunder, unless it by its own terms explicitly provides to the contrary, shall be construed to effect a continuing waiver of the provisions being waived and no such waiver in any instance shall constitute a waiver in any other instance or for any other purpose or impair the right of the party against whom such waiver is claimed in all other instances or for all other purposes to require full compliance with such provision. 10.3. each of the parties hereto shall execute all such further instruments and documents and take all such further action as any other party hereto may reasonably require in order to effectuate the terms and purposes of this agreement. section 11. assignment; benefit. this agreement and all of the ------------------- provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, permitted assigns, executors, administrators or successors; provided, however, that except as specifically

"bankruptcy code"), mk rail and mko executed and delivered a stockholders agreement (the "agreement") dated as of june 20, 1996; and whereas, the agreement contains certain agreements regarding the registration and voting of restricted shares of common stock of mk rail held by mko which stock it was contemplated would be distributed to certain creditors of mk and mko; and whereas, as a result of negotiations between mk and equity holders of mk, it is contemplated that mk's plan of reorganization will be amended so that it provides for rights or options to be granted to equity holders of mk which will permit them, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to receive a portion of the restricted shares of common stock of mk rail held by mko; and whereas, mk has made a motion (an "1145 motion") requesting that the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction over mk's bankruptcy proceeding issue an order (an "1145 order") providing that the offering, issuance, sale and distribution by mko of the common stock of mk rail qualifies for the exemption (the "1145 exemption"), available under section 1145(a) of the bankruptcy code, from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933, as amended; and whereas, the securities and exchange commission has stated that it will not object to the 1145 motion; and whereas, the parties wish to amend the agreement as set forth herein to

last sentence of this paragraph, and all common stock so distributed shall after such distribution be subject to said transfer restrictions and legend requirements as well as all other terms and conditions hereof. the foregoing transfer restrictions and legend shall be removed in connection with any sale of common stock to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant
