(any portion of the dollar amount of such damages that is not being disputed by the seller's representative shall be referred to in this agreement as the "undisputed amount," and the remaining portion of such damages shall be referred to in this agreement as the "disputed amount.") if no response notice is delivered within sixty (60) days after the delivery of a claim notice to the seller's representative and the escrow agent, then the seller's representative shall be deemed not to be disputing the damages described in the claim notice, and in such event the term "undisputed amount" shall be deemed to refer to the entire dollar amount of the damages set forth in the claim notice (and, accordingly, in such event the "disputed amount" of the indemnification claim described in such claim notice shall be zero). (c) if the seller's representative is disputing or is deemed to be disputing all or any portion of the dollar amount of the damages set forth in a claim notice, then no distribution of any portion of the escrow fund shall be made by the escrow agent to the purchaser with respect to the disputed amount until either (i) a settlement agreement executed by the purchaser and the seller's representative containing a settlement of the indemnification claim described in such claim notice (and specifying the respective amounts of cash (if any) and escrow shares (if any) to be distributed to the purchaser from the escrow) shall have been delivered to the escrow agent, or (ii) a final arbitration award (made pursuant to the arbitration procedures set forth in section 4(d) hereof) containing a final binding resolution of the indemnification claim described in such claim notice (and specifying the amount of the damages (if any) with respect to which the purchaser is entitled to indemnification) (an "arbitration award") shall have been delivered to the escrow agent. (d) if (i) the seller's representative is disputing or deemed to be disputing all or any portion of the dollar amount of the damages set forth in a claim notice, and (ii) within ninety (90) days after the delivery of such claim notice by the purchaser to the seller's representative and the escrow agent in accordance with section 5.7 of the purchase agreement and section 4(a) hereof, the escrow agent has not received a settlement agreement satisfying the requirements of clause "(i)" of section 4(c) hereof, then the indemnification claim or claims described in such claim notice shall be referred to an arbitrator chosen jointly by the seller's representative and the purchaser. if the seller's representative and the purchaser do not agree on the selection of an arbitrator within ten (10) days after the expiration of the ninety (90) day period referred to in this section 4(d), the purchaser or the seller's representative may submit the matter in dispute for resolution pursuant to a binding arbitration proceeding under the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce. the venue for such arbitration proceeding shall be in london, england. the arbitrator's fees and other related expenses of any arbitration under this agreement (such as expenses for transcripts of the arbitration proceedings) shall be borne by the seller and the purchaser in such proportions as shall be determined by the arbitrator, or if there is no such determination, then such fees and other expenses shall be borne equally by the seller and the purchaser; provided, however, that 4 subject to section 4(e) hereof, any such fees and other expenses that are required to be borne by the seller (the "seller's arbitration expenses") shall be paid (without deductions or set-offs of any nature) out of the escrow fund (assuming there are sufficient escrow shares and/or cash remaining in the escrow fund after satisfaction of any arbitration award) upon receipt by the escrow agent of written instructions executed by the seller's representative directing the escrow agent to pay such seller's arbitration expenses. "seller's arbitration expenses" shall not be deemed to include any costs or expenses that constitute "defense costs" for purposes of section 8(c) hereof. the arbitrator shall have the authority to make an award specifying the dollar amount (if any) representing the portion of the disputed amount that is to be distributed by the escrow agent to the purchaser from the escrow fund, but shall have no right to grant special, punitive or exemplary damages or indirect or consequential damages or to grant any form of equitable relief. the determination of the arbitrator as to the dollar amount (if any) representing the portion of the disputed amount that is payable out of the escrow fund shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof. the determination of the combination of cash and escrow shares to be distributed to the purchaser to satisfy any arbitration award shall be made by the seller's representative (in accordance with section 5(b) hereof), and not by the arbitrator. (e) if (i) the escrow agent has made distributions from the escrow fund to the seller's representative in respect of seller's arbitration expenses or seller's representative expenses (as defined below) in accordance with sections 4(d) and 8(b) hereof, and (ii) the actual indemnifiable damages required to be paid under this agreement to the purchaser from the escrow fund shall exceed the amount available in the escrow fund, then the seller shall pay directly to the purchaser in cash (following the complete exhaustion of the escrow fund) an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount by which the actual indemnifiable damages required to be paid under this agreement to the purchaser from the escrow fund actually exceeds the amount available in the escrow fund; or (b) the sum of the amount of any seller's arbitration expenses and seller's representative expenses previously paid by the escrow agent to the seller's representative from the escrow fund in accordance with sections 4(d) and 8(b) hereof. the amount of any payment required to be made to the purchaser pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payment(s) previously made pursuant to this section 4(e). 5. distribution of escrow fund.

(b) with respect to every distribution out of the escrow fund (including every distribution pursuant to sections 5(a) and 6 hereof and every distribution in respect of seller's arbitration expenses, seller's representative expenses and defense costs), the seller's representative shall have the exclusive right to determine whether such distribution shall be in the form of escrow shares or cash, or any combination thereof; and, as soon as reasonably practicable after the seller's representative shall have determined the form of such distribution, the seller's representative shall notify the escrow agent of such determination. (c) to the extent that any escrow shares are required to be distributed to the purchaser pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the escrow agent shall effect the distribution of such escrow shares to the purchaser by surrendering the certificate representing such escrow shares to the purchaser's transfer agent for cancellation upon receipt by the escrow agent from the purchaser's transfer agent of a copy of a letter from the purchaser to the purchaser's transfer agent instructing such transfer agent to issue a new certificate to the escrow agent for the number of escrow shares remaining after giving effect to the distribution of those escrow shares required to be distributed to the purchaser. to the extent that any escrow shares are required to be distributed to the seller's representative (or to any person designated by the seller's representative) pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the escrow agent shall effect the distribution of such escrow shares by surrendering the certificate representing the escrow shares to the purchaser's transfer agent and instructing such transfer agent to issue and deliver to the seller's representative (or to such other person or persons as the seller's representative may designate in writing) a new certificate or new certificates representing the number of escrow shares that are required to be distributed to the seller's representative (or to any person designated by the seller's representative) and to reissue in the name of the escrow agent, and to deliver to the escrow agent, a certificate representing any escrow shares required to be retained in escrow after giving effect to such distribution. the value per share of the escrow shares for purposes of this agreement shall be the average of the closing prices of purchaser common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market for the ninety (90) trading days immediately following the closing date (adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction). the escrow agent may rely conclusively on the per share value calculated as set forth herein for the purpose of determining the number of escrow shares required to be distributed from the escrow hereunder. all distributions made out of the escrow shares shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. except 6 as provided in section 2 hereof, no party hereto shall have any right to substitute other property for the escrow fund or to change the per share value stated herein. (d) to the extent that any cash is required to be distributed to the purchaser or the seller's representative (or to any person designated by the seller's representative) pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the escrow agent shall effect such distribution by delivering such cash directly to the purchaser or to the seller's representative (or to such other person or persons as the seller's representative may designate in writing), as the case may be. 6. termination. this agreement shall terminate on the expiration date; provided, however, that (i) if, on the expiration date, there are any outstanding unresolved indemnification claims as to which the escrow agent has received claim notices pursuant to section 5.7 of the purchase agreement and section 4 hereof on or prior to the expiration date ("unresolved claims"), then this agreement shall continue in effect until the resolution of all such unresolved claims; and (ii) any obligation of the seller (or the parent shareholders after the liquidation of the seller as provided in section 14 hereof) pursuant to section 4(e) hereof shall survive such termination. on the expiration date (or as soon thereafter as is practicable), the escrow agent shall distribute to the seller's representative (in accordance with section 5(b) hereof) all of the cash and escrow shares comprising the escrow fund; provided, however, that a portion of the escrow fund equal in value to the total dollar amount of the disputed amounts of all unresolved claims shall remain in escrow. at such time, and from time to time, after the expiration date as the escrow agent shall receive a settlement agreement executed by the purchaser and the seller's representative containing a settlement of an unresolved claim or an arbitration award containing a resolution of an unresolved claim, the escrow agent shall distribute to the purchaser (in accordance with section 5(b) hereof) a portion of the escrow fund equal in value to the dollar amount identified in the settlement agreement or arbitration award as being payable to the purchaser out of the escrow fund in respect of such unresolved claim. all of the cash and escrow shares remaining in the escrow fund after resolution of all unresolved claims shall be promptly distributed to the seller's representative (without the need for any consent or approval on the part of the purchaser). 7. the escrow agent.

(a) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, all restrictions set forth in section 3 hereof (that have not previously terminated) shall terminate and cease to be of any further force or effect upon the restriction expiration date; provided, however, that the rights granted to the potential sellers and the other holders under this agreement (including the registration rights granted under section 4 hereof) shall survive any such termination and continue in full force and effect. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights granted by the purchaser pursuant to section 4 hereof shall survive any merger involving, and any other change in control of, the purchaser. (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement: (i) upon the occurrence of a special termination event with respect to an individual parent shareholder, all restrictions set forth in section 3 hereof (that have not previously terminated) shall cease to apply to such individual parent shareholder and shall cease to apply to any permitted transferee to whom such individual parent shareholder has transferred any transaction shares; (ii) any shares of purchaser common stock sold by such individual parent shareholder or any such permitted transferee after the occurrence of a special termination event shall not be taken into account in determining the number of restricted shares sold pursuant to section 3.1(a), 3.1(b), 3.1(c), 3.1(d) or 3.2 hereof; and (iii) for each restricted period after the restricted period in which a special termination event occurs with respect to an individual parent shareholder, the aggregate maximum number of restricted shares that can be sold by the remaining parent shareholders pursuant to the applicable provision of section 3.1 shall be reduced by the number of shares equal to such individual parent shareholder's percentage share of the previously applicable aggregate maximum number of restricted shares that could be sold under said provision of section 3.1. (thus, for example, if a special termination event occurs with respect to yossi tulpan (whose percentage share is 31.407%) in the third restricted period, then the maximum number of restricted shares that could be sold pursuant to section 3.1(d) hereof by the other parent shareholders would be equal to 68.593% of the amount by which 2,376,000 exceeds the number of restricted shares that were sold by the potential sellers pursuant to sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) hereof.) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the rights granted to the individual parent shareholders and their permitted transferees under this agreement (including the registration rights granted under section 4 hereof) shall survive any such termination and continue in full force and effect. 3.5 hedging transactions. nothing contained in this agreement will operate to limit the ability of any potential seller to lend any restricted shares in connection with, or otherwise engage in, conventional "collar"-type or other "hedging" transactions at any time after the closing; provided, however, that (i) the potential sellers shall not be permitted to engage in any "hedging" transactions with respect to their restricted shares during the 40-day period commencing as of the closing date if such transactions would jeopardize the availability of the 8 regulation s exemption for the issuance of the purchaser common stock being issued to the seller at the closing; and (ii) nothing contained in this section 3.5 shall be deemed to allow a potential seller to sell or otherwise transfer all of such potential seller's beneficial interest in his restricted shares if such transfer would violate section 3.1 hereof. 4. registration. 4.1 shelf/demand registration. (a) if the purchaser shall not have delivered to the potential sellers, on or prior to september 18, 1997, the written opinion referred to in the last sentence of section 2 hereof, the purchaser shall promptly (and in any event prior to september 22, 1997) file with the commission a registration statement on form s-3 (a "shelf registration statement") providing for the sale of 468,000 registrable shares, and the purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to cause such shelf registration statement to become effective no later than the date 40 days after the closing date and to remain continuously effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the potential sellers may sell all such registrable shares publicly in the united states (and otherwise) without any restriction or limitation of any nature, or (ii) the date on which the distribution described in the shelf registration statement is complete. (b) any holder may request at any time during the sixty day period immediately preceding the first day of the third restricted period that the purchaser register under the securities act all or any part of the registrable shares that may be sold during the third restricted period. if the purchaser receives such a request, then, subject to sections 4.1(d) and 4.8 hereof, the purchaser shall (i) within 10 days after its receipt of such request, give written notice thereof to all other holders, and (ii) as soon as practicable after its receipt of such request (but in any event within 30 days after its receipt of such request), effect a registration under the securities act of all registrable shares that (a) the holders request to be registered, and (b) may be sold during such third restricted period in accordance with sections 3.1(b) and 3.1(c) hereof. the purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to cause such registration to remain continuously effective until the earliest of (a) the day immediately preceding the second anniversary of the closing date, (b) the date 30 days after delivery to all holders of a legal opinion or "no-action" letter and other documentation satisfying the requirements of section 4.8 hereof, or (c) the date on which the distribution covered by such registration is complete. (c) any holder may request at any time during the sixty day period immediately preceding the first day of the fourth restricted period that the purchaser register under the securities act all or any part of the registrable shares that may be sold during the fourth restricted period. if the purchaser receives such a request, then, subject to sections 4.1(d) and 4.8 hereof, the purchaser shall (i) within 10 days after its receipt of such request, give written notice thereof to all other holders, and (ii) as soon as practicable after its receipt of such request (but in any event within 30 days after its receipt of such request), effect a registration under the securities act of all registrable shares that (a) the holders request to be registered, 9 and (b) may be sold during such fourth restricted period in accordance with section 3.1(d) hereof. the purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to cause such registration to remain continuously effective until the earlier of (a) the date 30 days after delivery to all holders of a legal opinion or "no action" letter and other documentation satisfying the requirements of section 4.8 hereof, or (b) the date on which the distribution covered by such registration is complete. (d) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 4.1 hereof, the purchaser shall have no obligation to effect any registration pursuant to section 4.1(b) or 4.1(c) unless the aggregate number of registrable shares requested to be registered shall be equal to or greater than 100,000. 4.2 purchaser registration. (a) notice of registration. if at any time or from time to time the purchaser shall determine to effect a registration with the commission of any securities for its own account (other than on form s-4 or form s-8) or for the account of any other person, the purchaser will: (i) promptly (and in any event at least 45 days prior to the filing of a registration statement under the securities act with respect to such securities) give to all holders written notice thereof; and (ii) include in such registration (and any related registration or qualification under blue sky laws), and in the related underwriting (if any) all registrable shares that the holders request to have included in such registration (such request to be in writing and to be made within 30 days after receipt by all holders of such written notice from the purchaser). (b) underwriting. if the registration of which the purchaser gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the purchaser shall so advise the holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to section 4.2(a)(i) hereof. in such event the right of any holder to have registrable shares included in the registration pursuant to this section 4.2 shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting. all holders proposing to distribute any registrable shares through such underwriting shall (together with the purchaser and the other shareholders of the purchaser distributing their shares of purchaser common stock through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting by the purchaser. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 4.2, if such managing underwriter reasonably determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares of purchaser common stock to be included in such registration and underwriting, the managing underwriter may exclude or otherwise limit the number of shares of purchaser common stock to be included in such registration and underwriting by shareholders of the purchaser, including, 10 without limitation, the holders, prior to the exclusion of any shares to be sold pursuant to such registration and underwriting by the purchaser. the number of registrable shares that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated among all the participating holders and other shareholders of the purchaser participating in such registration and underwriting in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective numbers of registrable shares held by such holders (and requested to be included in such registration) and the number of shares of purchaser common stock held by such other shareholders (and requested to be included in such registration) at the time of filing the registration statement. to facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above provisions, the purchaser may round the number of shares allocated to any holder or shareholder to the nearest 100 shares. if any holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the purchaser and the managing underwriter. any securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration.

(iii) use its reasonable efforts to (a) register and qualify (or obtain appropriate exemptions for) the shares covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such states and other jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the holders, and (b) keep such registrations and qualifications in effect for so long as each registration statement remains in effect; provided, however, that the purchaser shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to (1) qualify to do business in any such jurisdiction, (2) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (3) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction; (iv) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement (in usual and customary form) with the managing underwriters of such offering;

(ix) advise each holder participating in such registration, promptly after the purchaser shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the commission suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use its reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal (at the earliest practicable date) if such stop order should be issued; and (x) prior to the effectiveness of such registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto and at each closing of an underwritten offering, (a) make such reasonable representations and warranties to the holders participating in such registration, and the underwriters, if any, with respect to the registrable shares and the registration statement as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters and selling shareholders in underwritten offerings, (b) obtain opinions of counsel to the purchaser and updates thereof (which counsel and which opinions shall be reasonably satisfactory to the underwriters, if any, and to holders who hold a majority of the registrable shares being sold pursuant to such registration) addressed to each selling holder and the underwriters, if any, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in public offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by such holders and underwriters or their counsel, (c) obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the purchaser's independent certified public accountants addressed to the selling holders and the underwriters, if any, such letters to be in customary form and to cover matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters given to underwriters and selling shareholders in connection with secondary underwritten offerings, and (d) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the holders of a majority of the registrable shares being sold pursuant to such registration and by the underwriters, if any, to evidence compliance with clause (a) of this clause "(x)" and with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the purchaser. 13 4.5 indemnification. (a) the purchaser will indemnify each holder who holds any registrable shares that are included in a registration or qualification pursuant to this agreement and each person controlling or controlled by such holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act against any expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on (i) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, used in connection with such registration or qualification, or (ii) any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) any violation by the purchaser of the securities act, the exchange act, any state or other securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under such acts or laws applicable to the purchaser in connection with any such registration or qualification. in addition, the purchaser will reimburse each such holder, and each person so controlling or controlled by such holder, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any such claim, liability or action; provided, however, that the purchaser will not be liable to any such holder in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, damage or liability arises out of or is based on any untrue statement of a material fact made by the purchaser in the applicable registration statement in reliance upon and in conformity with inaccurate information furnished in writing to the purchaser by any holder or person controlling such holder expressly for use in the applicable registration statement. (b) each holder will, if registrable shares held by such holder are included in the shares as to which a registration or qualification is being effected pursuant to this agreement, indemnify the purchaser and each person controlling or controlled by the purchaser within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act against any expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, used in connection with such registration or qualification, and will reimburse the purchaser, and each person so controlling or controlled by the purchaser, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any such claim, liability or action based on such untrue statement of a material fact, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement of a material fact is made in reliance upon and in conformity with inaccurate information furnished in writing to the purchaser by such holder or person controlling such holder expressly for use in the applicable registration statement. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 4.5(b) or elsewhere in this agreement, any obligation of any holder to indemnify or reimburse any person pursuant to this section shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to the net amount of 14 proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable shares pursuant to the registration or qualification in connection with which indemnification or reimbursement has been sought. (c) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 4.5 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 4.5 unless the failure to give such notice materially prejudices the rights or defenses of the indemnifying party, in which case the indemnifying party shall be relieved of its obligations under this section 4.5 to the extent of such prejudice. in the event of the assertion or commencement of any claim or litigation for which indemnification may be sought, the indemnifying party shall have the right to assume the defense of any such claim or litigation with counsel approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of any matters as to which representation of both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the same counsel would be inappropriate (as reasonably determined by the indemnified party based on the written advice of counsel) due to actual or potential differing interests between them, but shall instead in such event pay the reasonable fees and costs of separate counsel for the indemnified party. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 4.5 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relevant benefits received by the indemnifying party but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements, omissions or violations that resulted in such expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission;
