(e) not applicable. page 7 of 16 directors and executive officers of the reporting persons - --------------------------------------------------------- to the knowledge of the reporting persons, the following directors and executive officers of the reporting persons beneficially own shares of class a common stock as follows: - ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- name number of shares of class a common stock beneficially owned - ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- stanley m. beck, q.c. 3,525.67 - ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- newton g. z. glassman 585(1) - ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- - ------------------------- (1) these 585 shares of class a common stock are beneficially owned by catalyst fund general partner i inc., a private equity fund managed by catalyst capital group inc., in respect of which mr. glassman is the managing partner. page 8 of 16 item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. the issuer's restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that holders of shares of class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share and holders of shares of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share. the holders of shares of class a common stock and shares of class b common stock vote together as a single class on all matters on which stockholders may vote, except when class voting is required by applicable law or on a vote to issue or increase the authorized number of shares of class b common stock. dividends must be paid on both the shares of class a common stock and the shares of class b common stock at any time dividends are paid on either. each share of class b common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of class a common stock and is transferable by the reporting persons to a subsidiary or an affiliate. in addition, each share of class b common stock is automatically converted into a share of class a common stock at the time it is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the reporting persons or a subsequent permitted transferee to any third party (other than a subsidiary or an affiliate of the reporting persons or such subsequent permitted transferee) unless such purchaser or transferee offers to purchase all the shares of class a common stock from the holders thereof for an amount per share equal to the amount per share received by the holder of shares of class b common stock (a "permitted transaction"). notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, any holder of shares of class b common stock may pledge such holder's shares of class b common stock to a pledgee pursuant to a bona fide pledge of such shares as collateral security for indebtedness due to the pledgee, provided that such shares shall not be transferred to or registered in the name of the pledgee and shall remain subject to the transfer restrictions described in the foregoing paragraph. in the event that shares of class b common stock are so pledged, the pledged shares shall not be converted automatically into shares of class a common stock. however, if any such pledged shares become subject to any foreclosure, realization or other similar action of the pledgee, they shall be converted automatically into shares of class a common stock unless they are sold in a permitted transaction. hollinger's articles of amalgamation dated september 17, 1985, as amended, provide that the holders of retractable common shares of hollinger (the "retractable common shares") may cause hollinger to exchange such shares at any time upon demand, subject to certain exceptions, for a number of shares of class a common stock held both directly and indirectly by hollinger determined pursuant to a formula or cash, at hollinger's option. the price for such shares (the "retraction price") is an amount determined by the board of directors of hollinger (or committee thereof) on a quarterly basis within a range of not less than 90% and not more than 100% of the current value (as defined below) on the relevant date divided by the number of retractable common shares outstanding on such date. for these purposes, "current value" is defined by reference to the fair market value of all of the assets of hollinger, less amounts payable upon liquidation to holders of hollinger's preference shares and certain tax liabilities, all as determined by the board of directors of hollinger. hollinger has previously stated that employing this range will allow fluctuating market conditions to be taken into account in setting the retraction price. upon receipt of a retraction notice, hollinger will retract the appropriate number of page 9 of 16 retractable common shares by sending to the holder a stock certificate representing that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the applicable retraction price divided by the current class a market price (as defined below) on the retraction date. for these purposes, the "current class a market price" will be determined primarily by reference to the per share closing price of the class a common stock on the new york stock exchange, with such price being converted into the canadian dollar equivalent. if hollinger elects to satisfy the retraction price in cash, it may do so for all or any part of the shares to be retracted. hollinger is obligated to satisfy certain conditions with respect to shares of class a common stock delivered as a redemption of retractable common shares, including the effectiveness of a registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended, with respect to such shares or the availability of an exemption from such registration, and the listing of such shares on each stock exchange on which shares of class a common stock is listed. the series ii preference shares of hollinger (the "series ii preference shares") are "mirror shares", each of which tracks a number of shares of class a common stock of the issuer equal to the "exchange number". the exchange number is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, and is currently equal to 0.46. each series ii preference share entitles the holder to a dividend in an amount equal to the canadian dollar equivalent of the amount of any dividend on the exchange number of shares of class a common stock of the issuer less any u.s. withholding tax thereon payable by hollinger or any of its subsidiaries. a holder of series ii preference shares is entitled to require hollinger to exchange such holder's series ii preference shares for a number of shares of class a common stock for each such series ii preference share equal to (i) the exchange number plus (ii) the quotient obtained when the amount of declared and unpaid dividends on the series ii preference shares and declared dividends on shares of class a common stock for which dividends have not been declared on the series ii preference shares is divided by the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of the exchange number of shares of class a common stock. on receipt of a retraction notice in respect of series ii preference shares, hollinger is entitled to retract all or part of such series ii preference shares for a cash payment equal to the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of the exchange number of shares of class a common stock plus the amount of the declared and unpaid dividends on the series ii preference shares and declared dividends on shares of class a common stock for which dividends have not been declared on the series ii preference shares. in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of hollinger, the holders of series ii preference shares are entitled to (i) the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of shares of class a common stock (payable in shares of class a common stock or cash, at the option of hollinger) plus (ii) the amount of declared and unpaid dividends on the series ii preference shares and declared dividends on shares of class a common stock for which dividends have not been declared on the series ii preference shares. hollinger is currently prevented from honoring retractions of the retractable common shares and the series ii preference shares as a consequence of it being in default under the terms of the indentures (as defined below). as of november 30, 2006, there were retraction notices from holders of 153,846 retractable common shares at a retraction price of $9.00 per share and 211 retractable common shares at a retraction price of $7.25 per share, which hollinger is unable to complete at the present time. on june 11, 2004, hollinger caused certain shares (the "escrowed shares") of class a common stock to be deposited into escrow with computershare trust company of canada (the "share escrow agent"). the shares of class a common page 10 of 16 stock reported in item 5 of this statement comprise escrowed shares and will be released by the share escrow agent from time to time in order to satisfy retraction requests from the holders of all of the issued and outstanding series ii preference shares. pursuant to the security agreement (the "security agreement"), dated as of march 10, 2003, as amended on september 30, 2004 (the "security agreement amendment"), among hollinger, rmi (as defined below), canada co and wachovia trust company, national association ("wachovia"), the reporting persons granted to wachovia a first priority lien on the shares of class b common stock reported in item 5 of this statement. the security agreement was executed pursuant to the indenture, dated as of march 10, 2003, as supplemented on september 30, 2004, among hollinger, rmi, canada co, ravelston, sugra limited and wachovia (the "first indenture"). pursuant to the second priority notes security agreement (the "second priority notes security agreement"), dated as of september 30, 2004, among hollinger, rmi, canada co and hsbc bank usa, national association ("hsbc"), the reporting persons granted to hsbc a second priority security interest on the shares of class b common stock reported in item 5 of this statement. the second priority notes security agreement was executed pursuant to the indenture, dated as of september 30, 2004, among hollinger, rmi, canada co, ravelston, sugra limited and hsbc (together with the first indenture, the "indentures"). on january 16, 2004, the issuer consented (the "consent") to the entry of a partial final judgment and order of permanent injunction against the issuer in an action brought by the commission in the u.s. district court for the northern district of illinois (the "order"). the consent and order provide, among other things, for the appointment of richard c. breeden ("breeden") as special monitor of the issuer in each of the following events (i) the nomination or election to the board of directors of any individual without the support of at least 80% of incumbent members of the board of directors of the issuer, (ii) the removal of any of the directors of the issuer prior to the end of their term, (iii) the removal of any members of the special committee of the issuer as a member of the board of directors of the issuer and (iv) the removal by the board of directors of the issuer of any of the members of the special committee as a member of the special committee. the special monitor's mandate, among other matters, is to protect the interests of the company's non-controlling stockholders to the extent permitted by law. on january 24, 2006, at the issuer's 2005 annual meeting of stockholders, hollinger nominated two of its directors to serve as directors of the company. as a result of hollinger's 70.1% voting interest, the two nominees were elected to the issuer's board of directors. since these nominees were not endorsed in accordance with the order, breeden became special monitor of the company. these nominees resigned from the issuer's board of directors on july 13, 2006. hollinger has determined to no longer file jointly with the other joint filers as a result of the following: (a)

of each grantor, the payment of all obligations of such grantor now or hereafter existing under the second priority note documents, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, reimbursement obligations, interest, fees, premiums, penalties, indemnifications, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (all such obligations being the "secured obligations"). without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this agreement secures, as to each grantor, the payment of all amounts that constitute part of the secured obligations and would be owed by such grantor, whether incurred alone or with another or others and whether as principal, guarantor or surety, to any second priority secured party under the second priority note documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving a grantor. section 3. grantors remain liable. anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) each grantor shall remain liable under the contracts and agreements included in such grantor's collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this agreement had not been executed, (b) the exercise by the second priority notes collateral agent or any other second priority secured party of any of the rights hereunder shall not release any grantor from any of its duties or obligations under the contracts and agreements included in the collateral and (c) neither the second priority notes collateral agent nor any other second priority secured party shall have any obligation or liability under the contracts and agreements included in the collateral by reason of this agreement or any other second priority note documents, nor shall the second priority notes collateral agent or any other second priority secured party be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of any grantor thereunder 3 or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder. furthermore, the second priority notes collateral agent shall not be liable or accountable for any failure to seize, collect, realize, dispose of, enforce or otherwise deal with the collateral, shall not be bound to institute proceedings for any such purposes or for the purpose of preserving any rights of the second priority notes collateral agent, the grantor or any other person, firm or corporation in respect of the collateral and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or damage whatsoever which may arise in respect of any such failure including, without limitation, resulting from the negligence of the second priority notes collateral agent or any of its

(b) anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the second priority notes collateral agent may from time to time, when the second priority notes collateral agent deems it to be necessary, appoint one or more agents (each a "subagent") for the second priority notes collateral agent hereunder with respect to all or any part of the collateral. in the event that the second priority notes collateral agent so appoints any subagent with respect to any collateral, (i) the assignment and pledge of such collateral and the second priority security interest granted in such collateral by each grantor hereunder shall be deemed for purposes of this second priority notes security agreement to have been made to such subagent, in addition to the second priority notes collateral agent, for the ratable benefit of the second priority notes collateral agent and the other second priority secured parties, as security for the secured obligations of such grantor, (ii) such subagent shall automatically 17 be vested, in addition to the second priority notes collateral agent, with all rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the second priority notes collateral agent hereunder with respect to such collateral, and (iii) the term "second priority notes collateral agent," when used herein in relation to any rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the second priority notes collateral agent with respect to such collateral, shall include such subagent; provided, however, that no such subagent shall be authorized to take any action with respect to any such collateral unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by the second priority notes collateral agent. section 17. remedies. if any event of default shall have occurred and be continuing: (a) the second priority notes collateral agent may exercise in respect of the transferred collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the ucc, ppsa(on) or ppsa(nb), as applicable (whether or not the ucc, ppsa(on) or ppsa(nb), as applicable, apply to the affected transferred collateral), and also may: (i) require each grantor to, and each grantor hereby agrees that it will at its expense and upon request of the second priority notes collateral agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the transferred collateral as directed by the second priority notes collateral agent (to the extent such transferred collateral was not delivered to the second priority notes collateral agent by the first priority notes collateral agent in connection with a collateral transfer) and make it available to the second priority notes collateral agent at a place and time to be designated by the second priority notes collateral agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties; (ii) without notice except as specified below, sell the transferred collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the second priority notes collateral agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the second priority notes collateral agent may deem commercially reasonable; (iii) occupy any premises owned or leased by any of the grantors where the transferred collateral or any part thereof is assembled or located for a reasonable period in order to effectuate its rights and remedies hereunder or under law, without obligation to such grantor in respect of such occupation; and (iv) exercise any and all rights and remedies of any of the grantors under or in connection with the transferred collateral, or otherwise in respect of the transferred collateral, including, without limitation, (a) any and all rights of such grantor to demand or otherwise require payment of any amount under, or performance of any provision of, the support agreement, the receivables and the other collateral, (b) withdraw, or cause or direct the withdrawal, of all funds with respect to the account collateral and (c) exercise all other rights and remedies with respect to the support agreement, the receivables and the other collateral, including, without limitation, those set forth in section 9-607 of the ucc and those set forth in the ppsa(on) and 18 ppsa(nb). each grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days' notice to such grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. the second priority notes collateral agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of transferred collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. the second priority notes collateral agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. no person dealing with the second priority notes collateral agent or its servants or agents shall be concerned to inquire whether the security hereby constituted has become enforceable, whether the powers which the second priority notes collateral agent is purporting to exercise have become exercisable, whether any money remains due on the security of the collateral, as to the necessity or expedience of the stipulations and conditions subject to which any sale, lease or disposition shall be made, otherwise as to the propriety or regularity of any sate or any other dealing by the second priority notes collateral agent with the collateral or to see to the application of any money paid to the second priority notes collateral agent. in the absence of fraud on the part of such persons, such dealings shall be deemed, so far as regards the safety and protection of such person, to be within the powers hereby conferred and to be valid and effective accordingly. (b) all cash proceeds received by or on behalf of the second priority notes collateral agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the transferred collateral may be held by the second priority notes collateral agent as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied (after payment of any amounts payable to the second priority notes collateral agent pursuant to section 18) in whole or in part by the second priority notes collateral agent for the ratable benefit of the second priority secured parties against, all or any part of the secured obligations, in the following manner: (i) first, paid to the second priority notes collateral agent for any amounts then owing to the second priority notes collateral agent under the second priority note documents; and (ii) second, ratably paid to the holders and any other second priority secured parties, for any amounts then owing to them, in their capacities as such, under the second priority note documents ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then owing to such second priority secured parties. any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by or on the behalf of the second priority notes collateral agent and remaining after payment in full of all the secured obligations shall be paid over to the applicable grantor or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. 19 (c) from and after any collateral transfer, all payments received by any grantor under or in connection with the support agreement or otherwise in respect of the transferred collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of the second priority notes collateral agent, shall be segregated from other funds of such grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to the second priority notes collateral agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement). (d) from and after any collateral transfer, the second priority notes collateral agent may, without notice to any grantor except as required by law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and otherwise apply all or any part of the secured obligations against any funds held with respect to the account collateral included in the transferred collateral or in any other deposit account. (e) from and after a collateral transfer, if the second priority notes collateral agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any of the security collateral included in the transferred collateral of any grantor pursuant to this section 17, each grantor agrees that, upon request of the second priority notes collateral agent, such grantor will, at its own expense, to the extent the company then has the present ability to complete and have declared effect a registration statement under the united states securities laws: (i) execute and deliver, and cause each issuer of such security collateral contemplated to be sold and the directors and officers thereof to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or advisable to register for resale such security collateral under the provisions of the securities act of 1933 (as amended from time to time, the "securities act"), to cause the registration statement relating thereto (the "collateral shelf registration statement") to become effective and to remain effective for such period as prospectuses are required by law to be furnished and in any event for so long as is necessary to enable the holders to dispose of the security collateral in the manner of sale provided for in the registration statement and to make all amendments and supplements thereto and to the related prospectus that are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the securities act and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission applicable thereto; (ii) use its best efforts to qualify the security collateral under the state securities or "blue sky" laws and to obtain all necessary governmental approvals for the sale of such security collateral, as requested by the second priority notes collateral agent or any other second priority secured party; 20 (iii) cause each such issuer of such security collateral to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement that will satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act; (iv) provide the second priority notes collateral agent and each other second priority secured party with such other information and projections as may be necessary or advisable to enable the second priority second priority notes collateral agent or any other second priority secured party to effect the sale of such security collateral; (v) take such other actions in furtherance of the resale of the security collateral pursuant to the collateral shelf registration statement as are comparable to those described in section 5 (registration procedures) of the registration rights agreement with respect to the shelf registration statement (as defined therein) mutatis mutandis; and (vi) do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may be necessary to make such sale of such security collateral or any part thereof valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law. (f) the second priority notes collateral agent is authorized, in connection with any sale of the security collateral pursuant to this section 17, to deliver or otherwise disclose to any prospective purchaser of the security collateral: (i) any registration statement or prospectus, and all supplements and amendments thereto, prepared pursuant to subsection (e)(i) above; (ii) any information and projections provided to it pursuant to subsection (e)(iv) above; and (iii) any other information in its possession relating to such security collateral. (g) each grantor acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount of damages that would be suffered by the second priority secured parties by reason of the failure by such grantor to perform any of the covenants contained in subsection (e) above and, consequently, agrees that, if such grantor shall fail to perform any of such covenants, it will pay, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the value of the security collateral on the date the second priority collateral agent shall demand compliance with subsection (e) above. (h) the second priority notes collateral agent may, in addition to any other rights it may have, appoint by instrument in writing a receiver or receiver and manager (both of which are herein called a "receiver") of all or any part of any transferred collateral or may institute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of such a receiver. any such receiver is hereby given, and shall have the same powers and rights and exclusions and limitations of liability as the second priority notes collateral agent 21 has under this agreement, at law or in equity. in exercising any such powers, any such receiver shall, to the extent permitted by law, act as and for all purposes shall be deemed to be the agent of the grantor and the second priority notes collateral agent shall not be responsible for any act or default of any such receiver. the second priority notes collateral agent may appoint one or more receivers hereunder and may remove any such receiver or receivers and appoint another or others in his or their stead from time to time. any receiver so appointed may be an officer or employee of the second priority notes collateral agent. a court need not appoint, ratify the appointment by the second priority notes collateral agent of or otherwise supervise in any manner the actions of any receiver. upon a grantor receiving notice from the second priority notes collateral agent of the taking of possession of any transferred collateral or the appointment of a receiver, all powers, functions, rights and privileges of each of the directors and officers of such grantor with respect to any transferred collateral shall cease, unless specifically continued by the written consent of the second priority notes collateral agent. section 18. indemnity and expenses. (a) each grantor agrees to indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless each second priority secured party and each of their affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an "indemnified party") from and against, and shall pay on demand, any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any indemnified party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or resulting from this agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement of this agreement), except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such indemnified party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. (b) each grantor will upon demand pay to the second priority notes collateral agent the amount of any and all reasonable fees and expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents, that the second priority notes collateral agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of, collection from or other realization upon, any transferred collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the second priority notes collateral agent or the other second priority secured parties hereunder or (iv) the failure by such grantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. (c) in each case that the second priority notes collateral agent may or is required hereunder to take any action, including without limitation to make any determination or judgment, to give consents, to exercise rights, powers or remedies or otherwise to act hereunder, the second priority notes collateral agent may seek instruction from the holders with respect to any such action of the second priority notes collateral agent on which holders are entitled to give instruction under the second priority notes indenture. the second priority notes collateral agent shall not be liable with respect to any 22 action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with such instruction from the holders. section 19. amendments; waivers; additional grantors; etc. (a) no amendment or waiver of any provision of this agreement, and no consent to any departure by any grantor herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the second priority notes collateral agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. no failure on the part of the second priority notes collateral agent or any other second priority secured party to exercise, and no delay in exercising any right hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. (b) upon the execution and delivery, or authentication, by any person of a second priority notes security agreement supplement in substantially the form of exhibit a hereto (each a "second priority notes security agreement supplement"), such person shall be referred to as an "additional grantor" and shall be and become a grantor hereunder, and each reference in this agreement and the other second priority note documents to "grantor" shall also mean and be a reference to such additional grantor, and each reference in this agreement and the other second priority note documents to "collateral" and "transferred collateral" shall also mean and be a reference to the collateral and/or transferred collateral of such additional grantor, and the supplemental schedules i-iii attached to each second priority notes security agreement supplement shall be incorporated into and become a part of and supplement schedules i-iii, respectively, hereto, and the second priority notes collateral agent may attach such supplemental schedules to such schedules; and each reference to such schedules shall mean and be a reference to such schedules as supplemented pursuant to each second priority notes security agreement supplement. section 20. notices, etc. all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile communication) and mailed or faxed in the case of the second priority notes collateral agent, addressed to it at the corporate trust office specified in the second priority notes indenture and, in the case of each grantor, addressed to it at its address set forth opposite such grantor's name on the signature pages hereto or on the signature page to the second priority notes security agreement supplement pursuant to which it became a party hereto; or, as to any party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties. all such notices and other communications shall, when mailed or faxed, be effective when deposited in the mails, faxed or otherwise delivered (or confirmed by a signed receipt), respectively, addressed as aforesaid; except that notices and other communications to the second priority notes collateral agent shall not be effective until received by the second priority notes collateral agent. delivery by facsimile of an executed counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any provision of this agreement or of any second priority notes security agreement supplement or schedule hereto shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart thereof. 23 section 21. continuing security interest. this agreement shall create a continuing second priority security interest in the collateral and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full in cash of the secured obligations, (b) be binding upon each grantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the second priority notes collateral agent hereunder, to the benefit of the second priority secured parties and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. section 22. release of collateral; termination. (a) from and after any collateral transfer, so long as no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, the second priority notes collateral agent will release to the company or at its order (or, at the request of the company, to the second priority notes collateral agent to be applied to the secured obligations of the company under the second priority note documents), the transferred collateral to the extent permitted to be released under the terms of the second priority note documents and will, at such grantor's expense, execute and deliver to such grantor such documents as such grantor shall reasonably request to evidence the release of any collateral from the second priority security interest granted hereby to the extent permitted to be released under the terms of the second priority note documents; provided, however, that (i) at the time of such request and such release no default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) all conditions required to be satisfied under the second priority notes indenture shall have been complied with, and (iii) the grantor shall have delivered to the second priority notes collateral agent a form of release for execution by the second priority notes collateral agent and a certificate of such grantor to the effect that the transaction is in compliance with the second priority note documents and as to such other matters as the second priority notes collateral agent may request. (b) upon the payment in full in cash of the secured obligations, the pledge and second priority security interest granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the collateral shall revert to the applicable grantor, except as otherwise provided in the first priority notes indenture or the first priority notes security agreement. upon any such termination, the second priority notes collateral agent will, at the applicable grantor's expense, execute and deliver to such grantor such documents as such grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination. section 23. security interest absolute. the obligations of each grantor under this agreement are independent of the secured obligations or any other obligations of any grantor, or any affiliate of any grantor under or in respect of the second priority note documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each grantor to enforce this agreement, irrespective of whether any action is brought against such grantor or any other affiliate of any grantor or whether such grantor or any other affiliate of any grantor is joined in any such action or actions. all rights of the second priority notes collateral agent and the other second priority secured parties and the pledge, assignment and second priority security interest hereunder, and all obligations of each grantor hereunder, shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each grantor hereby irrevocably waives (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) any defenses it may 24 now have or may hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any second priority note document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the secured obligations or any other obligations of any other affiliate of a grantor under or in respect of the second priority note documents or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from any note document, including, without limitation, any increase in the secured obligations to any grantor or any of its affiliates or otherwise; (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any transferred collateral or any other collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the secured obligations;

(c) each grantor irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or any of the other second priority note documents to which it is or is to be a party in any new york state or federal court. each grantor hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit, action or proceeding in any such court.
