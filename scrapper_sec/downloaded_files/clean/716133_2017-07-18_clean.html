law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.&#160; the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this agreement in accordance with this section 8(k) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. &#160; (l)&#160; waiver of jury trial. &#160; each party
