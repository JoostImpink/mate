(b) procedures for direct claims .&#160;if any indemnified party has a claim against the indemnifying party under this article xii that does not involve a third party claim being asserted against such indemnified party (a &#8220; direct claim &#8221;), such indemnified party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice (a &#8220; direct claim notice &#8221;) setting forth a description in reasonable detail of the nature of the direct claim, the basis for the indemnified party&#8217;s request for indemnification under this article&#160;xii and a reasonable estimate (if calculable) of any losses suffered with respect to such direct claim. the failure to so deliver a direct claim notice to the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations hereunder, except only to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure. the indemnifying party shall have 30 days from receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the indemnified party. the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the indemnifying party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the indemnified party and in otherwise resolving such matters. such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters. if the indemnifying party disputes a direct claim, the indemnified party and indemnifying party shall attempt to resolve in good faith such dispute within 45 days of the indemnifying party delivering written notice to the indemnified party of such dispute. if such dispute is not so resolved within such 45 day period, then either party may initiate an action with respect to the subject matter of such dispute. &#160; 90 section 12.05. indemnification as sole and exclusive remedy . except in the case of fraud, from and after the closing, recovery pursuant to this article&#160;xii shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses relating to or arising from this agreement and the transactions, and each party hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other rights, remedies, claims and causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any), whether in contract, tort or otherwise, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, arising under or based upon any law, that any party may have against any other party in respect of any breach of this agreement; provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to deny (i) any party equitable remedies (including injunctive relief or specific performance) when any such remedy is otherwise available under this agreement or applicable law or (ii) any party or its affiliates any remedies under any transaction document. section 12.06. calculation of indemnity payments . (a) the amount of any loss for which indemnification is provided under this article&#160;xii shall be net of any amounts recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies with respect to such loss and shall also take into account any increase in applicable insurance premiums with respect to such insurance proceeds. the indemnified party shall not be entitled to be indemnified more than once for the same loss. (b) the amount of any loss for which indemnification is provided under this article&#160;xii shall be (i) increased to take account of any net tax cost incurred by the indemnified party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any net tax benefit realized by the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such loss (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such tax benefit arising in connection with the restructuring). in calculating the amount of any such tax cost or tax benefit, the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified loss. &#160; 91 (c) an indemnifying party is authorized, in connection with payment of any loss for which indemnification may be sought by an indemnified party under this article&#160;xii, to set off and apply any and all payments due to such indemnifying party under article&#160;iii or this article&#160;xii against any of and all of the obligations of the indemnifying party to such indemnified party under this article&#160;xii. the rights of the indemnifying party under this section&#160;12.06(c) are in addition to (without duplication of) other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) which such indemnifying party may have. (d) following any transfer made by indigo parent or any affiliate thereof with respect to any monsoon voting securities, indigo parent shall not be prevented or limited in any respect from enforcing the indemnification obligations of monsoon under this article&#160;xii for the benefit of the relevant transferee. section 12.07. additional matters . (a) in no event shall an indemnifying party be liable for special, punitive, exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages, or lost profits, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other law or otherwise, except to the extent that such damages are actually payable by the indemnified party in connection with a third party claim. (b) the rights of each monsoon indemnitee under section&#160;12.01(a)(i), and the rights of each indigo parent indemnitee under section&#160;12.02(a)(i), in each case after the closing shall not be affected by any knowledge at or prior to the execution of this agreement or at or prior to the closing of any breach of representation or warranty, whether such knowledge came from indigo parent, monsoon or any other person, or any waiver of section&#160;10.02(a) or section&#160;10.03(a). article xiii guarantee section 13.01. guarantee . (a) subject to section&#160;13.01(b), indigo guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, (i) the due and punctual payment of all monetary obligations and liabilities of indigo parent under this agreement and (ii) the due and punctual performance and observance of, and compliance with, all other covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, indemnities and warranties of indigo parent under or pursuant to this agreement (the obligations and liabilities referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively being referred to herein as the &#8220; guaranteed obligations &#8221;). (b) the guarantee of indigo guarantor set forth in section&#160;13.01(a) with respect to the guaranteed obligations shall automatically terminate and cease to be of any effect upon the completion of the restructuring and thereafter indigo guarantor shall not have any obligation or liability whatsoever in respect of the guaranteed obligations. (c) in the event that indigo parent or any affiliate thereof transfers any class b shares on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the closing date, such that the permitted holder ownership percentage immediately following such transfer would be less than 15%, indigo parent shall deliver to monsoon, prior to such transfer, a written guarantee of indigo guarantor (or another controlling affiliate of indigo parent reasonably acceptable to monsoon) with respect to the guaranteed obligations, which guarantee shall substantially be in the form set forth in section&#160;13.01(a). &#160; 92 article xiv general provisions section 14.01. survival .
