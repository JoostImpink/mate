as a result of the merger, the company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of nightingale. as an inducement for nightingale to enter into the merger agreement and in consideration thereof, certain directors, officers and other stockholders of the company, as identified on schedule ii (collectively, the &#147;stockholders&#148;), entered into company voting agreements with nightingale, dated as of february 16, 2007 (the &#147;voting agreements&#148;), the forms of which are filed herewith as exhibit 2 and exhibit 3 and are more fully described in item 6. nightingale did not pay any additional consideration to the stockholders in exchange for the voting agreements. pursuant to the merger agreement, nightingale will pay each company stockholder $0.75 per share in cash, which, based on the 15,358,745 shares outstanding as of february 15, 2007, as represented by the company in the merger agreement, and an additional 1,945,695 shares estimated by the company that will be issuable as a result of vested in-the-money options and warrants on or before the closing of the merger, makes the total consideration payable to the company stockholders approximately $13 million. such funds will be made available to nightingale from the bridge facility (as defined below) or the offering (as defined below), or a combination of both, as well as from internal cash resources of nightingale. in connection with the merger, nightingale has arranged a committed subordinated credit facility of cdn$15.5 million led by wellington financial lp and including export development canada, a limited partner in wellington financial fund iii (the &#147;bridge facility&#148;). the bridge facility will be a secured term loan available by way of a single draw at the closing of the merger, with cdn$6 million repayable at 12 months and cdn$9.5 million repayable at 24 months from the date of closing of the credit facility at an average interest rate of 12.75% per annum. the bridge facility will be secured against all of the assets of nightingale and the company. a commitment letter (the &#147;commitment letter&#148;) dated february 15, 2007 for the bridge facility is filed herewith as exhibit 4. availability of the bridge facility will be subject to certain customary conditions, and nightingale must comply with certain customary financial and other covenants and reporting obligations under the credit documentation which will govern and evidence the bridge facility. nightingale filed a preliminary short form prospectus with the ontario securities commission on february 26, 2007 in connection with a fully-marketed, underwritten public offering of subscription receipts in the provinces of ontario, british columbia, alberta, manitoba and quebec (the &#147;offering&#148;). each subscription receipt will entitle the holder thereof to receive, for no additional consideration, a unit (a &#147;unit&#148;) consisting of one common share and one half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a &#147;warrant&#148;) of nightingale. each warrant will entitle the holder to subscribe for one common share of nightingale for a period of 24 months from the date of issue. dundee securities corp. and clarus securities inc. have agreed to act as co-lead underwriters and together with raymond james ltd., form the syndicate of underwriters (collectively, the &#147;underwriters&#148;) for the offering. nightingale expects that the gross proceeds of the offering will be approximately cdn$15 million with the final terms of the offering to be determined at the time of pricing. closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about march 19, 2007 and is subject to, among other things, regulatory approval. the gross proceeds of the offering will be deposited in escrow pending the completion of the merger, whereupon such proceeds will be released to nightingale and the subscription receipts will automatically be exchanged for units. by having bridge facility in place, completion of the merger is not conditional upon completion of the offering. if the merger closes prior to the completion of the offering, nightingale will draw upon the bridge facility to finance the total consideration payable to the company stockholders in the merger. however, if the offering is, as nightingale expects, completed prior to the completion of the merger, nightingale will not draw on the bridge facility or only draw on part of the bridge facility. references to, and descriptions of, the merger, the merger agreement, the voting agreements and the commitment letter throughout this statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement filed herewith as exhibit 1, the forms of voting agreements filed herewith as exhibit 2 and exhibit 3 and the commitment letter filed herewith as exhibit 4.&#160;
