provisions of certain outstanding indentures of united that require united to offer to repurchase the bonds issued thereunder upon a change of control of united are rendered inapplicable (either by redemption of the bonds , defeasance in accordance with the terms of the indentures, waiver or amendment) or such a change of control occurs , other than as a result of a breach of the standstill agreement by liberty, the liberty parties will not convert any shares of new united class c common stock into new united class a common stock if, after giving effect to the conversion, the liberty parties would have more than 50% of the combined voting power of the new united class a common stock and new united class b common stock outstanding or would have more voting power than the new united class a common stock and new united class b common stock owned by the founder parties. this limitation on the liberty parties' right to convert will terminate if any person or group other than the founders acquires either 50% of the total voting power of new united or more voting power than that held by the founder parties and will not apply to conversions made by the liberty parties in connection with a sale or hedging transaction or any related pledges of their shares. change of control covenants. subject to specified exceptions for governmental licenses, new united will not take or permit any action that would result in it being subject to any page 9 of 20 covenants restricting the ability of united, new united or any of their affiliates to effect a change of control, other than such covenants contained in certain existing indentures to which united is currently subject, unless any such change of control involving or caused by the action of any liberty party (other than a tranfer of control, if control were obtained, by a liberty party to a third party) is exempted from the application and effects of any such restrictive covenants. new united will not take or permit any action to extend or perpetuate the existing change of control covenants beyond the maturity date of the bonds issued under its outstanding indentures. rights of first offer. subject to specified exceptions, no liberty party may transfer any shares of new united class b or class c common stock except to permitted transferees, or convert any such shares to new united class a common stock, unless it first offers the founders the opportunity to purchase the shares, and no founder party may transfer any shares of new united class b common stock except to permitted transferees, or convert any such shares to new united class a common stock, unless it first offers the liberty parties the opportunity to purchase the shares. if either the liberty parties or the founder parties decline to exercise their right of first offer, then the party proposing to transfer shares of new united class b or class c common stock to a third party must convert the shares to new united class a common stock immediately prior to such transfer, unless, in the case of a proposed transfer by the founder parties, the number of shares being transferred by all founder parties to the same transferee represents at least a majority of all shares of new united class b common stock owned by the founder parties, their permitted transferees, and any other person that the founder parties have designated to purchase shares from the liberty parties pursuant to the founder parties' right of first offer. prior to any event that permits the conversion of new united class c common stock into new united class b common stock, the number of shares that the liberty parties may transfer to a third party, when taken together with the number of shares of new united class a common stock previously transferred to a third party following their conversion from new united class b or class c common stock, shall not exceed the number of shares of new united class a common stock acquired after the closing of the merger from parties other than new united (including upon conversion of new united class c common stock) and the founder parties, plus the number of shares of new united class a common stock that the liberty parties receive in the merger upon conversion of any united class a common stock acquired after the execution and delivery of the merger agreement. permitted transfers. the

founders, family members and heirs of the founders and partnerships or trusts owned by or for the benefit of the founders. the liberty parties' permitted transferees include liberty and any entity

shares. pledges of the founders' shares that were in existence prior to may 25, 2001 are also allowed under the agreement. tag-along rights. if the liberty parties propose to transfer a majority of their shares of new united class b and class c common stock to persons other than permitted transferees, and page 10 of 20 the founder parties do not purchase such shares, then the founder parties will be entitled to transfer a proportionate amount of their shares of new united class b common stock to the same purchaser on no less favorable terms. if the founder parties propose to transfer a majority of their shares of new united class b common stock to persons other than permitted transferees, and the liberty parties do not purchase such shares, then the liberty parties will be entitled

parties, either (i) all of their shares of new united class b and class c common stock, (ii) all of their new united common stock or (iii) a proportionate amount of each class of new united common stock that they own; provided that the liberty parties will be required to transfer all of their new united common stock if, in connection with the proposed transfer by the founder parties, mr. gene w. schneider, g. schneider holdings, co., the gene w. schneider family trust, mr. mark l. schneider and the mls family partnership lp propose to transfer all shares of new united common stock

any other affiliate of new united (which shares were acquired from upc or such affiliate), for shares of new united class c common stock or, following the conversion of the class c common stock, class b common stock. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at anytime after upc is entitled to convert shares of its series 1 convertible preference shares held by liberty to upc ordinary shares, (i) liberty will be entitled to exchange such shares for new united class c common stock or, following the conversion of the class c common stock, class b common stock, and (ii) new united
