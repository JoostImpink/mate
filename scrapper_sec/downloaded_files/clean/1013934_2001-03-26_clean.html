0.5 rounded up to 1) of the directors entitled to be nominated by the holders of the preferred stock and, unless another purchaser joins the preferred stock purchase agreement, new mountain and dbci will be entitled to mutually appoint 1/6th of the directors entitled to be nominated by the holders of the preferred stock (rounded to the nearest whole number, with 0.5 rounded down to 0); and the rights to nominate directors by the holders of preferred stock may be adjusted for conversions of the preferred stock or the exercise of drag-along rights. the shareholders agreement is incorporated by reference herein and is filed as exhibit 1 hereto. pursuant to the preferred stock purchase agreement, the board of directors of the company approved a charter amendment that, among other things, increased the authorized number of shares of preferred stock from 5 million to 8 million. the charter amendment was approved by the company's shareholders on the escrow closing date and will become effective immediately prior to the closing. after the issuance of the shares of preferred stock under the preferred stock purchase agreement, there will be approximately 2.2 million shares of "blank check" preferred stock available for issuance. although the charter amendment was not motivated by takeover concerns and is not considered by the board of directors of the company to be an anti-takeover measure, the availability of additional authorized shares of preferred stock could enable the board of directors of the company to make more difficult, discourage, or prevent an attempt by a person, group, or entity to obtain control of the company by a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, or other means. the description of the preferred stock purchase agreement, other related agreements, other related documents and the transactions contemplated thereby ("the transaction") are not intended to be complete, and are qualified throughout by reference to such documents. in

provided, however, that beginning on the transfer restriction lapse date, db and its permitted transferees, so long as they hold at least 10% of the outstanding series a preferred stock or shares of common stock issued upon the conversion thereof, may require on one occasion during the term of their investment, the company to register for offer and sale pursuant to a registration statement on form s-3, if the company is s-3 eligible and such s-3 registration right is otherwise available, and the original majority investor shall take reasonable efforts to allow for such exercise. nothing in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to limit the ability of either the minority investors or the original minority investor to exercise their rights pursuant to section 3 (piggy-back registration) of the registration rights agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of subject securities to be registered in any offering is cut back because the managing underwriters for such offering determine that the full amount requested to be distributed cannot be included without adversely affecting the offering, the investors shall be cut back on a pro rata basis (based on their company investments at the time they exercised such "piggyback" registration rights, irrespective of who made the original registration demand). article v miscellaneous section 5.1. recapitalizations, exchanges, etc. affecting shares. the provisions of this agreement regarding the subject securities shall apply to any and all shares of capital stock of the company or any successor or assign of the company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, reorganization or otherwise) which may be issued in respect of, in exchange for, or in substitution of the subject securities by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, stock issuance, reverse stock split, combination, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise. upon the occurrence of any of such events, amounts hereunder shall be appropriately adjusted. subject only to the provisions of the preceding sentence, nothing contained in this agreement shall prohibit or restrict the company from taking any corporate action, including, without limitation, declaring any dividend (whether in cash or stock) or engaging in any corporate transaction of any kind, including, without limitation, any merger, consolidation, liquidation or sale of assets. section 5.2. waiver and amendment. any party hereto may waive its rights under this agreement at any time, and no such waiver shall operate to waive such party's rights under this agreement on any other occasion. any agreement on the part of any such party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. this agreement may be amended only by a written instrument signed by all investors. section 5.3. purchasers' agent; consultation. the investors agree that nmp shall be the purchasers' agent under the purchase agreement for purposes of responding to company requests for and providing to the company those required consents or waivers to be provided by the purchasers' agent prior to the closing date;
