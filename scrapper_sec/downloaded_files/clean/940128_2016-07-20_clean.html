(the "company") received a letter (the "letter") from the listing qualifications department (the "staff") of the nasdaq stock market ("nasdaq") notifying the company that the staff has determined that the company violated the continuing listing requirements of nasdaq's listing rule 5550(b)(1). listing rule 5550(b)(1) requires that companies listed on the nasdaq capital market are required to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity for continued listing. the company's quarterly report on form 10-q for the period ended march 31, 2016 reported stockholders' equity of negative $28,635,000. the company requested additional time to regain compliance, and presented a plan to the nasdaq listing qualifications panel (the "panel") to regain compliance. the panel granted the company's request. the company's continued listing on nasdaq is subject to, among other things, the company evidencing compliance with the minimum $2.5 million shareholder's equity requirement by august 22, 2016. on july 8, 2016, the company and each of sic iii, sic iv and sic vi entered into an exchange agreement (the "exchange agreement") pursuant to which, subject to adjustment, (i) 3,000 shares of the company's series c preferred stock owned by sic iii are to be exchanged for 17,817,950 shares of the company's common stock and (ii) all of the of debt held by sillerman, including the note, the line of credit and the revolving notes (collectively, the "sillerman notes") is to be exchanged for 101,333,088 shares of company common stock. the exchange, and thus the issuance of these shares, is conditioned upon approval of the company's shareholders, the closing of an offering of the company's common stock in the amount of at least $10,000,000, approval of its listing of additional shares application with nasdaq, the company not being subject to any bankruptcy proceeding, and various other conditions. the price at which the sillerman notes and the series c preferred stock is being exchanged (the "exchange price") equals the lesser of $0.26 and the price at which the debentures (as defined below) can be exchanged for shares of the company's common stock, so long as the company received a valuation that the exchange price reflects fair value. the exchange agreement provides for termination in the event the conditions are not satisfied by march 31, 2017. the "debentures" means those various debentures, dated as of july 12, 2016, between the company and various investors in the aggregate principal amount of $4,444,444.44. the debentures are convertible initially at any time at the option of the holder into shares of the company's common stock at an initial conversion price of $0.3133 per share (the "conversion price"). if the company issues or sells shares of its common stock, rights to purchase shares of its common stock, or securities convertible into shares of its common stock for a price per share that is less than the conversion price then in effect, the conversion price then in effect will be decreased to equal such lower price. if this occurs, the exchange price as set forth in the exchange agreement could be reduced. the exchange agreement will help increase the amount of stockholders equity on the company's balance sheet to help the company achieve minimum levels of stockholders equity as required by nasdaq. in addition, exchanging the sillerman notes and the series c preferred stock will allow the company to have a more attractive balance sheet that may facilitate future capital raising activities. because mr. sillerman is a director, executive officer and greater than 10% stockholder of the company, a majority of the company's independent directors approved the transaction described in the exchange agreement. the foregoing description of the exchange agreement is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the exchange agreement, a copy of which is attached as exhibit 3.10 and incorporated herein by reference. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. item 5 of the statement is hereby amended and restated as follows: (a)(b) as of june 3, 2016, the reporting person is the beneficial owner of, and holds the sole power to vote or to direct the vote and sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of 162,268 shares of common stock, and shared power to vote or to dispose or to direct the disposition of 42,049,331 shares of common stock. accordingly, that total of 42,211,599 represents approximately 67.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock. these shares consist of: 1. 30,811,268 shares of common stock held by sillerman investment company iii llc ("sic iii"), of which the reporting person is the sole member and manager;
