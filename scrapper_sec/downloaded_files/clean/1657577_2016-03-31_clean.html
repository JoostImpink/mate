(a) if a party holding in excess one-third (1/3) of the total number of party shares (the &ldquo; transferor &rdquo;) elects to sell (either in a single or a series of related transactions) shares representing 50% or more of the party&rsquo;s shares (such party&rsquo;s shares desired to be so transferred, the &ldquo; transferor shares &rdquo;)) to an unaffiliated third party (a &ldquo; drag-tag buyer &rdquo;), then, at least 30 days prior to the date upon which the party intends to consummate such transfer, the transferor shall give written notice thereof which notice shall set forth the consideration to be paid by the drag-tag buyer, and the other material terms and conditions of such transaction (such notice, the &ldquo; transferor notice &rdquo;) to each party and the parties&rsquo; representative that the transferor desires (the &ldquo; drag-along right &rdquo;) that each such party transfer in the transaction the percentage of its party shares equal to the percentage of the transferor shares being transferred in the transaction compared to all of party shares owned by the party at that time (the &ldquo; ratable percentage shares &rdquo;) and on the same terms and conditions, including price, upon which the transferor is transferring the transferor shares. the parties shall, subject to the provisions of this section 2.05 , consent to and raise no objections against such transfer by the party and, if requested to do so by the transferor in the transferor notice, transfer their respective ratable percentage shares, subject to the provisions of this section 2.05 , on the same terms and conditions upon which the transferor is transferring the transferor shares. (b) if the transferor proposes to sell transferor shares pursuant to any transaction or series of related transactions as to which the transferor would be entitled to exercise the drag-along right but the transferor does not so elect to exercise the drag-along right, then, as a condition to such transfer, each party shall have the right (the &ldquo; tag-along right &rdquo;) to sell to the drag-tag buyer, at such party&rsquo;s option, such party&rsquo;s ratable percentage shares (as calculated in the same manner as set forth in section 2.05(a) ), on the same terms and conditions and at the same price as are applicable to the transferor shares. in the event that the tag-along right applies with respect to a proposed transfer of transferor shares, then (i) the transferor shall provide notice thereof in the transferor notice and (ii) each party shall have 30 days following receipt of the transferor notice to elect to sell all or a portion of such party&rsquo;s ratable percentage shares. the failure of a party to notify the transferor of its election of the tag-along right within such 30 day period shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of such party&rsquo;s tag-along right with respect to such transfer. if the drag-tag buyer is unwilling to purchase the transferor shares and all of the party shares desired to be sold by parties exercising the tag-along right, then, at the transferor&rsquo;s sole option, either (i) the transaction shall not be consummated or (ii) each of the transferor shares and the party shares desired to be sold in the transaction by parties exercising the tag-along right shall be ratably reduced to equal an amount of shares determined by multiplying the transferor shares or the applicable party shares, as the case may be, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares which the drag-tag buyer agrees to purchase in the transaction and the denominator of which is the total number of transferor shares and party shares desired to be sold in the transaction. 8 (c) if the transferor exercises the drag-along right, each party shall, and each party who exercises the tag-along right shall, take such actions as reasonably necessary to consummate the applicable transaction, including, without limitation, to execute and deliver a definitive purchase and sale (or other similar) agreement, in substantially the same form and substance as the definitive agreement executed and delivered by the transferor; provided, that (i) if the transferor exercises the drag-along right, no party will be required to provide representations and warranties other than several (and not joint) representations and warranties, and indemnities with respect thereto, substantially similar in scope and substance (other than to conform the same to the applicable transaction) to the representations and warranties made by the dk shareholders in the agreement, and (ii) if the tag-along right is exercised, (a) the representations and warranties relating specifically to a party participating in the transaction shall be made only by such party and any indemnification provided by any party participating in the transaction with respect to the company, if any, shall be based on the shares being transferred by each of them vis a vis all of the shares in the company being transferred in the transaction, on a several, not joint, basis, (b) no party shall be required to provide any indemnity in such transaction that provides for liability to such party in excess of the amount of proceeds actually received by such party in such transaction, and (c) each of the transferor and each party participating in the transaction shall bear its pro rata share of the costs of the transactions based on the net proceeds to be received by each such person in connection with the transaction to the extent such costs are incurred for the benefit of persons selling shares in the transaction and are not paid by the drag-tag buyer. (d) the transferor shall have 120 days following the date of the transferor notice in which to consummate a transaction subject to this section 2.05 on the terms set forth in the transferor notice (which 120-day period shall be extended for a reasonable time to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain any regulatory approvals or if necessary to enable the transferor and any party as an insider of the company to engage in a transaction in the securities of the company). if at the end of such period, the transferor has not completed the transaction other than as a result of any action or inaction by a party in breach of this agreement, the transferor may not then effect a transaction subject to this section 2.05 without again fully complying with the provisions of this section 2.05 . 9 article iii representations and warranties section 3.01 representations and warranties. each party, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to each of the other parties, severally and not jointly, that: (a) if such stockholder is not a natural person, such stockholder is duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is formed, and has the requisite power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted;
