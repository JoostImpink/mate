o against any action that is reasonably likely to result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation of the company under the merger agreement;

and o to the extent such action is reasonably likely to materially impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the merger or the merger agreement in any material respect, -- against any change in a majority of the company's board of directors other than in connection with an annual meeting of the company's stockholders with respect to the slate of directors proposed by the incumbent board of directors (in which case ackerley agrees to vote for the slate proposed by the incumbent board of directors), or -- against any material change in the company's corporate structure or business (except for those actions contemplated by the merger agreement). page 7 of 14 pages cusip no. 004527107 in connection with the voting agreement, ackerley also agreed to deliver to clear channel an irrevocable proxy (the "proxy") coupled with an interest with respect to such 9,002,855 shares of common stock, thereby allowing clear channel to vote such shares at any time prior to the date the merger is effectuated or the date the merger agreement is terminated, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the voting agreement. if (i) any of the shares of common stock subject to the voting agreement or any shares of class b common stock held by ackerley or deemed to be beneficially owned by ackerley are disposed of in connection with any acquisition proposal, or (ii) the amount of merger consideration to be received by the holders of common stock and class b common stock is increased, ackerley has agreed to pay to clear channel or waive the right to be paid (in the event of an increase in merger consideration, if clear channel so requests) a certain percentage of the profits from such alternative transaction or increase in merger consideration, as the case may be. in addition, ackerley, pursuant to the terms of the voting agreement, may not, unless contemplated by the merger agreement, without clear channel's consent: o offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement with respect to or consent to the offer for sale, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of, any or all of his common stock, or any interest therein; o grant any proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any of his common stock into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any of such common stock; o enter into an agreement or arrangement providing for any of the actions described above; o take any action that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or disabling ackerley from performing his obligations under the voting agreement; or o request that the company register the transfer of any certificated or uncertificated interest representing any of his common stock (other than as contemplated by the voting agreement). the description contained in this item 4 of the transactions contemplated by the voting agreement and proxy are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the voting agreement and proxy, both of which are incorporated herein by reference and filed as exhibit 99(b) hereto.
