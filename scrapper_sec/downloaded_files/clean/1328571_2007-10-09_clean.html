registering shareholder holding registrable securities covered by a registration statement, its officers, directors, employees, partners and agents, and each person, if any, who controls such shareholder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) (&#147; damages &#148;) caused by or relating to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities (as amended or supplemented if the company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements ther eto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by or relating to any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such damages are caused by or related to any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission so made based upon information furnished in writing to the company by such shareholder or on such shareholder&#146;s behalf expressly for use therein, provided that, with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus, or in any prospectus, as the case may be, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that any damages result from the fact that a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) was not sent or given to the person asserting any such damages at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities concerned to such person if it is determined that the company has provided such prospectus to such shareholder and it was the responsibility of such shareholder to provide such person with a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) and such current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) would have cured the defect giving rise to such damages. the company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the shareholders provided in this &#8206;section 5.05. section 5.06. indemnification by participating shareholders . each registering shareholder holding registrable securities included in any registration statement agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold 31 harmless the company, its officers, directors and agents and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to such shareholder, but only (i) with respect to information furnished in writing by such shareholder or on such shareholder&#146;s behalf expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus or (ii) to the extent that any damages result from the fact that a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) was not sent or given to the person asserting any such damages at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities concerned to such person if it is determined that it was the responsibility of such shareholder to provide such person with a current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) and such current copy of the prospectus (or such amended or supplemented prospectus, as the case may be) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. each such shareholder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the company provided in this &#8206;section 5.06. as a condition to including registrable securities in any registration statement filed in accordance with &#8206;article 5, the company may require that it shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from any underwriter to inde mnify and hold it harmless to the extent customarily provided by underwriters with respect to similar securities. no registering shareholder shall be liable under this &#8206;section 5.06 for any damages in excess of the net proceeds realized by such shareholder in the sale of registrable securities of such shareholder to which such damages relate. section 5.07. conduct of indemnification proceedings . if any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this &#8206;article 5, such person (an &#8220; indemnified party &#8221;) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the &#147; indemnifying party &#148;) in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses, provided that the failure of any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to notify. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such 32 indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. in the case of any such separate firm for the indemnified parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, no indemnifying party shall effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such proceeding. section 5.08. contribution . if the indemnification provided for in this &#8206;article 5 is unavailable to the indemnified parties in respect of any damages, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such damages (i) as between the company and the registering shareholders holding registrable securities covered by a registration statement on the one hand and the underwriters on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company and such shareholders on the one hand and the underwriters on the other, from the offering of the registrable securities, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits but also the relative fault o f the company and such shareholders on the one hand and of such underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such damages, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations and (ii) as between the company on the one hand and each such shareholder on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company and of each such shareholder in connection with such statements or omissions, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by the company and such shareholders on the one hand and such underwriters on the other shall be deemed 33 to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the company and such shareholders bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the prospectus. the relative fault of the company and such shareholders on the one hand and of such underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company and such shareholders or by such underwriters. the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of each such shareholder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged unt rue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and the registering shareholders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this &#8206;section 5.08 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the damages referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this &#8206;section 5.08, no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no registering shareholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities of such shareholder were offered to the public (less underwriters&#146; discounts and commissions) exceeds the amount of any damages that such shareholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. each registering shareholder&#146;s obligation to contribute pur suant to this &#8206;section 5.08 is several in the proportion that the proceeds of the 34 offering received by such shareholder bears to the total proceeds of the offering received by all such registering shareholders and not joint. section 5.09. participation in public offering . no person may participate in any public offering hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell such person&#146;s securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and the provisions of this agreement in respect of registration rights. section 5.10. other indemnification . indemnification similar to that specified herein (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each registering shareholder participating therein with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation or governmental authority other than the securities act. section 5.11. cooperation by the company . if any shareholder shall transfer any registrable securities pursuant to rule 144, the company shall cooperate, to the extent commercially reasonable, with such shareholder and shall provide to such shareholder such information as such shareholder shall reasonably request. section 5.12. no transfer of registration rights . none of the rights of shareholders under this &#8206;article 5 shall be assignable by any shareholder to any person acquiring securities in any public offering or pursuant to rule 144. article 6 certain covenants and agreements section 6.01. confidentiality. (a) each shareholder agrees that confidential information (as defined below) furnished and to be furnished to it was and will be made available in connection with such shareholder&#146;s investment in the company. each shareholder agrees that it will use, and that it will cause any person to whom confidential information is disclosed pursuant to clause (i) below to use, the confidential information only in connection with its investment in the company and not for any other purpose (including, without limitation, to disadvantage competitively the company or any management shareholder). each shareholder further acknowledges and agrees that it will not disclose any confidential information to any person, provided that confidential information may be disclosed (i) to such shareholder&#146;s representatives (as defined below) in the normal course of t he performance of their duties or to any financial institution 35 providing credit to such shareholder, (ii) to the extent required by applicable law, rule or regulation (including complying with any oral or written questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process to which a shareholder is subject, provided that such shareholder gives the company prompt notice of such request(s), to the extent practicable, so that the company may seek an appropriate protective order or similar relief (and the shareholder shall cooperate with such efforts by the company, and shall in any event make only the minimum disclosure required by such law, rule or regulation)), (iii) to any person to whom such shareholder is contemplating a transfer of its company securities ( provided that such transfer would not be in violation of the provisions of this agreement and as long as such potential transferee is advised of the confiden tial nature of such information and agrees to be bound by a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company and consistent with the provisions hereof), (iv) to any regulatory authority or rating agency to which the shareholder or any of its affiliates is subject or with which it has regular dealings, as long as such authority or agency is advised of the confidential nature of such information or (v) if the prior written consent of the board shall have been obtained. nothing contained herein shall prevent the use (subject, to the extent possible, to a protective order) of confidential information in connection with the assertion or defense of any claim by or against the company or any shareholder. (b) &#147; confidential information &#148; means any information concerning the company and persons that are or become its subsidiaries or the financial condition, business, operations or prospects of the company and persons that are or become its subsidiaries in the possession of or furnished to any shareholder (including, without limitation by virtue of its present or former right to designate a director of the company), provided that the term &#147;
