finally judicially determined that such liabilities resulted primarily from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such company indemnified party; provided, further, that if and to the extent that such indemnification is unenforceable for any reason, the purchaser shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such indemnified liability which shall be permissible under applicable laws. in connection with the obligation of the purchaser to indemnify for expenses as set forth above, the purchaser further agrees to reimburse each company indemnified party for all such expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel) incurred by such company indemnified party on a monthly basis (subject to receipt of customary invoices and other appropriate documentation); provided, however, that if a company indemnified party is reimbursed hereunder for any expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall be refunded to the extent it is finally judicially determined that the liabilities in question resulted primarily from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such company indemnified party. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, any claim for indemnification under this section 7.2 shall be limited solely to the assets of the purchaser and shall not be made against or in any way be construed to include the assets of brown brothers harriman & co. in addition, the indemnification provided by the purchaser in this section 7.2 shall be limited as follows: the purchaser shall not be obligated to pay any amount for indemnification in excess of the purchase price paid by the purchaser. 7.3 notification. each indemnified party under this article 7 will, promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action or other proceeding against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought 29 from the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, under this article 7, notify the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, in writing of the commencement thereof. the omission of any indemnified party so to notify the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, of any such action shall not relieve the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party (i) other than pursuant to this article 7 or (ii) under this article 7, except to the extent the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, is prejudiced by such omission. in case any such action or other proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, of the commencement thereof, the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that any indemnified party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense. notwithstanding the foregoing, in any action or proceeding in which both the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, and an indemnified party is, or is reasonably likely to become, a party, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the company's or the purchaser's, as the case may be, expense and to control its own defense of such action or proceeding if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, (a) there are or may be legal defenses available to such indemnified party or to other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, or (b) any conflict or potential conflict exists between the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, and such indemnified party that would make such separate representation advisable; provided, however, that in no event shall the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, be required to pay fees and expenses under this section 7 for more than one firm of attorneys in any jurisdiction in any one legal action or group of related legal actions. the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, agrees that the company or the purchaser, as the case may be, will not, without the prior written consent of the purchaser or the company, as the case may be (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned or withheld), settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated hereby (if any indemnified party is a party thereto or has been actually threatened to be made a party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the purchaser or the company, as the case may be, and each other indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding. the rights accorded to indemnified parties hereunder shall be in addition to any rights that any indemnified party may have at common law, by separate agreement or otherwise. 7.4 registration rights agreement. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article 7, the indemnification and contribution provisions of the registration rights

(ii) in case the corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the original issue date issue shares of common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for class a common stock, or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of class a common stock) for a consideration per share less than either the conversion price or the current market price per share of class a common stock (in each case, then in effect at the record date or issuance date, as the case may be (the "date")) (treating the price per share of any security convertible or exchangeable or exercisable into class a common stock as equal to (a) the sum of the 13 price for such security convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into class a common stock plus any additional consideration payable (without regard to any anti-dilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such security into class a common stock divided by (b) the number of shares of class a common stock initially underlying such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security), then, and in each such case, the conversion price then in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the conversion price in effect on the day immediately prior to the date by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of class a common stock outstanding on the date plus the number of additional shares of class a common stock issued or to be issued (or the maximum number into which such convertible or exchangeable securities initially may convert or exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights initially may be exercised) and (y) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of class a common stock outstanding on the date plus the number of shares of class a common stock which the aggregate consideration for the total number of such additional shares of class a common stock so issued or be issued upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities or options, warrants or other rights (plus the aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon such conversion, exchange or exercise of such security) would purchase at the greater of the conversion price or current market price per share of class a common stock on the date, as the case may be. notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion price shall not be adjusted where, pursuant to an arms' length transaction with a non-affiliate, the corporation issues shares of class a common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for class a common stock or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire class a common stock) for a consideration per share less than either the conversion price then in effect or the current market price per share of class a common stock if issued as all or a portion of the purchase price for the stock or assets of another corporation. such adjustment shall be made whenever such shares, securities, options, warrants or other rights are issued, and shall become effective retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business (1) in the case of issuance to stockholders of the corporation, as such, on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such shares, securities, options, warrants or other rights and (2) in all other cases, on the date ("issuance date") of such issuance; provided that: (a) the determination as to whether an adjustment is required to be made pursuant to this section 8(d)(ii) shall be made upon the issuance of such shares or such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights; (b) if any convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights (or any portions thereof) which shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to section 8(d)(i) or this section 8(d)(ii) shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or if by reason of the terms of such 14 convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights there shall have been an increase or increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the exercise or conversion thereof, then the conversion price hereunder shall be readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally adjusted) on the basis of (x) eliminating from the computation any additional shares of class a common stock corresponding to such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights as shall have expired or terminated, (y) treating the additional shares of class a common stock, if any, actually issued or issuable pursuant to the previous exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights as having been issued for the consideration actually received and receivable therefor and (z) treating any of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights which remain outstanding as being subject to exercise or conversion on the basis of such exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at this time; and (c) no adjustment in the conversion price shall be made pursuant to this section 8(d)(ii) as a result of any issuance of securities by the corporation in respect of which an adjustment to the conversion price is made pursuant to section 8(d)(i).

(v) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this section 8(d) need be made to the conversion price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the conversion price then in effect. any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% of such conversion price. any adjustment to the conversion price carried forward and not theretofore made shall be made immediately prior to the conversion of any shares of preferred stock pursuant hereto.

(e) if the corporation shall take a record of the holders of its class a common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the conversion price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record. (f) promptly following any increase or decrease in the conversion price, the corporation shall deliver to each registered holder of preferred stock a certificate, signed by the president or a vice president and by the treasurer or an - ---------- 1/ as in effect upon signing. 16 assistant treasurer or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased conversion price then in effect following such adjustment. (g) no fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any shares of preferred stock. if more than one share of preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares of preferred stock so surrendered. if the conversion of any share or shares of preferred stock results in a fraction, an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the current market price of the class a common stock on the business day preceding the day of conversion shall be paid to such holder in cash by the corporation.

(a) indemnification by the company. the company will, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, in the case of any registration statement filed pursuant to section 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3, each seller of any registrable securities covered by such registration statement and each other person, if any, who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, and their respective directors, officers, partners, members, agents and affiliates against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such seller or underwriter or any such director, officer, partner, member, agent, affiliate or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel (including those incurred in connection with any claim for indemnity hereunder), insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and the company will reimburse such seller or underwriter and each such director, officer, partner, member, agent, affiliate and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable in 14 any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by or on behalf of such seller or underwriter, as the case may be, specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof; and provided further, that the company shall not be liable to any person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of registrable securities or any other person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, or, to the extent required by law, selling stockholder, in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding, in respect thereof) or expense arises out of such person's or selling stockholder's, as the case may be, failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may have been supplemented or amended, to the person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of registrable securities to such person if such statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus and such person or selling stockholder, as the case may be, was required by law to send or give a copy of a prospectus to the person making such assertions. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such seller or any such director, officer, partner, member, agent or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. (b) indemnification by the sellers. as a condition to including any registrable securities in any registration statement, the company shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the prospective seller of such registrable securities, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 2.8(a)) the company, and each director of the company, each officer of the company and each other person, if any, who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person who controls the company or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, with respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such seller specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however, that the liability of such indemnifying party under this section 2.8(b) shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such indem nifying party in the offering giving rise to such liability. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. 15 (c) notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) involving a claim referred to in section 2.8(a) or (b), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.8, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that any indemnified party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense. notwith standing the foregoing, in any action or proceeding in which both the company and an indemnified party is, or is reasonably likely to become, a party, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the company's expense and to control its own defense of such action or proceeding if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, (a) there are or may be legal defenses available to such indemnified party or to other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the company or (b) any conflict or potential conflict exists between the company and such indemnified party that would make such separate representation advisable; provided, however, that in no event shall the company be required to pay fees and expenses under this section 2.8 for more than one firm of attorneys in any jurisdiction in any one legal action or group of related legal actions. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld unless the indemnifying party shall have agreed in writing in a form satisfactory to the indemnified party to pay any amount (and not challenge an indemnified party's right to indemnification under this section 2.8) required to be paid to settle a claim, in which case the indemnifying party may grant or withhold its consent in its sole discretion. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or which requires action other than the payment of money by the indemnifying party. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.8 shall for any reason be held by a court to be unavailable to an indemnified party under section 2.8(a) or (b) hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in lieu of the amount paid or payable under section 2.8(a) or (b), the indemnified party and the indemnifying party under section 2.8(a) or (b) shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating the same, including those incurred in connection with any claim for 16 indemnity hereunder), (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company and the prospective sellers of registrable securities covered by the registration statement which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in respect thereof, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company and such prospective sellers from the offering of the securities covered by such registration statement; provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (ii), the relative benefits received by the prospective sellers shall be deemed not to exceed the amount of proceeds received by such prospective sellers. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. such prospective sellers' obligations to contribute as provided in this section 2.8(d) are several in proportion to the relative value of their respective registrable securities covered by such registration statement and not joint. in addition, no person shall be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement of any action or claim effected without such person's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (e) other indemnification. indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.8 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each seller of registrable securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation of any governmental authority other than the securities act. (f) indemnification payments. the indemnification and contribution required by this section 2.8 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred. 3. definitions. as used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms have the following respective meanings: "certificate of designation" means the certificate of designation of the series a preferred stock.

(b) if at any time mbf desires to transfer 15% or more of the shares of common stock directly owned (whether jointly or severally) by him (which, 4 for purposes of this section 2 shall include shares owned by the estate of frances a. fuller (until distributed in accordance with section 2(f)), but exclude shares owned by the overlook estate foundation, inc. or the frances a. fuller family trust) in a single or series of related private transactions to a person other than a permitted transferee or as set forth in section 2(f), and, so long as the purchaser owns 20% of the shares of common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock, mbf shall notify the company and the purchaser of such desire (the "transfer notice"). the purchaser shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the company and to mbf prior to the expiration of the election period, to participate in such transfer on a pro rata basis on the same terms and conditions as mbf. in the event that the purchaser elects to participate in a transfer pursuant to this section 2(b), mbf and the purchaser shall be entitled to sell in such transfer the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares covered by the transfer notice by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock or common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock held by mbf or the purchaser (determined on a fully diluted basis), as the case may be, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock or common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock held by both mbf and the purchaser (determined on a fully diluted basis). mbf shall not effect any transfer subject to this section 2(b) unless the purchaser agrees to the participation of the purchaser in such transaction as specified above or, in the alternative, mbf purchases the shares that the purchaser is entitled to include in such transfer on the terms set forth in the transfer notice concurrently with the closing of such transfer. for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that this section 2(b) does not apply to transfers by mbf, in a single or series of related transactions that do not exceed, individually or in the aggregate, 15% or more of the shares of common stock directly owned by him. (c) permitted transfers. the restrictions set forth in this section 2 shall not apply to transfers of common stock to (i) a member of mbf's immediate family, which shall include mbf, his spouse, siblings (except as set forth in section 2(f)), children or grandchildren ("family members") or (ii) a trust, corporation, partnership or limited liability company, all of the beneficial interests in which shall be held by mbf or one or more family members of mbf; provided, however, that during the period that any such trust, corporation, partnership or limited liability company holds any right, title or interest in any shares of common stock, no person other than mbf or one or more family members of mbf may be or may become beneficiaries, stockholders, limited or general partners or members thereof (the persons referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are each referred to hereinafter as a "permitted transferee"). a permitted transferee of shares of common stock pursuant to this section 2(c) may transfer shares of common stock received after the date hereof pursuant to this section 2(c) only to mbf or to a person that is a permitted transferee. mbf shall not avoid the provisions of this agreement by making one or more transfers to one or more permitted transferees and then disposing of all or any portion of mbf's interest in any such permitted transferee, and any transfer or attempted transfer in violation of this covenant shall be null and void ab initio. 5 (d) permitted transfer procedures. if mbf wishes to transfer shares of common stock to a permitted transferee under section 2(c), mbf shall give notice to the company of his intention to make such a transfer not less than seven (7) days prior to effecting such transfer, which notice shall state the name and address of each permitted transferee to whom such transfer is proposed, the relationship of such permitted transferee to mbf, and the number of shares of common stock proposed to be transferred to such permitted transferee. (e) transfers in compliance with law; substitution of transferee. except as set forth in section 2(f), notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, no transfer may be made pursuant to this section 2 to a permitted transferee unless (a) the permitted transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement pursuant to an instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the company, (b) the transfer complies in all respects with the applicable provisions of this agreement and (c) the transfer complies in all respects with applicable federal and state securities laws, including, without limitation, the securities act. upon becoming a party to this agreement, a permitted transferee shall be substituted for, and shall enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same obligations as mbf hereunder with respect to the shares of common stock transferred to such permitted transferee. (f) exempt transactions. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the restrictions set forth in this section 2 shall not apply to (i) transfers of common stock to permit mbf to, directly or indirectly, satisfy his obligations under the agreement, dated may 13, 1997, between mbf and suzanne fuller; provided, however, that such transfers do not, individually or in the aggregate, exceed 45,000 shares of common stock, (ii) sales of common stock by financial institutions pursuant to pledge agreements executed by mbf and existing as of the date of this agreement, or (iii) distributions of common stock by the estate of frances a. fuller to patricia a. fuller or frances f. gunster, whether directly or in trust. for the avoidance of doubt, the transferees in transactions effected pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be required to agree in writing to or otherwise be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. 3. other agreements.

(b) this agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and cannot be modified or amended except in writing signed by the parties hereto.
