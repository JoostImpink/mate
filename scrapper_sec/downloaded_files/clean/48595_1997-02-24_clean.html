financing partnership, a delaware general partnership ("slt financing" and together with slt and slc, the "starwood partnerships"), the trust, the corporation, and the other parties listed on the signature pages thereto, prudential contributed to the starwood partnerships (a)(i) certain limited liability company membership interests, limited partnership interests, joint venture interests and

entities (the "property companies") owned a single hotel (a "hotel") and (ii) certain tangible and intangible personal property assets owned by the property companies in connection with the operation of the hotels, in exchange for (b) (i) 4,529,037 units, (ii) approximately $2,340,000 in cash, (iii) $72,000,000 represented by a joint note of trust and slt (described more fully below) and (iv) the assumption by trust and slt of certain debt encumbering the hotels. the contribution agreement contemplates that prudential receive units, cash and the assumption of certain debt in exchange for its interests in the property companies and the intangible and tangible assets referenced in page 4 of 14 pages clause (a)(ii) above. in lieu of the payment of $72,000,000 in cash to prudential on the closing date pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement, prudential orally agreed with slt and the trust to accept a joint note in the principal amount of $72,000,000. subsequent to such oral

the trust pursuant to the contribution agreement. accordingly, a joint note in the principal amount of $97,500,000 (the "note") was issued to prudential by slt and the trust on february 14, 1997 (the "closing date"). pursuant to the terms of the note, slt and the trust jointly and severally agree to pay (i) $25,500,000, together with interest accrued thereon, on or prior to february 20, 1997 and (ii) the balance of the note, together with interest accrued thereon, on april 15, 1997 (unless slt and the trust notify prudential on or prior to april 11, 1997 of their election to extend the date of payment, in which case the date of payment shall be extended to may 14, 1997). interest on the unpaid principal amount of the note accrues at a fixed rate per annum equal to 7.00%; provided that any amount not paid when due bears interest at a rate that is 6.00% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable under the note. on february 20, 1997 slt and the trust paid $25,500,000, plus accrued interest, to prudential pursuant to the terms of the note. the foregoing descriptions of the contribution agreement and the note are qualified in their entirety by reference to the contribution agreement and the note, respectively, copies of which are filed as exhibit i and exhibit ii hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. on the closing date, immediately after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the contribution agreement, prudential tendered 2,775,000 units to the companies pursuant to the units exchange rights agreement referenced in item 6 in exchange for 2,775,000 paired shares. item 4. purpose of transaction prudential acquired and is holding the units and paired shares owned by it on behalf of prisa ii and the paired shares owned by it on behalf of prudential diversified for investment purposes and without the intention of effecting a change in control of the companies or slt or slc. notwithstanding the foregoing, depending on market conditions, prudential may choose to acquire additional units or paired shares, exchange some of its units for paired shares, or dispose of some or all of its units or paired shares. page 5 of 14 pages except as set forth in the three immediately following sentences, neither prudential, nor to prudential's knowledge, any of the persons identified on schedule a has any plans or proposals that would result in or relate to any of the transactions described in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement, the trust shall not later than fifteen days after the closing date take all necessary action to increase the number of trustees of the trust by two and, subject to certain approvals of the gaming authorities of clark county, nevada and the state of nevada, nominate and support for election to the board of trustees of the trust gary m. mendell, the president of the trust (and one of the indirect owners of the property companies prior to the closing date), and roger s. pratt, a managing director of prudential. pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement, for so long as prudential shall maintain the minimum share ownership (as defined below), prudential shall continue to be entitled to designate, subject to certain approvals of the gaming authorities of clark county, nevada and the state of nevada, one representative to be nominated for election to the board of trustees of the trust at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the trust called for the purpose of electing trustees. "minimum share ownership" means either (i) ownership by prudential of a total number of units plus paired shares which (in the aggregate) equals fifty percent (50%) or more of the aggregate number of units received by prudential on the closing date pursuant to the contribution agreement, or (ii) that prudential is one of the five largest shareholders of the trust on a fully diluted basis (assuming, for purposes of such calculation, that all outstanding units (other than those owned by the trust and the corporation) have been converted into paired shares). item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) prudential beneficially owns 2,779,500 paired shares, or approximately 6.5% of the 42,924,490 paired shares issued and outstanding as of the closing date (after giving effect to the issuance to prudential of 2,775,000 paired shares on the closing date). of such 2,779,500 paired shares, prudential beneficially owns 2,775,000 paired shares on behalf of prisa ii and 4,500 paired shares on behalf of prudential diversified. in addition, prudential beneficially owns on behalf of prisa ii 1,754,037 units that may be exchanged, under certain circumstances, for paired shares on a 1-for-1 basis. if all of the units beneficially owned by prudential were exchanged for paired shares, prudential would beneficially own 4,533,537 paired shares, or approximately 10.1% of the 44,678,527 paired shares that would be issued and outstanding after such exchange, based on the number of paired shares issued and outstanding as of the closing date. the page 6 of 14 pages declaration of trust of the trust and the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, however, prohibit any person from directly or indirectly owning more than 8% of the paired shares. prudential securities inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of prudential ("psi"), beneficially owns 27,875 paired shares in certain discretionary accounts on behalf of clients of psi. prudential disclaims beneficial ownership of such paired shares because the management of psi, and not prudential, directs the disposition and/or voting, if any, of such paired shares. (b) prudential has the sole power to vote or to direct the vote and sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of the paired shares beneficially owned by it. (c) except as specified above in item 3, prudential has not effected any transactions in the paired shares or units during the past 60 days. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of issuer as described in item 3 above, prudential entered into the contribution agreement as of january 15, 1997. pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement, on the closing date prudential was issued 4,529,037 units and entered into the partnership agreements of slt and slc. immediately following the issuance of such units, prudential exchanged 2,775,000 of such units for 2,775,000 paired shares. as described in item 4 above, the contribution agreement (i) obligates the trust to nominate and support for election to the board of trustees of the trust gary m. mendell, the president of the trust (and one of the indirect owners of the property companies prior to the closing date), and roger s. pratt, a managing director of prudential and (ii) grants prudential the right to continue to be entitled to designate one representative to be nominated for election to the board of trustees of the trust at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the trust called for the purpose of electing trustees for so long as prudential maintains the minimum share ownership. the foregoing description of the contribution agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the contribution agreement, a copy of which is filed as exhibit i hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. page 7 of 14 pages prudential also entered into a registration rights agreement (the "registration rights agreement") dated as of february 14, 1997 among the trust, the corporation, prudential and the persons listed on the signature pages thereto. pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the trust and the corporation have agreed, prior to the date that is six months after the date of the registration rights agreement, to file a registration statement under rule 415 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, registering the paired shares to be issued to prudential and the other parties to the registration rights agreement upon the exchange of the units issued to them pursuant to the contribution agreement. the trust and the corporation agree in the registration rights agreement to use their reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective until all of the paired shares covered thereby have been sold. in the event that the trust and the corporation are unable to cause such registration statement to be declared effective or are unable to keep such registration statement effective for such period, prudential and the other parties thereto have been granted certain other demand, shelf and piggyback registration rights as set forth therein. the foregoing description of the registration rights agreement is qualified in its entirely by reference to such registration rights agreement, a copy of which is filed as exhibit iii hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. prudential also entered into a units exchange rights agreement (the "exchange rights agreement") dated as of february 14, 1997 among the trust, the corporation, slt, slc, prudential and the persons listed on the signature pages thereto. pursuant to the terms of the exchange rights agreement, prudential has the right to tender the units owned by it to the trust and the corporation. not later than fifteen days after such tender, the trust and the corporation shall elect to pay for such units by delivering to prudential either (i) paired shares (based on a one unit for one paired share exchange ratio), (ii) cash (based on the average closing price for paired shares for the ten trading day period ending one day prior to the date of such tender) or (iii) a combination of paired shares and cash. under no circumstances may paired shares or cash be issued or paid in respect of any tender of units if, among other things: (i) such issuance or payment would result in any entity owning paired shares in excess of 8% of the outstanding paired shares, (ii) such issuance or payment would result in the trust not satisfying certain requirements under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), with respect to the qualification of the trust under the code as a real estate investment trust or (iii) if certain regulatory approvals, including without limitation approvals of the gaming authorities of the state of nevada and clark county, nevada, with respect to such issuance and payment have not been obtained. the foregoing description of the exchange page 8 of 14 pages rights agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the units exchange rights agreement, a copy of which is filed as exhibit iv hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. the filing of this statement should not be construed as an admission that prudential is or was for the purposes of section 13 or section 16 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, the beneficial owner of the paired shares listed herein item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit no. description ----------- ----------- i contribution agreement dated as of january 15, 1997 ii purchase money promissory note

(a) estimated closing balance sheet. net working capital for each of the property companies shall be determined as of the closing date in accordance with the procedure set forth below, and the cash portion of the contribution amount shall be adjusted up or down in accordance with such determination. at least two (2) business days prior to the closing, each property company and the partnerships in good faith shall prepare an unaudited estimated balance sheet of such property company as of the closing date (the "estimated closing balance sheet") and an estimate of the net working capital of the property company as of the close of business on the closing date (the "estimated closing net working capital") based on the property company's books and records and other information then available. for purposes of the determination of estimated net working capital, all of the guest room revenue and applicable tax for the night preceding the closing date shall be treated as accounts receivable of such property company for the day preceding the closing date, but the starwood parties shall receive a credit in the determination of net working capital equal to one-half (1/2) 15 of the amount of such accounts receivable for guest room revenue and applicable tax for the night preceding the closing date. (b) adjustment. if the estimated closing net working capital for any property company is greater than zero, the cash portion of the contribution amount allocated to the property company interests in such property company shall be adjusted upwards by such excess. if estimated closing net working capital for any property company is less than zero, the cash portion of the contribution amount allocated to the property company interest in such property company shall be adjusted downwards by such shortfall until the cash portion is zero, and thereafter the number of op units included in the portion of the contribution amount allocated to property company interests in such property company shall be reduced based upon the closing value, until such shortfall is fully offset. (c) final closing balance sheet. as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after closing, the partnerships will cause hei to deliver to the contributing parties a balance sheet of each of the property companies as of the closing (the "closing balance sheet") prepared by hei on a basis consistent with the most recent balance sheet on the financial statements for such property company, which closing balance sheet will reflect the hei's determination (as certified by the chief financial officer of hei) of the net working capital as of the close of business on the closing date (the "closing net working capital") of such property company. (d) independent auditor. (i) if the contributing parties disagree with hei's determination of closing net working capital, the contributing parties shall notify the partnerships in writing of such disagreement (such notice setting forth the basis for such disagreement in reasonable detail) and the partnerships and the contributing parties thereafter shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreements. if the partnerships and the contributing parties are unable to resolve any such disagreements within thirty (30) days after the partnerships cause hei to deliver the closing balance sheet to the contributing parties, the partnerships and the contributing parties shall subject the dispute to a "big six" public accounting firm jointly selected by the partnerships and the contributing parties (the "independent auditor") for resolution. if the partnerships and the contributing, parties are unable to agree upon an independent auditor, the independent auditor shall be selected by lot from a list of four "big six" accounting firms (of which two firms shall be selected by each of the partnerships and the contributing parties, but excluding any firm which has previously audited such property company's or any of the starwood parties' financial statements). (ii) the partnerships and the contributing parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the independent auditor to resolve all disagreements over the closing net working capital as soon as 16 practicable, but in any event within 60 days after submission of the disputes to the independent auditor. the resolution of such disagreements and the determination of closing net working capital by the independent auditor shall be final and binding on the partnerships and the contributing parties. (iii) the independent auditor will determine the allocation of its costs and expenses in determining the closing net working capital based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. for example, if the contributing parties claim the closing net working capital is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the partnership's accountants, and the partnerships contest only $500 of the amount claimed by the contributing parties, and if the independent auditor ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the contributing parties $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 500) to the partnerships and 40% (i.e., 200 500) to the contributing parties. (e) final adjustment. if the closing net working capital for any property company (as finally determined pursuant to section 4.01(c) or (d), as applicable) is greater than the estimated closing net working capital, the partnerships shall, within three (3) business days after the closing net working capital is so finally determined, pay to the contributing parties owning property company interests in such property company in immediately available funds, the difference between the closing net working capital and the estimated closing net working capital. if the closing net working capital for such property company is less than the estimated closing net working capital for such property company, the contributing parties owning property company interests in such property company shall, within three (3) business days after the closing net working capital for such property company is so finally determined, pay to the partnerships, in immediately available funds, the difference between closing net working capital and estimated closing net working capital for such property company. all amounts owed pursuant to this section 4.01 (e) shall include interest thereon, from and excluding the day which is fifteen (15) days after the date on which the party entitled to receive such amount makes written demand for its payment to and including the date of payment, at the "prime" rate as announced by chase manhattan bank n.a. on the date on which such demand is made calculated on the basis of a 365-day year. all determinations pursuant to this section 4.01(e) shall be made in accordance with gaap. 4.2 errors. notwithstanding the foregoing and in addition to the provisions of subsections 4.01(a) - (e), if at any time within one year following closing either party discovers any items which should have been included in the net working capital adjustments but which were omitted therefrom, or any error in the computation of such adjustments, or any items not previously capable of determination, such items or error shall be properly adjusted as of closing without interest thereon. 17 article v [reserved] article vi risk of loss 6.1 risk of loss. subject to the following provisions of this article vi, the contributing parties shall bear all risk of all loss or damage to the property from all causes until closing. 6.2 casualty. if one or more of the hotels is materially damaged by any fire or other casualty prior to closing, the property company owning such damaged hotel will immediately notify the partnerships in writing of the same (a "casualty notice"). the casualty notice will include a reasonably detailed description of the property damage and such property company's best estimate of the cost and time required to repair such damage. the cost of repairing such damage to any hotel as estimated by an architect or other qualified consultant retained by such property company is herein referred to as a "casualty loss" with respect to such hotel. 6.3 eminent domain. in the event that a portion of one or more of the hotels are taken by eminent domain or becomes subject to a taking by eminent domain or a deed in lieu of condemnation prior to closing, the affected property company will immediately notify the partnerships in writing, of the same (a "eminent domain notice"). the reasonably estimated value of the portion of any hotel taken or subject to taking by eminent domain is herein referred to as a "condemnation loss" with respect to such hotel. 6.4 elections upon casualty or eminent domain. if any of the events described in section 6.02 or section 6.03 occurs prior to closing, then the provisions of this section 6.04 shall apply: (a) minor loss. subject to section 6.04(c) below, if the amount of the casualty loss or the condemnation loss, as applicable (the "loss"), to any hotel is equal to or less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), then the partnerships shall receive a credit to the cash portion of the contribution amount equal to the adjustment amount (as defined in section 6.05), and in such event the closing will be as otherwise provided herein with respect to the property company interests and contributed assets of the property company which owns the hotel subject to such loss.

(c) major casualty damage. if the aggregate amount of the loss with respect to any hotel is greater than five million dollars ($5,000,000), or if three or more hotels each have a loss in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000), then the partnerships must elect (as their sole and exclusive remedy) either: (i) to proceed in accordance with section 6.04(b) above; or (ii) to terminate this agreement by giving notice to such effect to the contributing parties not later than the loss election date. in the event of such termination, then the entire amount of the deposit will be refunded to slt. the partnerships' failure to give timely notice under this section 6.04(c) will be deemed to be an election under clause (ii) of this section 6.04(c). 6.5 adjustment amount. as used in this article vi, "adjustment amount" means the sum of (i) in the case of casualty damage covered by a property company's property casualty insurance, the amount of the deductible under such insurance policy with respect to such casualty damage (not to exceed the amount of such casualty damage), plus (ii) any amounts previously paid to such property company as insurance or condemnation proceeds, as applicable, and not expended by such property company prior to closing for the purpose for which received (including but not limited to expenditures for restoration of the affected hotel in connection with such casualty or condemnation); provided, however, that in determining the adjustments to be made to the cash portion of the contribution amount at closing for the adjustment amount (in accordance with this article vi) and for net working capital (in accordance with article iv), appropriate adjustment shall be made so as to not double count as current assets of a property company any unexpended amounts received by a property company as insurance or condemnation proceeds or the right of a property company to receive any insurance or condemnation proceeds, and so as to not double count as current liabilities of such property company any liabilities of a property company for which such insurance or condemnation proceeds have been or will be payable. 19 article vii representations and warranties 7.1 contributing party's representation and warranties. to induce the starwood parties to enter into this agreement each contributing party makes the following representations and warranties on behalf of such contributing party, and on behalf of or with respect to the property company in which such contributing party owns property company interests all of which (i) are now true, and (ii) except as expressly provided herein to the contrary, shall be true as of closing, subject, in each case, to the exceptions set forth on the schedules attached to this agreement and on any supplemental schedules thereof as may be delivered to the starwood parties prior to the closing, provided, however, that: (1) prior to closing, the remedies of the starwood properties for any breach of such representations and warranties shall be limited in accordance with section 13.02(a); (2) an election by the starwood parties to complete closing notwithstanding knowledge of any breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of such breach in accordance with section 12.05(b); and (3) after closing, the liability of the contributing parties for any breach of such representations and warranties shall be limited in accordance with section 14.02(b). subject to the foregoing, the contributing parties represent and warrant as follows: (a) subsidiaries and investments. the property company has no subsidiaries and does not own, directly or indirectly, any stock, membership interests, partnership interests or joint venture interests in, or similar equity ownership interest issued by, any other person.

(a) if a party hereto seeks indemnification under this article xiv such party (the "indemnified party") shall give written notice to the other party (the "indemnifying party") of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim. in that regard, if any suit, action, claim, liability or obligations shall be brought or asserted by any third party which, if adversely determined, would entitle the indemnified party to indemnity pursuant to this article xiv, the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party of the same in writing, specifying in detail the basis of such claim and the facts pertaining thereto and the indemnifying party, if it so elects, shall assume and control the defense thereof (and shall consult with the indemnified party with respect thereto), including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all necessary expenses; provided that the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume control of such defense if the claim which the indemnifying party seeks to assume control (1) seeks non-monetary relief; or (2) involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations. in the event that the indemnified party retains control of the defense of such claim, the indemnified party shall use good faith efforts, consistent with prudent business judgment, to defend such claim. if the indemnifying party is permitted to assume and control the defense and elects to do so, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the indemnifying party in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the indemnified party shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (a) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party in writing, (b) the indemnifying party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and such counsel advises the indemnifying party of the general nature of such conflict, (c) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel, or (d) the indemnified party has reasonably determined that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on its business, reputation or could reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse precedential effect; in which case the fees and expenses of the indemnified party's counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without the written consent of the indemnifying party, however, if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such judgment. (b) in the event any indemnified party which is an individual, or any senior officer (including, without limitation, any president or vice-president) of any other indemnified party or any general partner or member thereof, has actual knowledge of any valid claim or 51 defense (and not merely any facts or circumstances which may give rise to such claim or defense) against a third party who is a party to the applicable claim in connection with any loss as to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification pursuant to this article xiv and such indemnified party without good reason fails to notify the indemnifying party of such claim or defense or without good reason fails to assert such claim or defense on its own behalf, then the indemnified party shall not be entitled to receive indemnification from the indemnifying party to the extent of the loss which is proven by the indemnifying party to have been occasioned by such failure to notify or such failure to assert such claim or defense. the determination of whether a party had "good reason" for failure to notify or failure to assert any claim or defense shall be made by the arbitrator pursuant to subsection (i) below. (c) in the event any indemnified party is insured pursuant to an unexpired insurance policy against any occurrence giving rise to any loss as to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification pursuant to this article xiv (including, without limitation, pursuant to any insurance policy maintained by any property company before or after closing), the indemnified party shall promptly give notice of such insurance coverage to the indemnifying party and the indemnifying party shall, in its reasonable discretion, elect either (i) to require the indemnified party to make a claim pursuant to such insurance policy for such loss and the indemnifying party's obligation to indemnify the indemnified party shall thereafter be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds received by the indemnified party as a result of such claim or (ii) to indemnify the indemnified party without requiring a claim to be made by the indemnified party on such insurance policy. in the event the indemnifying party elects to require the indemnified party to make a claim on such insurance policy pursuant to clause (i) above, the indemnifying party shall pay any increase in insurance premiums resulting directly and proximately from such claim by the indemnified party on such insurance policy; provided that if any such increase in such insurance premium is caused by one or more claims on such insurance policy as a result of losses which are not subject to indemnification pursuant to this article xiv, then the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay such increase in insurance premiums only to the extent such increase is attributable to claims made by the indemnified party pursuant to clause (i) above. the determination of the amount of such increase in insurance premiums attributable to any claim made pursuant to clause (i) above shall be made by the mutual agreement of the parties acting in good faith, and in the event the parties are unable to so agree shall be made by the arbitrator pursuant to subsection (i) below. the indemnified party shall provide to the indemnifying party such documentation relating to such increase in insurance premium as shall be necessary to establish the amount of such increase and shall otherwise cooperate with the indemnifying party in establishing the amount of such increase attributable to the claim made pursuant to clause (i) above. (d) in the event that the starwood parties are entitled to any indemnification hereunder from the contributing parties, within 15 days after a final determination of the amount of such indemnification pursuant to the terms of this article xiv (the "indemnification amounts"), the contributing parties shall make an election to pay (and shall pay) such indemnification amount either (i) by payment of immediately available funds to the starwood parties or (ii) by delivering or causing the partnerships to cancel on their respective books and records an equal number of slt op units and slc op units held by the contributing parties having a current market value (based upon the paired share price as of the date of the final determination of such indemnification amount) equal to the indemnification amount, and to the 52 extent such delivery or cancellation of slt op units and slc op units is insufficient to pay such indemnification amount, immediately available funds for the remaining balance of such indemnification amount. in the event that the contributing parties are entitled to any indemnification hereunder from the starwood parties, within 15 days after a final determination of the amount of such indemnification pursuant to the terms of this article xiv, the starwood parties shall satisfy such obligation by payment of immediately available funds to the contributing parties. (e) any dispute, controversy, or claim arising under or relating to this article xiv ("dispute") shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration administered by the american arbitration association ("aaa") under its commercial arbitration rules, subject to the following: (i) either party may demand that any dispute be submitted to binding arbitration. the demand for arbitration shall be in writing, shall be served on the other party in the manner prescribed herein for the giving of notices, and shall set forth a short statement of the factual basis for the claim, specifying the matter or matters to be arbitrated. (ii) the arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator appointed by the aaa (the "arbitrator") who shall conduct such evidentiary or other hearings as such arbitrator deems necessary or appropriate and thereafter shall make a final determination as soon as practicable. any arbitration pursuant hereto shall be conducted by the arbitrator as the parties may mutually agree or, if the parties do not so agree, under the guidance of the federal rules of civil procedure and the federal rules of evidence, but the arbitrator shall not be required to comply strictly with such rules in conducting any such arbitration. all such arbitration proceedings shall take place in new york, new york. (iii) except as provided herein: (a) each party shall bear its own "costs and fees," which are defined as all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses (including but not limited to, copying and telephone) witness fees, and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses; (b) the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration ("arbitration expenses") shall be borne equally by the parties; and (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator shall be empowered to require any one or more of the parties to bear all or any portion of such costs and fees and/or the fees and expenses of the arbitrator in the event that the arbitrator determines such party has acted unreasonably or in bad faith. (iv) the arbitrator shall have the authority to award damages, including costs but shall not have the authority to award punitive damages, to impose sanctions for 53 abuse or frustration of the arbitration process, or to compel specific performance. the decision of the arbitrator and any award pursuant thereto shall be in writing and counterpart copies thereof shall be delivered to each party. the decision and award of the arbitrator shall be binding on all parties. in rendering such decision and award, the arbitrator shall not add to, subtract from or otherwise modify the provisions of this article xiv. either party to the arbitration may seek to have judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. (v) each party agrees that it will not file any suit, motion, petition or otherwise commence any legal action or proceeding for any matter which is required to be submitted to arbitration as contemplated herein except in connection with the enforcement of an award rendered by the arbitrator and except to seek non-monetary equitable relief including, with limitation, the issuance of an injunction or temporary restraining order pending a final determination by the arbitrator. upon the entry of any order dismissing or staying any action or proceeding filed contrary to the preceding sentence, the party which filed such action or proceeding shall promptly pay to the other party the reasonable attorney's fees, costs and expenses incurred by such other party prior to the entry of such order. (vi) all aspects of the arbitration shall be considered confidential and shall not be disseminated by any party with the exception of the ability and opportunity to prosecute its claim or assert its defense to any such claim. the arbitrator shall be required to issue prescriptive orders as may be required to enforce and maintain this covenant of confidentiality during the course of the arbitration and after the conclusion of same so that the result and the underlying data, information, materials and other evidence are forever withheld from public dissemination with the exception of its subpoena by a court of competence jurisdiction in an unrelated proceeding brought by a third party.

provided, however, that each person so selected shall be acceptable to the trust and the corporation. 2.10. whenever the trust and the corporation shall effect a registration pursuant to this section 2 in connection with an underwritten offering by one or more selling holders of registrable securities: (i) if such selling holders have requested the inclusion therein of more than one class of registrable securities and the underwriters' representative advises the selling holders that, in its opinion, the inclusion of more than one class of registrable securities would adversely affect such offering, the majority selling holders shall decide which class of registrable securities shall be included therein in such offering and the related registration and the other class shall be excluded and (ii) if the underwriters' representative advises the selling holders that, in its opinion, the amount of securities requested to be included in such offering (whether by selling holders or others, including the trust and the corporation) exceeds the amount which can be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to the majority selling holders, securities shall be included in such offering and the related registration, to the extent of the amount which can be sold within such price range in the following order of priority: first, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration pursuant to this section 2, pro rata based on the estimated gross proceeds from the sale thereof;

provided, however, that such right of inclusion shall not apply to any registration statement covering an offering of debt securities or convertible debt securities (any such registration in which holders participate pursuant to this section 3.1 being referred to as a "piggyback registration"). the trust and the corporation shall have the absolute right to delay, withdraw or cease to prepare or file any registration statement for any offering referred to in this section 3 without any obligation or liability to any holder, it being understood that any registrable securities previously included in any such withdrawn registration statement shall not cease to be registrable securities by reason of such inclusion or withdrawal. any holder of registrable securities who has requested inclusion of such securities in a piggyback registration may withdraw therefrom by written notice to the trust, the corporation and the underwriter and the other selling holders, provided such withdrawal is made prior to the effective date of the relevant registration statement. 3.2. if the underwriters' representative shall advise the trust and the corporation that, in its opinion, the amount or type of registrable securities requested to be included in a piggyback registration would adversely affect such offering, or the timing thereof, then the trust and the corporation will include in such registration, to the extent of the amount and class which the trust and the corporation are so advised can be sold without such adverse effect in such offering: first, all securities, if any, requested to be included in a registration statement pursuant to the exercise of demand registration rights granted by the trust and the corporation;

provided, however, that neither the trust nor the corporation shall be required to incur any material out-of-pocket expense pursuant to this sentence and; provided, further, that the officers of the trust and the corporation will not be required to participate in more than one "roadshow" in any twelve month period. 4.6. promptly notify each selling holder of any stop order issued or threatened to be issued by the commission in connection therewith and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered. 4.7. make available for inspection by any selling holder, any underwriter participating in such offering and the representatives of such selling holder and underwriter (but not more than one firm of counsel to such selling holders), all financial and other information as shall be reasonably requested by them, and provide any selling holder, any underwriter participating in such offering and the representatives of such selling holder and underwriter the reasonable opportunity to discuss the business affairs of the trust and the corporation with their principal executives and independent public accountants who have certified the audited financial statements included in such registration statement, in each case all as necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility under the securities act; provided, however, that information that the trust or the corporation determine to be confidential and which the trust or the corporation advise such person in writing, is confidential shall not be disclosed unless such person signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to the trust and the corporation or the related selling holder of registrable securities agrees to be responsible for such person's breach of confidentiality on terms reasonably satisfactory to the trust and the corporation. 4.8. use their respective reasonable efforts to obtain a so-called "comfort letter" from the independent public accountants of the trust and the corporation, and legal opinions of counsel to the trust and the corporation addressed to the selling holders, in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by such letters, and in a form that shall be reasonably satisfactory to the majority selling holders. delivery of any such opinion or comfort letter shall be subject to the recipient furnishing such written representations or acknowledgments as are customarily provided by selling shareholders who receive such comfort letters or opinions. 4.9. use their respective reasonable efforts to cause the registrable securities covered by such registration statement (i) if the paired shares are then listed on a securities exchange or included for quotation in a recognized trading market, to continue to be so listed or included for a reasonable period of time after the offering, and (ii) to be registered with or approved by such other united states or state governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the trust and the corporation to enable the selling holders of registrable securities to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities. 4.10. take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of registrable securities included in each such registration. section 5. holders' obligations. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the trust and the corporation to take any action pursuant to this agreement with respect to the registrable securities of any selling holder of registrable securities that such selling holder shall: 5.1. furnish to the trust and the corporation such information regarding such selling holder, the number of the registrable securities owned by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of such selling holder's registrable securities, and to cooperate fully with the trust and the corporation in preparing such registration. 5.2. except as set forth in sections 2.10 and 3.1, agree to sell their registrable securities to the underwriters at the same price and on substantially the same terms and conditions as the trust and the corporation or the other persons on whose behalf the registration statement was being filed have agreed to sell their securities, and to execute the underwriting agreement agreed to by the majority selling holders (in the case of a registration under section 2) or the trust and the corporation and the majority selling holders (in the case of a registration under section 3). section 6. expenses of registration. expenses in connection with registrations pursuant to this agreement shall be allocated and paid as follows: 6.1. with respect to each demand registration, shelf registration and tender registration, each of the trust and the corporation shall bear and pay all expenses incurred in connection with any registration, filing, or qualification of registrable securities with respect to such registration for each selling holder, including all registration, filing and national association of securities dealers, inc. fees, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws, all printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the trust and the corporation, and of the independent public accountants for the trust and the corporation, including the expenses of "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance (the "registration expenses"), but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions relating to registrable securities (which shall be paid on a pro rata basis by the selling holders) and all fees and expenses of counsel for the selling holders; provided, however, that the trust and the corporation shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to section 2 if the registration is subsequently withdrawn as a result of the failure of the selling holders to satisfy their obligations under this agreement (in which case the selling holders that fail to satisfy their obligations under this agreement shall bear such expenses), unless, in the case of a demand registration or a shelf registration, holders whose registrable securities constitute a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding agree that such withdrawn registration shall have constituted one of the demand or shelf registrations available to them under section 2 hereof. the trust and the corporation each agree between themselves that they shall bear and pay registration expenses in an amount equal to their respective issuance percentage of such registration expenses and that they shall reimburse each other to the extent necessary to cause each of them to so bear and pay such respective amounts. 6.2. the trust and the corporation shall bear and pay all registration expenses incurred in connection with any piggyback registrations pursuant to section 3, but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions relating to registrable securities (which shall be paid on a pro rata basis by the selling holders) and all fees and expenses of counsel for the selling holders. section 7. indemnification; contribution. if any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under this agreement: 7.1. to the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the trust and the corporation, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless each selling holder, each person, if any, who controls such selling holder within the meaning of the securities act, and each officer, director, partner and employee of such selling holder and such controlling person, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (joint or several), including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and reasonable expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to which any of the foregoing persons may otherwise become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendments or supplements thereto; or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the indemnification required by this section 7.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of the trust or the corporation (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the trust or the corporation be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the trust or the corporation by the indemnified party in writing expressly for use in connection with such registration; and provided, further, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 7 shall not apply to the extent that any such loss is based on or arises out of an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or an omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, contained in or omitted from any preliminary prospectus if the final prospectus shall correct such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or such omission or alleged omission, and a copy of the final prospectus has not been sent or given to such person at or prior to the confirmation of sale to such person if an underwriter or selling holder was under an obligation to deliver such final prospectus and failed to do so. 7.2. to the extent permitted by applicable law, each selling holder shall indemnify and hold harmless the trust, the corporation, each of the trustees of the trust, each of the directors of the corporation, each of the officers of the trust or the corporation who shall have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the trust or the corporation within the meaning of the securities act, any other selling holder, any controlling person of any such other selling holder and each officer, director, partner, and employee of such other selling holder and such controlling person, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (joint and several), including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and reasonable expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to which any of the foregoing persons may otherwise become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state laws, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent that such violation arises out of or is based upon information furnished by such selling holder in writing expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided, however, that (x) the indemnification required by this section 7.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of the relevant selling holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (y) in no event shall the amount of any indemnity under this section 7.2 exceed the gross proceeds from the applicable offering received by such selling holder. 7.3. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may make a claim under this section 7, such indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and disbursements and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time following the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 7 to the extent of such prejudice but shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than pursuant to this section 7. any fees and expenses incurred by the indemnified party (including any fees and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or proceeding) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within thirty (30) days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). any such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expenses of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to promptly assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding or (iii) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party and that the assertion of such defenses would create a conflict of interest such that counsel employed by the indemnifying party could not faithfully represent the indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action, claim or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, unless in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such action, claim or proceeding, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels). 7.4. if the indemnification required by this section 7 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in this section 7: (i) the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any violation has been committed by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such violation. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 7.1 and section 7.2, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (ii) the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in section 7.4(i). no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 7.5. if indemnification is available under this section 7, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in this section 7 without regard to the relative fault of such indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration referred to in section 7.4. 7.6. the obligations of the trust, the corporation and the selling holders of registrable securities under this section 7 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement under this agreement, and otherwise. section 8. holdback. (a) each holder, if so requested by the underwriters' representative in connection with an offering of any securities covered by a registration statement filed by trust and the corporation, whether or not holder's securities are included therein, shall not effect any public sale or distribution of paired shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for paired shares, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act (except as part of such underwritten registration), during the 15-day period prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the date such registration statement is declared effective under the securities act by the commission. in order to enforce the foregoing covenant, the trust and the corporation shall be entitled to impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the registrable securities of each holder until the end of such period. holders of registrable securities shall have the right to participate in any such registration on the terms provided in section 3 hereof. (b) each of the trust and the corporation agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the 15-day period prior to and during the 90-day period beginning on the effective date of any underwritten demand registration (except pursuant to (i) registrations on form s-8 or any successor form, (ii) registrations on form s-4 or any successor form and (iii) registrations of securities in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan on form(s) applicable to such securities) unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering otherwise agree. section 9. amendment, modification and waivers; further assurances. (i) this agreement may be amended with the consent of the trust and the corporation and the trust and the corporation may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the trust and the corporation shall have obtained the written consent of the required holders to such amendment, action or omission to act and no consent or agreement of any holder shall be required for such amendment, action or omission to act. (ii) no waiver of any terms or conditions of this agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other breach of such terms and conditions or any other term or condition, nor shall any failure to enforce any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any other provision hereof. no written waiver hereunder, unless it by its own terms explicitly provides to the contrary, shall be construed to effect a continuing waiver of the provisions being waived and no such waiver in any instance shall constitute a waiver in any other instance or for any other purpose or impair the right of the party against whom such waiver is claimed in all other instances or for all other purposes to require full compliance with such provision. (iii) each of the parties hereto shall execute all such further instruments and documents and take all such further action as any other party hereto may reasonably require in order to effectuate the terms and purposes of this agreement. section 10. assignment; benefit. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. in addition, and whether or not any express assignment shall have been made, the provisions of this agreement which are for the benefit of the parties hereto other than the corporation and the trust, shall also be for the benefit of and enforceable by any subsequent holder of any registrable securities, subject to all the provisions herein, including those respecting the minimum numbers or percentages of shares of registrable securities required in order to be entitled to certain rights, or take certain actions, contained herein. section 11. condition precedent to paired share election and combined election under the exchange rights agreement. the (i) trust and the corporation, individually and as the general partners of the realty partnership and the operating partnership, respectively and (ii) the realty partnership and the operating partnership, acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything in the exchange rights agreement to the contrary, the rights of the trust or the corporation under the exchange rights agreement to issue paired shares pursuant to a paired share election or combined election (each as defined in the exchange rights agreement) shall be conditioned upon the paired shares issued in exchange for tendered units having been registered pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective by the commission under the securities act. in the event that such registration statement has not been declared effective by the commission as of the date of issuance of the paired shares pursuant to such paired share or combined election, the tender date shall be extended until the date on which such registration statement has been so declared effective; provided that, if such registration statement has not been declared effective within sixty (60) days following the delivery of the letter of transmittal (as defined in the exchange rights agreement), such letter of transmittal may be withdrawn in the sole discretion of the tendering holder of units. section 12. miscellaneous. 12.1. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york, without giving regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. 12.2. notices. all notices and requests given pursuant to this agreement shall be in writing and shall be made by hand-delivery, first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), confirmed facsimile or overnight air courier guaranteeing next business day delivery to the relevant address specified in the unit contribution agreement or class a contribution agreement, as the case may be. except as otherwise provided in this agreement, the date of each such notice and request shall be deemed to be, and the date on which each such notice and request shall be deemed given shall be: at the time delivered, if personally delivered or mailed; when receipt is acknowledged, if sent by facsimile; and the next business day after timely delivery to the courier, if sent by overnight air courier guaranteeing next business day delivery. 12.3. entire agreement; integration. this agreement supersedes all prior agreements between or among any of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and such agreements embody the entire understanding among the parties relating to such subject matter. 12.4. section headings. section headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning of any provision of this agreement. 12.5. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, and all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. all signatures need not be on the same counterpart. 12.6. severability. if any provision of this agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this agreement, unless the result thereof would be unreasonable, in which case the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith as to appropriate amendments hereto. 12.7. termination. this agreement may be terminated at any time by a written instrument signed by the trust, the corporation and the unanimous consent of the holders. unless sooner terminated in accordance with the preceding sentence, this agreement (other than section 7 hereof) shall terminate in its entirety on such date as there shall be (a) no registrable securities outstanding, and (b) no securities outstanding which are convertible or exchangeable into registrable securities; provided that any paired shares previously subject to this agreement shall not be registrable securities following the sale of any such shares in an offering registered pursuant to this agreement. 12.8. starwood lodging trust. the parties hereto understand and agree that the name "starwood lodging trust" is a designation of the trust and its trustees (as trustees but not personally) under the declaration of trust, and all persons dealing with the trust shall look solely to the trust's assets for the enforcement of any claims against the trust, and that the trustees, officers, agents and security holders of the trust assume no personal liability for obligations entered into on behalf of the trust, and their respective individual assets shall not be subject to the claims of any person relating to such obligations. 12.9. other registration rights. without the prior written consent of the required holders (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the trust and the corporation will not in the future grant directly or indirectly to any persons the right to request the trust and the corporation to register any equity securities of the trust and the corporation, or any securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for such securities if such grant conflicts with the rights of priority granted to the holders pursuant to section 2.10. 12.10. submission to jurisdiction. each of the parties hereto and each of the holders irrevocably submits and consents to the jurisdiction of the united states district court for the southern district of new york in connection with any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement, and irrevocably waives any immunity from jurisdiction thereof and any claim of improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar basis to which it might otherwise be entitled in any such action or proceeding. 12.11. specific performance. each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this agreement, the non-breaching party or parties would be irreparably harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. the parties hereby agree that in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, they shall be entitled to compel specific performance of this agreement in any action instituted in any court of the united states or any state thereof having subject matter jurisdiction for such action. in witness whereof, this agreement has been duly

corporation, starwood partners and other parties (i) on the date hereof the starwood partners are making capital contributions to the realty partnership in return for the issuance by the realty

issued by the realty partnership to the starwood partners on the date hereof, together with any units of the realty partnership issued to the starwood partners after the date hereof, being hereinafter

(a) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, each holder of starwood units (as defined below) shall have the right to tender to the trust outstanding realty units and the right to tender to the corporation outstanding operating units. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement (i) no realty unit may be tendered to the trust unless simultaneously therewith the tendering holder also tenders to the corporation an operating unit and no operating unit may be tendered to the corporation unless simultaneously therewith the tendering holder also tenders to the trust a realty unit (a realty unit tendered for exchange and the operating unit simultaneously tendered for exchange being hereinafter collectively referred to as a "starwood unit") and (ii) any attempted tender of a realty unit or an operating unit which is not accompanied by a simultaneous tender of an operating unit or realty unit, respectively, shall be void and of no effect; it being understood that a simultaneous tender of unequal numbers of realty units and operating units shall be valid under this sentence to the extent of the lesser of the number of realty units or operating units, as the case may be, included in such tender. (b) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, no paired shares or cash shall be issued or paid in respect of any tender of starwood units (i) if, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6 of this agreement, the right to tender starwood units and receive paired shares or cash would result in the trust not satisfying the reit requirements in any respect or would result in any person or entity beneficially owning trust shares exceeding the ownership limit, (ii) if, with respect to all starwood partners other than prudential property investment separate account ii, the tender pursuant to section 1(a) is prior to the first anniversary of the date of this agreement, (iii) prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to such exchange and issuance, if any, under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as it may be amended from time to time, or (iv) prior to the receipt of all governmental and regulatory approvals which are required to be obtained prior to such tender and issuance or payment, including, without limitation, any required approvals of the gaming authorities of the state of nevada and of clark county, nevada (the "gaming approvals"). prior to the receipt of gaming approvals, such holder shall, as a condition to any tender of starwood units which would (if the paired share option (as defined below) were to be elected in respect of such tender) cause such holder to beneficially own, in the aggregate, paired shares representing more than 4.9% of the then issued and outstanding paired shares, give not less than 90 days' written notice to the trust and the corporation (at the offices provided pursuant to section 10) of its intent to tender starwood units; provided, however, that the ownership by prudential property investment separate account ii of paired shares as contemplated by the penultimate sentence of section 8.02(j) of the contribution agreement shall not require any such written notice to the trust and corporation. in the event that the ability to receive paired shares or cash would result in the trust not satisfying the reit requirements in any respect or would result in any person or entity beneficially owning trust shares exceeding the ownership limit, and as a result thereof no paired shares or cash may be issued or paid in respect of any tender of starwood units pursuant to section 1(b)(i) above, the parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts to restructure the terms and provisions of this agreement (and, if necessary, the partnership agreements and the registration rights agreement (as defined in section 6)), or to agree to terms and provisions in addition to such terms and provisions, so as to provide to each such party the same substantive rights (or substantive rights as close thereto as is reasonably practicable) as those provided by this agreement, the partnership agreements and the registration rights agreement. (c) the rights to exchange starwood units pursuant to this agreement constitute a continuous offer and may not be withdrawn, amended or modified by the trust or the corporation without the prior written consent of each holder of outstanding starwood units adversely affected by such withdrawal, amendment or modification; provided that any withdrawal, amendment or modification that does not adversely affect any holder of outstanding starwood units may be effected without the consent of such holder. section 2. acceptance of tender; election of method of payment for tendered starwood units. (a) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, the trust and the corporation shall accept starwood units validly tendered in proper form and meeting all of the requirements of this agreement. in order for starwood units to be validly tendered pursuant to this agreement, the registered holder thereof shall deliver to the trust and the corporation, at the address provided pursuant to section 10, (i) a completed and duly executed letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as exhibit a (the "letter of transmittal") and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal and (ii) a calculation, to the best knowledge of such registered holder after due inquiry (together with such supporting documentation as the trust may reasonably request), of the maximum number of paired shares that may be issued to such registered holder without causing either (x) the trust to not satisfy the reit requirements in any respect or (y) any person or entity to beneficially own trust shares exceeding the ownership limit. the trust and the corporation shall make all determinations as to the validity and form of any tender of starwood units in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and upon rejection of a tender shall give the tendering holder written notice of such rejection, which shall include the reasons therefor. (b) unless otherwise determined by agreement of the trust and the corporation, tenders of starwood units pursuant to this agreement shall be irrevocable and shall not be subject to withdrawal or modification; provided that if the trust and the corporation make the paired share election with respect to a tender, then within 5 days after such election the tendering holder may elect to revoke such tender so long as (i) no public disclosure of such tender has been made prior to such revocation and (ii) such tendering holder reimburses the trust and the corporation for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such tender. (c) within 15 days after the valid tender pursuant to this agreement of starwood units, the trust and the corporation shall make an election to pay for such starwood units by delivering either (i) paired shares (the "paired share election"), (ii) cash (the "cash election") or (iii) a combination of paired shares and cash (the "combined election"). such election shall be made pursuant to an agreement as to such election between the trust and the corporation. if the trust and the corporation do not so agree within such 15-day period, they shall be deemed to have made the cash election. section 3. paired share election. (a) if with respect to any tender of starwood units pursuant to this agreement, the trust and the corporation make the paired share election, then, except as provided in section 2(b), within fifteen days after the expiration of the 5-day period referred to in section 2(b), the trust and the corporation shall deliver to the tendering holder one paired share for each starwood unit validly tendered pursuant to the provisions of this agreement. (b) no fractional paired shares or scrip representing fractional paired shares shall be issued upon exchange of starwood units pursuant to this agreement. if more than one letter of transmittal shall be delivered at one time by the same holder, the number of full paired shares which shall be issuable upon exchange of the starwood units tendered thereby shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of starwood units so tendered. instead of any fractional paired shares which would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of any starwood units, the trust and the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the paired share closing price on the last business day preceding the date of exchange. (c) if a holder exchanges starwood units pursuant to this agreement, the trust and the corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on any issue of paired shares upon such exchange. such holder, however, shall (i) pay to the trust and the corporation the amount of any additional documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax which is due (or shall establish to the satisfaction of the trust and the corporation the payment thereof) as a result of paired shares being issued in a name other than the name of such holder and (ii) be responsible for all income or other taxes as a result of such exchange. section 4. cash election. (a) if with respect to any tender of starwood units pursuant to this agreement, the trust and the corporation make or are deemed to have made the cash election, then within 20 days after such tender the trust and the corporation shall pay to the tendering holder an aggregate amount of cash (the "aggregate cash payment") equal to the product of (i) the number of paired shares which would have been delivered to such holder if the trust and the corporation had made the paired share election with respect to such tender and (ii) the average paired share closing price for the ten trading day period ending one day prior to the date of such tender. (b) in connection with any aggregate cash payment pursuant to section 4(a) or any cash payment pursuant to section 5(a)(ii), the trust shall pay 95% of such aggregate cash payment or such cash payment and the corporation shall pay 5% of such aggregate cash payment or such cash payment (such percentages being herein called the "issuance percentages"); provided that the trust and the corporation may from time to time change the issuance percentages based on their determination of the relative fair values of the trust shares and the corporation shares. section 5. combined election. (a) if with respect to any tender of units pursuant to this agreement, the trust and the corporation shall make the combined election, then, except as provided in section 2(b), within 15 days after the expiration of the 5-day period referred to in section 2(b), the trust and the corporation shall (i) notify the tendering holder of the number of such tendered units which will be exchanged for cash (the "cash units") and the number of such tendered units which will be exchanged for paired shares (the "paired share units"), (ii) pay to the tendering holder, in respect of each cash unit validly tendered pursuant to the provisions of this agreement, an amount of cash (with each of the trust and the corporation paying its then respective issuance percentage of such amount of cash) equal to the average paired share closing price for the ten trading day period ending one day prior to the date of such tender and (iii) deliver to the tendering holder one paired share for each paired share unit validly tendered pursuant to the provisions of this agreement. (b) the provisions of sections 3(b) and 3(c) of this agreement shall apply to the issuance of paired shares pursuant to section 5(a). section 6. registration rights. if at any time after six (6) months from the date of this agreement, (a) a starwood partner validly tenders starwood units pursuant to the provisions of this agreement, (b) the trust and the corporation make the paired share election or the combined election with respect to such tender, (c) as a result of the ownership limit such starwood partner cannot receive the full number of paired shares otherwise issuable to such starwood partner pursuant to such tender and such election (without giving effect to the ownership limit) (the event described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) being referred to as a "paired share tender reduction"; the number of such paired shares which such starwood partner cannot receive pursuant to such tender as a result of the ownership limit being referred to as the "unissued paired shares"; and the starwood units tendered in respect of such unissued paired shares being referred to as the "delayed payment units"), then subject to the other terms and conditions of this agreement, such starwood partner shall be entitled to receive the number of paired shares which it can receive pursuant to such tender, such election and the ownership limit and then, pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the trust and the corporation shall cause there to be filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement and the trust and the corporation shall register and sell pursuant thereto a number of paired shares equal to the number of such unissued paired shares requested by starwood to be registered pursuant to section 2.3 of the registration rights agreement. within two business days after the receipt by the trust and the corporation of the proceeds of any sale (after underwriting discounts and commissions) of such paired shares pursuant to such registration, the trust and the corporation shall pay such proceeds to the tendering holder of the delayed payment units, in full payment for the tender of such delayed payment units. section 7. representations of tendering holder. each tender of starwood units shall constitute a representation and warranty by the tendering holder of each of the representations and warranties set forth in the form of letter of transmittal. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless, at the time of a tender for exchange of starwood units pursuant to this agreement, a registration statement relating to any paired shares to be delivered upon such tender is effective under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), such tender shall constitute a representation and warranty by the tendering holder to the trust and the corporation that such tendering holder (i) is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of rule 501 under the securities act, (ii) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and in investing in entities similar to the partnerships, the trust and the corporation so as to be able to evaluate the risks and merits of its investment in the partnerships, the trust and the corporation and it is able financially to bear the risks thereof, (iii) has had an opportunity to discuss the business, management and financial affairs of the trust, the corporation and the partnerships with the management of the trust, the corporation and the partnerships, and (iv) understands that the paired shares have not been registered under the securities act by reason of their issuance in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act pursuant to section 4(2) thereof or rule 505 or 506 promulgated under the securities act and such paired shares must be held indefinitely unless a subsequent disposition thereof is registered under the securities act and applicable state securities laws or is exempt from such registration. section 8. status of tendering holder. until the holder of starwood units tendered pursuant to this agreement becomes a holder of record of the paired shares issued in exchange therefor (in the case of a paired share election or a combined election) or until such holder has received cash in exchange therefor (in the case of a cash election or a combined election), such holder shall continue to hold and own such starwood units for all purposes of the realty partnership agreement and the operating partnership agreement. in the case of a paired share election or a combined election, no such holder shall have any rights as a shareholder of the trust or a stockholder of the corporation in respect of such paired shares until such holder becomes a holder of record of such paired shares. section 9. reservation of shares; closing of transfer books.

of loss for the account) of the undersigned, be sold to pay such amounts. back-up withholding is not an additional tax. rather, the tax liability of persons subject to back-up withholding will be
