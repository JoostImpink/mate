(a) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; form s-1 demand .&#160; if at any time after the earlier of (i) three (3) years after the date of this agreement or (ii) one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of the registration statement for the ipo, the company receives a request from holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding that the company file a form s-1 registration statement with respect to the registrable securities then outstanding, then the company shall (i) within ten (10) days after the date such request is given, give notice thereof (the &#147; demand notice &#148;) to all holders other than the initiating holders; and (ii) as soon as practicable, and in any event within sixty (60) days after the date such request is given by the initiating holders, file a form s-1 registration statement under the securities act covering all registrable securities that the initiating holders requested to be registered and any additional registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by any other holders, as specified by notice given by each such holder to the company within fourteen (14) days of the date the demand notice is given, and in each case, subject to the limitations of section 2.1(c) and section 2.3 .
