if a trigger event occurs, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a revised applicable premium percentage that shall become effective immediately and shall not be lower than the benchmark fee rate for the previous fiscal year.&#160;

final and binding until a new applicable premium percentage with respect to the next calculation date is determined pursuant to this section 4.20. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (ii) &#160; &#160; &#160; in the event such revised applicable premium percentage is not acceptable to corpbanca, then corpbanca shall hire another benchmarking expert selected by corpbanca from those listed in schedule 4.20(a) to conduct market research for the same purposes described in item (i) above and, based on such research, determine (with instructions to make such determination within thirty (30) days of such benchmarking expert's selection) the insurance fees market average and whether a trigger event has occurred. if the difference between the insurance fees market average determined pursuant to such procedure is lower than ten percent (10%), the simple average between the insurance fees market averages as determined by both benchmarking experts, and the calculation of whether a trigger event has occurred based on such determination, shall be final and binding until a new applicable premium percentage with respect to the next calculation date is determined pursuant to this 50 section 4.20.&#160; if the difference between the insurance fees market averages determined pursuant to such procedure is higher than ten percent (10%), corpbanca may hire an actuary firm from those listed in schedule 4.20(b) to determine (with instructions to make such determination within thirty (30) days of such firm's selection) the insurance fees market average and whether a trigger event has occurred, which determination shall be final and binding until a new applicable premium percentage with respect to the next calculation date is determined pursuant to this section 4.20. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (c) &#160; if ita&#250; parent desires not to continue to cause ita&#250; insurance company to offer the ita&#250; insurance products to corpbanca insurance clients, ita&#250;

insurance products to the corpbanca insurance clients and pay to such corpbanca insurance brokers the related insurance brokerage fees on substantially the same terms set forth in section 4.20(a) and (b); and (ii) until a new insurance contract is effective, continue to pay corpbanca or the corpbanca insurance brokers an amount equal to the average of the insurance brokerage fees paid by ita&#250; insurance company to corpbanca or the corpbanca insurance brokers under this section 4.20 in the 12-month period prior to the insurance termination date. &#160;
