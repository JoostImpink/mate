(d) if at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, there is a capital reorganization of the common stock (other than a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange, or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this section 4.5 ), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall be made so that investor shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon exercise of the option the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of company to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section 4.5 with respect to the rights of investor after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this section 4.5 shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(f) for the purpose of making any adjustment to the exercise price required under this section 4.5 , if company issues or sells any rights or options or convertible securities and if the effective price of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights or options and/or the conversion or exchange of convertible securities (computed without reference to any additional or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the exercise price then in effect, then company shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the issuance of such rights, options or convertible securities, that number of additional shares of common stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of such rights, options or convertible securities upon their issuance and to have received, as the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such shares, an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by -12- company for the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities, plus, in the case of such rights or options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to company upon the exercise in full of such rights or options, plus, in the case of convertible securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such convertible securities) upon the conversion or exchange thereof; provided that: (i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then company shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses; (ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to company upon the exercise of rights or options or the conversion or exchange of convertible securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the effective price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced; and (iii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to company upon the exercise of such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of convertible securities is subsequently increased, then the effective price shall again be recalculated using the increased minimum amount of consideration payable to company upon the exercise of such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (g) no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of common stock on the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of any such convertible securities. if any such rights or options or the conversion rights represented by any such convertible securities shall expire without having been fully exercised, then the exercise price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities shall be readjusted to the exercise price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that the only shares of common stock so issued were the shares of common stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, and such shares of common stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by company upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling all such convertible securities actually converted or exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such convertible securities) on the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities.

(i) all calculations under this section 4.5 shall be made to the nearest 1 / 100 th of a share, as the case may be. 4.6 no fractional shares . no fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issuable upon the exercise of the option, but on exercise of the option, investor may purchase only a whole number of shares of common stock. if, on exercise of the option, investor would be entitled to a fractional share of common stock or a right to acquire a fractional share of common stock, such -13- fractional share shall be disregarded and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise shall be the next higher whole number of shares. 4.7 anti-dilution protection .
