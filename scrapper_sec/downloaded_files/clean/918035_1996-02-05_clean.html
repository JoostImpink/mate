shareholders,(ii) a roberts family shareholder agreement (the "family shareholder agreement") among the shareholders and (iii) a stockholders' agreement (the "monsanto stockholders' agreement") among the shareholders and monsanto company ("monsanto"). the following summaries of the voting trust agreement, the family shareholder agreement and the monsanto stockholders' agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to this schedule and are incorporated herein by reference. voting trust agreement pursuant to the terms of the voting trust agreement, the shares of class a common stock reported in this schedule were transferred to each of the filing persons, as voting trustees, for deposit pursuant to the voting trust agreement. any shareholder who subsequently acquires any shares of class a common stock of the company will deposit such shares with the voting trustees to be held pursuant to the voting trust agreement (any shares deposited with the voting trustees pursuant to the voting trust agreement are referred to as "subject shares"). the voting trustees are not required to recognize any transfer of any trust certificate not made in accordance with the family shareholder agreement and the monsanto stockholders' agreement. the voting trust agreement provides that the voting trustees will have full right and power to vote all subject shares upon all matters submitted to a vote or consent of shareholders of the company. the voting trustees will vote all subject shares as a unit in accordance with the determination of a majority of the voting trustees (or, if only two voting trustees are acting, as they agree), except that with respect to the investment agreement matters (as defined herein under "-- monsanto stockholders' agreement") or business combinations (as defined in the monsanto stockholders' agreement) involving the company ("company business combinations"), the voting trustees will vote in accordance with the instructions of holders of trust certificates or, if no instructions are given, in accordance with the recommendation of the board of directors of the company. all dividends or distributions upon the subject shares will be paid by the voting trustees to the holders of trust certificates ratably based on the number of subject shares reflected on the trust certificates, except that any dividend or distribution of voting stock of the company will be deposited pursuant to the voting trust agreement. the voting trustees have no power to sell or otherwise dispose of any subject shares, except that the voting trustees are required to tender or exchange subject shares in accordance with the terms of any tender or exchange offer if (i) the voting trustees are so instructed by the holder of the trust certificate for such subject shares and (ii) such tender or exchange offer, if consummated, would result in the beneficial ownership by a group or person of all of the shares of class a common stock and all of the shares of class b common stock of the company ("class b common stock") and the company has previously published its position or recommendation with respect to such tender or exchange offer pursuant to applicable rules under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (any such tender or exchange

subject shares from the voting trust agreement after compliance with the procedures described in the following paragraph. any shareholder desiring to withdraw subject shares from the voting trust agreement must give written notice to the other shareholders, each of whom will then have an option to purchase his or her pro rata portion of such subject shares at a market price based on a thirty day average of the daily closing prices for the class b common stock on the nasdaq national market system ("nasdaq")(or, if there is no such market price, an appraised value for such subject shares). if such other shareholders have not elected to acquire all of such subject shares, then each shareholder who elected to acquire subject shares will have a further option to purchase his or her pro rata portion of the subject shares which such other shareholders have not elected to acquire. any subject shares not acquired by such other shareholders after such further option may be withdrawn from the voting trust agreement and will no longer be subject to the family shareholder agreement. the family shareholder agreement provides that the restrictions on transfer therein will not apply to certain permitted transfers ("permitted transfers") specified therein, including (i) certain pledges of company voting stock, (ii) a transfer of company voting stock to other shareholders or other spouses, descendants or certain other trusts or other entities, (iii) any exchange, conversion or transfer of company voting stock in connection with a company business combination (as defined below)

the company's board of directors and that if monsanto acquires 20% or more of the outstanding common stock of the company pursuant to the monsanto offer and the investment agreement, monsanto may nominate for election in january 1997 an additional member to the company's board (any such nominee or nominees being referred to as "monsanto nominees"), (ii) the by-laws of the company will be amended to (a) state that the primary business of the company is the research- based production, marketing, licensing and sale of agronomic seed, including both technology related thereto and products

maximum amount of voting securities of the company to be issued to any individual, entity or group will not exceed 10% of the voting securities of the company then outstanding) and (c) prohibit the company from acquiring any business or assets outside of such primary business that would constitute a substantial part (as defined in the investment agreement) of the company; provided that such by-law amendments would permit the company to change -------- its primary business, issue voting securities to facilitate a strategic collaboration or acquire any business outside of such primary business unless three (two prior to the company's 1997 annual meeting of stockholders) of the members of the board vote against the resolution relating to such change or transaction (such by-law provisions described in this clause (ii) being referred to as the "by-law provisions") and (iii) after the closing, while monsanto beneficially owns either 5% of the class a common stock or 20% of the class b common stock, if the company proposes to issue for cash (subject to specified limitations) any shares of common stock, securities convertible into such shares or options, warrants or rights to acquire such shares ("equity"), monsanto will have the right to purchase all or any portion of its pro rata share of such equity on the terms set forth in the investment agreement (the provisions described in this clause (iii) being referred to as the "equity purchase provisions" and the provisions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as the "investment agreement

---------------------------------------------- stockholders' agreement provides that each shareholder will use best efforts to attend each stockholder meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum and will vote all of its shares of company voting stock in favor of any monsanto nominee recommended by the board of directors of the company, provided that such monsanto nominee is reasonably satisfactory to the company. in addition, the monsanto stockholders' agreement provides that each shareholder will not, without the consent of monsanto, initiate any action that would result in the amendment of the by-law provisions and that each shareholder will vote its company voting stock in favor of any proposed amendment to the company's certificate of incorporation to increase the company's authorized capital stock, which amendment is required in order for the company to comply with the equity purchase provisions. monsanto has agreed to indemnify the shareholders and related persons from and against all claims, losses and liabilities which arise from or in connection with actions or inactions in the performance of the obligations of the shareholders under the provisions described in this paragraph. the monsanto stockholders' agreement provides that except for permitted transfers (i) no shareholder may transfer any interest in its company voting stock except as provided by the monsanto stockholders' agreement, (ii) with limited exceptions, no shareholder will convert any class a common stock to class b common stock until such time as such shareholder has entered into a binding agreement to sell or convey such class b common stock to a third party and (iii) no shareholder will tender any of its company voting stock in the monsanto offer. if any shareholder desires to transfer any interest in its company voting stock (other than a permitted transfer) such shareholder will make a written offer to monsanto (a "shareholder offer") to purchase such company voting stock and monsanto will have the option to purchase all but not less than all of such company voting stock for the price and upon the terms upon which such shareholder proposes to transfer such company voting stock. if monsanto rejects the shareholder offer, monsanto has the exclusive right for a period of time to propose alternative terms for such purchase. if monsanto does not accept the shareholder offer and monsanto and such shareholder have not otherwise reached an agreement regarding such purchase within such time period, then such shareholder may offer and sell such company voting stock to any person or entity on terms that are at least as favorable to such shareholder as those set forth in the shareholder offer or those offered by monsanto in any counter offer. in the event of any involuntary transfer of any company voting stock (other than a permitted transfer), monsanto will have an exclusive option to purchase all but not less than all of the company voting stock in cash at a purchase price (i) based on a thirty day average of the daily closing prices for the class b common stock on nasdaq or (ii) if the company voting stock is not class a common stock or if the class b common stock is not publicly traded, based on the fair market value thereof determined by an investment banking firm. the monsanto stockholders' agreement will be effective until the earlier of (i) the termination of the collaboration agreement (except if it is terminated by reason of a material breach thereof by the company or by reason of a governmental decree caused by voluntary action of the company), (ii) monsanto owning less than 5% of the outstanding class a common stock or less than 50% of the highest percent of the outstanding common stock beneficially owned by monsanto after completion of the monsanto offer, the closing and any purchases in the market of class b common stock by monsanto as permitted under the investment agreement

dated december 21, 1967, (iii) the trust f/b/o virginia r. holt under eleanor t. roberts charitable trust agreement dated december 21, 1967, and (iv) the trust f/b/o john t. roberts under eleanor t.

class a common stock (the "common stock") of dekalb genetics corporation, a delaware corporation (the "company"), and deem it to be in their mutual best interests to confer upon the voting trustees the right to vote and to act with respect to such common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement; and whereas, each depositor is depositing, in accordance with this agreement, all shares of common stock that he or she now owns (the "subject shares"), a list of which is attached hereto as exhibit a. now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. deposit of common stock with voting trustees. concurrently with -------------------------------------------- the execution and delivery of this agreement, the depositors shall deliver the certificates representing the subject shares to the voting trustees, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfying the requirements established by the company for transfer of shares of its common stock executed by, such depositors or their attorneys duly authorized in writing, with a signature guarantee acceptable to the company, and the voting trustees shall deliver such certificates and instruments of transfer to the company with a letter of direction to cancel such certificates and to issue and deliver to the voting trustees, in exchange for the certificate or certificates standing in the name of the depositors and delivered by the voting trustees, a certificate or certificates registered in the name of the voting trustees and representing the subject shares. in addition, any depositor who acquires any common stock after the date of this agreement shall deposit such common stock with the voting trustees within thirty (30) days after having acquired such common stock by transferring such common stock to the voting trustees according to the provisions of this section 1. any such after-acquired shares of common stock that are so deposited with the voting trustees are included in, and covered by, any reference to subject shares in the rest of this agreement. the voting trustees and the depositors acknowledge and agree that (a) each such delivery to the voting trustees hereunder shall constitute a deposit on behalf of the depositor of the depositor's subject shares with the voting trustees for purposes of delaware code annotated title 8, section 218 (1995) and (b) upon each such deposit the right to vote such shares of common stock shall be vested in the voting trustees until january 31, 2006, all upon the terms and conditions stated in this agreement. each certificate so issued to the voting trustees shall state that it is issued pursuant to this agreement, and that fact shall also be stated in the stock ledger of the company. 2. issuance of trust certificates. as and when the voting trustees ------------------------------ shall receive from the company on behalf of a depositor certificates representing shares of common stock registered in the name of the voting trustees, the voting trustees shall issue and deliver to such depositor a trust certificate or certificates substantially in the form of exhibit b attached hereto (hereinafter called "trust certificates") for the number of shares of common stock deposited on behalf of such depositor, and such depositor shall be recorded in the book or books of the voting trustees kept pursuant to section 3 hereof as the registered holder of such trust certificates. 3. transfer of trust certificates. the persons who are or who shall ------------------------------ become from time to time the registered holders of record of trust certificates (hereinafter called "registered holders") shall be treated by the voting trustees as being the absolute owner of the common stock deposited pursuant to this agreement, no other person shall be recognized as having any right, title or interest in such common stock, and the voting trustees shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary. the voting trustees shall keep a book or books at the office of the voting trustees located c/o douglas c. roberts, dekalb genetics corporation, 3100 sycamore road, dekalb, illinois 60115, or such other place as the voting trustees may specify in a notice given to all registered holders when, if ever, such location is changed. such book or books shall record the issuance and any transfer of trust certificates and shall contain the names and addresses of registered holders and the number of shares of common stock represented by the trust certificates in their names. subject to the following paragraphs of this section 3, upon surrender of any trust certificate duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the voting trustees executed by, the registered holder or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, with signatures guaranteed by a bank or member firm of the new york stock exchange, the voting trustees shall cause such trust certificate to be canceled and a new trust certificate or certificates to be issued and registered in such books and in the name of the transferee or transferees of such surrendered trust certificate, subject to any reasonable rules established for that purpose by the voting trustees; and such transferee or transferees shall thereby become registered holders and parties to, and bound by the terms and conditions (other than the first sentence of section 1) of, this agreement. the subject shares and interests therein are subject to restrictions on the transfer thereof, which restrictions have been set forth in the roberts family shareholder agreement dated as of january 31, 1996, among the depositors (the "shareholder agreement"), and the stockholders' agreement, dated as of january 31, 1996, among the depositors, the voting trustees and monsanto company (the "monsanto agreement"), each of which is on file with the voting trustees for this purpose. the voting trustees shall not be required to recognize the transfer of any trust certificate not made in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, the shareholder agreement and the monsanto agreement. whenever the stock transfer books of the company are closed for any proper purpose, the voting trustees shall close the transfer books for trust certificates for such period, and whenever a record date is properly fixed as a record date in lieu of closing the stock transfer books of the company, the voting trustees shall use the same record date for any rights consequent thereon. 4. voting deposited stock. during the period that any shares of ---------------------- common stock are deposited hereunder, the voting trustees shall have, with respect to all such shares of common stock, the full and unqualified right and power to vote in person or by proxy for, or (to the extent, if any, permitted by the articles of incorporation of the company) to consent in writing to, the election of directors of the company and upon all other matters which shall be submitted to a vote or for the written consent of shareholders of the company, to the same extent that in the absence of this agreement, the holders of such shares of common stock deposited hereunder would be entitled to possess, enjoy and exercise, including the right and power to waive notice of the holding of any meeting of holders of the common stock of the company. except as otherwise provided in section 5 below, the voting trustees shall vote all shares of common stock deposited hereunder as a unit in accordance with the determination of a majority of the voting trustees, or if only two voting trustees are acting hereunder, as a unit as the voting trustees shall agree. 5. discretion of voting trustees. the voting trustees agree to ----------------------------- exercise their best judgment from time to time in voting the common stock deposited hereunder and in consenting to or acting upon corporate acts of the company; provided, however, that with respect to voting of such shares in connection with a matter contemplated by section 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5 of the monsanto agreement or in connection with a business combination (as such term is defined in the monsanto agreement), the voting trustees shall vote such number of shares as are reflected on the trust certificate(s) of each registered holder in accordance with the instructions of such registered holder or, if no such instructions are given, in accordance with the recommendation of the board of directors of the company. the voting trustees, as such or in their individual capacities, shall assume no responsibility in respect of any action taken by them or any action taken in furtherance of any vote or consent which they may give or by reason of any action taken by the management of the company, and the voting trustees shall not incur any responsibility or liability as voting trustees or otherwise by reason of any error of law, fact or judgment or by reason of any matter or thing done or omitted to be done under this agreement, except in each case for their own individual malfeasance. 6. successor voting trustee. any of the voting trustees may resign ------------------------ at any time by an instrument in writing delivered to the other voting trustees. in the event any voting trustee who is a depositor serves withdrawal notices pursuant to the shareholder agreement which cumulatively involve more than one-half of such voting trustee's subject shares, the other voting trustees shall have the power to remove such person as a voting trustee by written instrument delivered to such person. the voting trustees may by written instrument signed by all voting trustees who are then acting designate a successor voting trustee or a succession of successor voting trustees, or establish a procedure for selecting a successor voting trustee or a succession of successor voting trustees, provided that any such instrument shall not be effective until it has been filed in the registered office of the company in the state of delaware. if at any time no voting trustee is acting or qualified to act and no written instrument has been adopted pursuant to the preceding sentence, the successor voting trustee shall be such person, persons, or succession of persons, as shall be designated in an instrument in writing signed by charles c. roberts and delivered to the voting trustees at a time when charles c. roberts is acting as a voting trustee. 7. dividends; rights to subscribe, etc. an amount equal to any and ------------------------------------ all dividends or distributions in cash or property which may be received by the voting trustees during the term of this agreement upon common stock deposited hereunder shall be paid by them (as and when received or as soon thereafter as may be practical) ratably (based on the number of shares of common stock reflected on the trust certificate(s) of each registered holder) to the registered holders as shown by the books of the voting trustees on the record date for such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that the voting trustees may, in their discretion from time to time, instead of receiving and distributing such dividends or distributions, authorize the company to make payment or delivery thereof directly to the registered holders. if any dividend shall be paid or distribution made in shares of stock of the company having voting rights, such shares shall be deposited hereunder and held by the voting trustees in the same manner and upon the same terms and conditions as the shares of common stock deposited with the voting trustees pursuant to section 1 of this agreement upon which such dividend was paid or such distribution was made. thereupon, appropriate trust certificates shall be issued to the registered holders entitled to such dividend or distribution as shown by the books of the voting trustees. if rights to subscribe to purchase or acquire any shares of stock or other assets of the company should inure to the voting trustees in respect of shares of common stock deposited with the voting trustees, the voting trustees, upon the request of the registered holder of the trust certificates issued with respect to such shares accompanied by the funds required for such purpose, shall exercise such rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire such shares of stock or other assets with respect to such deposited shares of common stock. any additional shares of stock of the company having voting rights so acquired by the voting trustees shall thereupon be deemed to have been deposited by such registered holder with the voting trustees, subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, and an appropriate trust certificate shall be issued to such registered holder. any other shares of stock or assets received by the voting trustees shall be promptly delivered to such registered holder. the voting trustees shall have no power to sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of the common stock or other voting shares of stock of the company held by the voting trustees for other securities, cash or other property; provided, however, that the voting trustees shall tender or exchange shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of any tender or exchange offer, if (i) the voting trustees are so instructed in writing by a registered holder with respect to a number of shares of common stock not in excess of the number of shares reflected on the trust certificate(s) issued to such registered holder and (ii) such tender or exchange offer would result, if consummated in accordance with its terms, in the beneficial ownership by any person or group (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")) of all of the common stock and class b common stock of the company; provided, however, that the voting trustees shall not surrender any common stock in connection with such tender or exchange offer unless the company has previously published to security holders of the company a statement pursuant to rule 14e-2 (or any successor rule) under the exchange act. in the event that the tendered shares are accepted by the offeror or the exchange is consummated, then the consideration therefor shall be distributed to such registered holder upon such registered holder's surrender for cancellation of trust certificates representing at least the number of shares of common stock so accepted or exchanged. if such registered holder surrenders trust certificates representing more than the number of shares of common stock so accepted or exchanged, the voting trustees shall issue to such registered holder a new trust certificate representing such registered holder's remaining subject shares. the voting trustees shall send or cause to be sent to all registered holders, copies of all requests, notices, proxy statements and other documents sent by the company to its stockholders, promptly upon their becoming available. 8. term. this agreement shall terminate with respect to any share ---- of common stock at any time deposited hereunder on the earliest to occur of (a) the date on which such share of common stock is withdrawn by a depositor in accordance with the provisions of the shareholder agreement, (b) the date on which all voting trustees agree in writing to such termination, or (c) the date when the voting of such share ceases to be vested in the voting trustee. 9. termination procedure. upon any termination of this agreement --------------------- with respect to any share of common stock deposited hereunder and the surrender for cancellation of the trust certificate representing such share, the voting trustees shall cause such share to be registered in the name of the registered holder of such trust certificate or, if such trust certificate (a) is duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the voting trustees executed by, the registered holder or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, with signatures guaranteed by a bank or member firm of the new york stock exchange, and (b) is accompanied by any required transfer tax stamps or funds therefor, in the name or names of his or her nominee or nominees. the trust certificates so surrendered shall thereupon be canceled by the voting trustees. 10. acceptance of trust; compensation. the voting trustees hereby --------------------------------- accept the trust hereby created subject to all of the terms, conditions and requirements herein contained and each of them agrees to exercise the powers and perform the duties of voting trustee as herein set forth. any voting trustee who is an initial voting trustee or a spouse or a descendant of an initial voting trustee shall not receive or accept any compensation for services as voting trustee hereunder, but any other voting trustee shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for services as voting trustee hereunder; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any voting trustee from receiving compensation as a director, officer, employee or agent of the company. 11. miscellany. (a) it is the intent and understanding of each ---------- party hereto that if any term or provision of this agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, then such term or provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable by such court or other authority.

-------------------------------------- each major a stockholder shall vote its shares of stock in favor of any proposed amendment to the company's certificate of incorporation increasing the company's authorized capital stock, which amendment is required in order for the company to comply with the provisions of article 10 of the investment agreement. 2.6 injunctive relief. in the event of a breach of the provisions of this ----------------- article 2 by any of the major a stockholders, monsanto will suffer irreparable harm and the total amount of monetary damages will be impossible to calculate and will therefore be an inadequate remedy. accordingly, in such event, monsanto shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief against the breaching party and to any other rights and remedies to which monsanto may be entitled to at law or in equity. 2.7 indemnification of major a stockholders. --------------------------------------- (a) monsanto's indemnification agreement. subject to paragraph (b) below, ------------------------------------ monsanto shall indemnify and hold the major a stockholders and their respective affiliates, trustees, trust beneficiaries, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each an "indemnified person") harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, fines, penalties, demands, causes of action, suits, judgments, losses, injuries, damages (including costs of defense, settlement and reasonable attorneys' fees) (all of the foregoing hereinafter collectively called "losses") suffered or incurred by any indemnified person which arise from or in connection with actions or inactions of any indemnified person in the performance of the obligations of any major a stockholder under this article 2. (b) procedure. in the event that, from and after the closing, a third --------- person asserts any claim against any indemnified person with respect to any matter to which the foregoing indemnities apply, the indemnified person shall give prompt written notice to monsanto, and monsanto shall have the right, at its election, to take over the defense or settlement of such claim at its own expense by giving prompt written notice to the indemnified person; provided, however, that, (i) if monsanto does not give such notice and does not proceed diligently to defend the claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of the claim, then the indemnified person may employ separate counsel to represent it and defend it against such claim and monsanto shall be bound by any defense or settlement that the indemnified person may make as to such claim and shall reimburse the indemnified person for any and all losses resulting therefrom as such losses are incurred and (ii) if monsanto elects to defend the claim, then monsanto shall employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified person and the indemnified person shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such claim and to employ separate counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such claim, unless the common counsel determines, in compliance with the canons of ethics of the legal profession, that a conflict of interest exists between monsanto and an indemnified person, in which event the indemnified person may appoint separate counsel to represent or defend it against the claim and monsanto shall reimburse such indemnified person for all losses resulting therefrom as such losses are incurred. the indemnified person and monsanto shall cooperate in defending any such third person's claim, and monsanto, to the extent monsanto elects to defend such claim, shall have reasonable access to records, information and personnel in the possession or control of any other party hereto which are applicable to the subject matter of any claim or which are otherwise pertinent to the defense of such claim and the indemnified person shall otherwise cooperate with monsanto in all respects in connection therewith. monsanto shall reimburse the indemnified person for all of the indemnified person's reasonable out- of-pocket costs as they are incurred in connection with the activities set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and in enforcing this indemnification. notwithstanding the foregoing, monsanto shall not settle or compromise any such claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified person, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, unless, after consultation between such parties, the terms of such settlement or compromise release such indemnified person from any and all liability with respect to such claim and do not in any manner adversely affect the future operations or activities of such indemnified person. article 3 limitation on certain transfers ------------------------------- 3.1 general limitations on certain transfers. ---------------------------------------- (a) subject to section 3.5, during the term of this agreement, no major a stockholder shall in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, voluntarily or by operation of law, sell, convey, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of ("transfer") any interest in its stock to any person or convert any of its class a common stock to class b common stock except as provided under the terms of this agreement after complying with the provisions of this article 3. (b) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement including this article 3, in no event shall any major a stockholder tender any of its shares of stock in the tender offer to purchase shares of class b common stock to be made by monsanto pursuant to the terms described in the investment agreement. 3.2 limitation on certain conversions and transfers. ----------------------------------------------- (a) limitation on conversions. except pursuant to a court order entered ------------------------- in connection with a divorce proceeding to an ex-spouse of douglas c. roberts, virginia roberts holt or john t. roberts or to an ex-spouse of a lineal descendant of douglas c. roberts, virginia roberts holt or john t. roberts, no major a stockholder shall convert any of its class a common stock to class b common stock until such time as such major a stockholder has entered into a binding agreement to sell or otherwise convey such class b common stock to a third party. (b) limitations on voluntary transfers. subject to section 3.5, in the ---------------------------------- event that any major a stockholder desires to transfer any interest in its stock, including, without limitation, a redemption of such stock by the company, such major a stockholder (the "selling stockholder") shall make a written offer (the "transfer notice") to monsanto stating (i) the number of shares of stock proposed to be so transferred (the "offered stock") and (ii) the price, form of consideration and other material terms upon which the offered stock are being offered; provided, however, that in the event the transfer notice shall state that the major a stockholder intends to dispose of such offered stock by means of an underwritten public offering (a "public offering"), in lieu of stating a price at which the offered stock is being offered, the major a stockholder may state an estimated price (less estimated underwriting discounts and expenses of sale) at which the major a stockholder is advised in writing by the managing underwriter as its good faith estimate of the average between the estimated minimum and maximum amounts at which such offered stock may be sold in the public offering (the "average price"). for a period of twenty-five (25) days (if the form of consideration specified in the transfer notice only includes cash and/or shares of stock traded in the nasdaq national market system or on a u.s. securities exchange ("traded stock")), or ninety (90) days (if the form of consideration specified in the transfer notice includes property other than cash or traded stock) following the date of the transfer notice (the "offer period"), monsanto shall have the irrevocable and exclusive option (but not obligation) to purchase all (but not less than all) of the offered stock in cash for the price per share and upon the other terms specified in the transfer notice; provided, however, in the event the -------- ------- transfer notice shall have stated that the major a stockholder intends to dispose of the offered stock in a public offering, monsanto may purchase the offered stock at the average price (less the estimated amount of underwriting discounts and expenses of offering) stated in the transfer notice; provided, further, that if the proposed -------- ------- consideration specified in the transfer notice includes property other than cash, then monsanto shall have the option to purchase the offered stock for consideration other than cash that is equal in value to the non-cash property specified in the transfer notice; and provided, further, that if the consummation of the transfer described in the transfer notice would cause the selling stockholder to recognize less gain for income tax purposes than the amount of taxable gain which the selling stockholder would recognize as a result of a cash sale to monsanto, then the aggregate purchase price for the offered stock payable by monsanto shall be increased by an amount equal to (a) the gain which would not have otherwise been recognized for income tax purposes multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is one minus the highest marginal income tax rate on capital gains for individuals in effect at such time, minus (b) the gain which would not have otherwise been recognized for income tax purposes. the gain which would not have otherwise been recognized for income tax purposes shall be computed using the selling stockholder's actual tax basis in the offered stock based upon (i) such records as monsanto shall reasonably request and (ii) as are certified by such selling stockholder as true, complete, and correct. monsanto's option to purchase the shares of offered stock shall be exercised by giving written notice to the selling stockholder within the offer period. alternatively, if monsanto rejects the selling shareholder's offer to sell the offered stock for the price per share and upon the terms specified in the transfer notice, then, for the remainder of the offer period, monsanto shall have the exclusive right to propose alternative terms to the selling stockholder for the purchase of the offered stock at such price per share and upon such terms as the parties may agree upon. subject to section 3.5, in the event a selling stockholder proposes to dispose of offered stock in a transaction subject to article 3 hereof for consideration that includes non-cash consideration other than traded stock, such selling stockholder shall stipulate the value of such property in the transfer notice and shall, at the request of monsanto, provide to monsanto, at the selling stockholder's expense, a written valuation of such property prepared by a nationally-recognized firm experienced in appraising the specified type of property , which sets forth the value of such property. in the event that monsanto does not agree with such valuation, monsanto shall deliver a written notice of such disagreement to the selling stockholder within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the written valuation and shall thereafter deliver to the selling stockholder within thirty (30) days following delivery of such disagreement, at monsanto's expense, a written valuation of such property prepared on the same basis by another nationally-recognized firm experienced in appraising the specified type of property, which sets forth the value of such property. the selling stockholder may either accept such subsequent valuation or deliver written notice of its disagreement with such valuation to such selling stockholder. in the latter event, the selling stockholder and monsanto shall agree to the appointment of a third nationally-recognized firm experienced in appraising the specified type of property, who shall be selected by mutual agreement of their respective nationally-recognized firms, whose valuation shall establish conclusively the price for purposes of the transfer notice. the expense of such third firm shall be borne equally by the parties. if property to be received by a selling stockholder includes shares of stock that are traded on the nasdaq national market system or any other system then in use, then the value of a share of such stock shall be deemed to be the last reported sale price (or, if not available, the average of the closing bid and ask price) per share during the 30-day period immediately preceding the date of the transfer notice. if the property to be received by a selling stockholder includes shares of a stock that is listed on a united states securities exchange registered under the exchange act, then the value of a share of such stock shall be deemed to be the average of the closing sale price per share of such stock during the 30-day period immediately preceding the date of the transfer notice on the principal united states securities exchange registered under the exchange act on which such stock is listed. (c) acceptance of offer. if, during the offer period, monsanto exercises ------------------- its right to purchase the offered stock at the price per share and upon the terms specified in the transfer notice or if the parties otherwise reach an agreement regarding the price, terms and conditions of the sale, then the selling stockholder shall sell the shares of offered stock to monsanto in accordance with the price per share and terms specified in the transfer notice or pursuant to such price, terms and conditions otherwise agreed upon by the parties, including standard terms and conditions for a stock purchase agreement. the closing of any such purchase shall take place no later than twenty- five (25) days (if the form of consideration specified in the transfer notice only includes cash or traded stock) or ninety (90) days (if the form of consideration specified in the transfer notice includes property other than cash or traded stock) following the expiration of the offer period. (d) nonacceptance of offer. if, at the end of the offer period, monsanto ---------------------- has not exercised its right to purchase the offered stock at the price per share and upon the terms specified in the transfer notice and the parties have not otherwise reached an agreement regarding the price, terms and conditions of the sale, then such selling stockholder shall be entitled to offer and sell such shares of offered stock to any person (free and clear of any rights of monsanto) provided that the price, terms and conditions of such sale, considered as a whole, are at least as favorable to the selling stockholder as either (i) those set forth in the transfer notice or (ii) those offered by monsanto in any counter offer, if any; provided, in the event the transfer notice shall have stated an average price, the offered stock may be disposed of in a public offering at a price no less than the minimum amount used as a basis to calculate the average price (less actual underwriting discounts and expenses). notwithstanding the foregoing, if the selling stockholder shall not have signed a definitive agreement to sell the offered stock within one hundred eighty (180) days immediately following the expiration of the offer period, then the shares of offered stock shall again be subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement in the same manner as if the transfer notice had not been given. (e) limitations on involuntary transfers. subject to section 3.5, if any ------------------------------------ involuntary transfer of any of the stock owned by a major a stockholder (a "transferring stockholder") shall occur (such as, but not limited to, a sale by a major a stockholder's trustee in bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at any creditor's or court sale) other than an involuntary transfer to a permitted transferee: (i) transferee takes subject hereto. the transferee (which term, as ------------------------------- used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the initial transferee) shall take and hold such stock subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities and rights under this agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect. (ii) involuntary transfer notice. the transferring stockholder (or, --------------------------- if it fails to do so, the transferee) shall promptly give written notice (the "involuntary transfer notice") to monsanto and the company stating (a) when the involuntary transfer occurred or is to occur, (b) the circumstances alleged to require such transfer, (c) the number of shares of stock involved and (d) the name, address and capacity of the transferee. if both the transferring stockholder and the transferee shall fail to give the involuntary transfer notice, then the involuntary transfer notice may be given by the company or by any other stockholder of the company and the involuntary transfer notice so given may contain only such portion of the information set forth in the preceding sentence as shall be known to the person so giving the involuntary transfer notice. (iii) purchase option. monsanto shall have the irrevocable and --------------- exclusive option (but not the obligation) for a period of forty- five (45) days immediately following receipt of the involuntary transfer notice to purchase all but not less than all of the shares of stock included in the involuntary transfer notice (the "involuntary transfer stock") in cash for the price per share and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this section 3.2(e). an election to exercise monsanto's option shall be made by monsanto by giving written notice to the company, the transferee and the transferring stockholder. (iv) failure to give notice. failure by monsanto to give the notice ---------------------- provided for in paragraph (e)(iii) within the time period provided for therein shall be deemed an election by monsanto not to purchase any shares of the involuntary transfer stock. (v) closing. if the shares of involuntary transfer stock are to be ------- purchased by monsanto pursuant to this section 3.2(e), then such purchase shall, unless the parties thereto otherwise agree, be completed at the principal office of monsanto on the thirtieth (30th) day following the giving of notice by monsanto pursuant to paragraph (e)(iii) of its election to exercise its option to purchase the involuntary transfer stock. (vi) purchase price. the price per share of the involuntary transfer -------------- stock to be paid by monsanto upon exercise of its option to purchase such involuntary transfer stock pursuant to paragraph (e)(iii) shall be as follows: (a) with respect to shares of class a common stock, if the shares of the company's class b common stock are then traded in the nasdaq national market system or on a united states securities exchange registered under the exchange act, the price per share shall be the average of the last reported sales price (or, if not available, the average of the closing bid and ask price) per share of the company's class b common stock on the nasdaq national market system (or such other securities exchange on which the company's class b common stock is then listed) on each of the thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the closing of the purchase of such class a common stock; and (b) with respect to shares of any involuntary transfer stock other than class a common stock, or, with respect to shares of class a common stock if the company's class b common stock is not then listed on the nasdaq national market system or on a united states securities exchange registered under the exchange act, the price per share shall be the fair market value per share as determined by an investment banking firm of recognized standing selected by mutual agreement of the transferee or transferring stockholder, as the case may be (depending on who is the legal owner of the involuntary transfer stock), and monsanto. if the transferee or the transferring stockholder, as the case may be, and monsanto are unable to agree upon an investment banking firm to perform the valuation, then both monsanto and the transferee or the transferring stockholder, as the case may be, shall select an investment banking firm and the two investment banking firms so selected shall select a third investment banking firm to perform the valuation. the determination of the third investment banking firm as to the fair market value per share shall be final and binding on the parties. if the parties are unable to mutually agree upon an investment banking firm to perform the valuation, then monsanto and the transferee or the transferring stockholder, as the case may be, shall pay the fees of the investment banking firm selected by each such party. the fees of any investment banking firm mutually agreed upon by the parties and the fees of any third investment banking firm performing the valuation in connection with the services provided pursuant to this paragraph (e)(vi) shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by monsanto and fifty percent (50%) by the transferee or the transferring stockholder, as the case may be. (vii) delivery of certificates. at the closing of the ------------------------ purchase and sale of involuntary transfer stock pursuant to the exercise of options granted under this section 3.2, the transferring stockholder or the transferee, as the case may be, shall deliver to monsanto duly endorsed for transfer, with all required state or federal documentary tax stamps affixed thereto, certificates representing all of the shares of involuntary transfer stock being purchased and sold at such closing against payment therefor in cash or certified or bank cashier's check. in addition, the transferring stockholder or the transferee, as the case may be, shall deliver to monsanto such signature guarantees and other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by monsanto in order to confirm the transferring stockholder's or the transferee's, as the case may be, title to such involuntary transfer stock and its authority to act in connection with the sale thereof. 3.3 legend. a copy of this agreement shall be filed with the secretary of the ------ company and shall be kept at its principal executive office. upon the execution of this agreement, each of the major a stockholders shall cause each certificate representing shares of stock owned by such major a stockholder to carry a legend as follows: the securities represented by this certificate may not be sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, mortgaged or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer complies with the provisions of a stockholders' agreement dated as of january 31, 1996,

shareholder agreement); provided, however, that the permitted transferee, if not then a party to this agreement, shall execute a counterpart to this agreement acknowledging that it has become a party

stock to any trustee, guardian, executor, administrator, voting trustee of the voting trust or other fiduciary acting solely for the benefit of one or more permitted transferees; (d) the granting of a proxy with respect to stock solicited by the board of directors; (e) any exchange, conversion or transfer of stock in connection with a business combination; provided, however, that this clause (e)

an agreement with respect to such business combination; or (f) any tender or exchange of stock in accordance with the terms of any tender or exchange offer, which tender or exchange offer would
