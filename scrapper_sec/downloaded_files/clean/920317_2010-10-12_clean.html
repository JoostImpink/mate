(iii) the corporation shall give each holder of record of series c preferred stock written notice, at the address last shown on the records of the corporation for such holder, of such impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholders&#146; meeting called to approve such transaction (or, if the transaction is approved by written consent, the first execution of a written consent), or twenty (20) days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction. the first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this section 3 , and the corporation shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. the transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the corporation has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however, that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of series c preferred stock that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of series c preferred stock. 4 4. voting rights . the holder of each share of series c preferred stock shall have the right to one vote for each share of common stock into which such series c preferred stock could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of common stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision hereof, to notice of any stockholders&#146; meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the corporation, and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of common stock, with respect to any question upon which holders of common stock have the right to vote. fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of series c preferred stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to be nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward). except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, the holders of series c preferred stock and the holders of common stock shall vote together and not as separate classes. other than as provided herein or required by law, there shall be no series voting. conversion . (a) conversion rights . the holders of the outstanding shares of series c preferred stock have the conversion rights set forth in this section 5 (&#147; conversion rights &#148;). each share of series c preferred stock will be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the later of the date of issuance of such share and june 30, 2009, at the office of the corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing the stated value of the series c preferred stock to be converted by the conversion price applicable to such share, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate evidencing such shares is surrendered for conversion. the initial &#147; conversion price &#148; shall be one dollar ($1.00); provided, however, that the conversion price for the series c preferred stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection (c) of this section 5 . for illustration purposes, if the stated value of one share of series c preferred stock is $100 and the conversion price is $1.00, then one share of series c preferred stock shall be convertible into 100 shares of common stock, subject to section 5(f) below. (b) mechanics of conversion . before any holder of series c preferred stock shall be entitled to voluntarily convert the same into shares of common stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any transfer agent for the series c preferred stock, and shall give written notice to this corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock are to be issued. this corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of series c preferred stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of series c preferred stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock as of such date. 5 (c) adjustments to conversion price . the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (i) in the event the corporation should, at any time or from time to time after the date upon which any shares of series c preferred stock were first issued (the &#147; purchase date &#148;), fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock or the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of common stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of common stock (&#147; common stock equivalents &#148;) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of common stock or the common stock equivalents (including the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the conversion price shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of common stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such common stock equivalents. (ii) if the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any time after the purchase date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of common stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the conversion price shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares. (d) other distributions . in the event the corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection 5(c)(i) , then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 5(d) , the holders of the series c preferred stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of common stock into which their shares of series c preferred stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of common stock entitled to receive such distribution. (e) recapitalizations . if at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the common stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this section 5 ) provision shall be made so that the holders of the series c preferred stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the series c preferred stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of common stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the series c preferred stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this section 5 (including adjustment of the conversion price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the series c preferred stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. 6 (f) fractional shares . no fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of any share or shares of the series c preferred stock, and the number of shares of common stock to be issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of series c preferred stock the holder is at the time converting into common stock and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion. (g) reservation of stock issuable upon conversion . this corporation shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the series c preferred stock, such number of its shares of common stock as shall from time to time be deemed sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the series c preferred stock under this certificate of designation. 6. no redemption rights . the series c preferred stock shall not be subject to redemption, whether at the option of either the corporation or any holder of the series c preferred stock. 7. consent to certain distributions . to the extent the corporation may be subject to section 2115 of the california corporations code, each holder of shares of series c preferred stock shall be deemed to have consented, for purposes of sections 502 and 503 of the california corporations code, to any dividend, distribution, or repurchase made by the corporation and which is approved by the board of directors. 8. mutilated or missing preferred stock certificates . if any of the series c preferred stock certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the corporation shall issue, in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated series c preferred stock certificate, or in lieu of and in substitution for the series c preferred stock certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new series c preferred stock certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent number of shares of series c preferred stock, but only upon receipt of evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such series c preferred stock certificate and indemnity, if requested. 9. reissuance of preferred stock . shares of series c preferred stock that have been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed or exchanged, shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the state of delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock undesignated as to series and may be redesignated and reissued as part of any series of preferred stock other than the series c preferred stock. 7 10. business day . if any payment, redemption or exchange shall be required by the terms hereof to be made on a day that banks are not open in the state of california, such payment, redemption or exchange shall be made on the immediately succeeding day on which such banks are open. 11. headings of subdivisions . the headings of various subdivisions hereof are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of any of the provisions hereof. 12. severability . if any right, preference or limitation of the series c preferred stock set forth in these resolutions and the certificate of designations filed pursuant hereto (as such resolution may be amended from time to time) is invalid, unlawful or incapable of
