transfer does not comply with the provisions of the act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. 4. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued common stock, solely for the purpose of providing for the exercise of the rights to purchase all warrant shares granted pursuant to the warrants, such number of shares of common stock as shall, from time to time, be sufficient therefor. the company covenants that 2 all shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant, upon receipt by the company of the full exercise price therefor, shall be validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and free of preemptive rights. the company hereby represents and warrants to the purchaser that on the date hereof the number of warrant shares is equal to twenty-percent (20%) of the outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis taking into account the exercise of all stock options, warrants and rights to acquire shares of common stock outstanding on the date hereof, conversion of all shares of the company's preferred stock outstanding on the date hereof, and exercise of this warrant, but specifically excluding the warrants (the "vassell warrants") issued to william vassell pursuant to section 4.2 of the employment agreement dated september 12, 2000 between the company and william vassell. 5. (a) in case the company shall at any time after the date the warrants were first issued (i) declare a dividend on the outstanding common stock payable in shares of its capital stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding common stock, (iii) combine the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issue any shares of its capital stock by reclassification of the common stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the company is the continuing corporation), then, in each case, the exercise price, and the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant, in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination, or reclassification, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares which, if such warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such time, he would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination, or reclassification. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. (b) in case the company shall issue or fix a record date for the issuance to all holders of common stock of rights, options, or warrants to subscribe for or purchase common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion or exchange price per share, if a security convertible into or exchangeable for common stock) less than the exercise price on such record date, then, in each case, the exercise price shall be adjusted by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of common stock so to be offered (or the aggregate initial conversion or exchange price of the convertible or exchangeable securities so to be offered) would purchase at such exercise price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of common stock to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible or exchangeable securities so to be offered are initially convertible or exchangeable). such adjustment shall become effective at the close of business on such record date; provided, however, that, to the extent the shares of common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock) are not delivered, the exercise price shall be readjusted after the expiration of such rights, options, or warrants (but only with respect to warrants exercised after such expiration), to the exercise price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options, or warrants been made upon the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock) actually issued. in case any subscription 3 price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, whose determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. shares of common stock owned by or held for the account of the company or any majority-owned subsidiary shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. (c) in case the company shall distribute to all holders of common stock (including any such distribution made to the stockholders of the company in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the company is the continuing corporation) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (other than cash dividends or distributions and dividends payable in shares of common stock), or rights, options, or warrants to subscribe for or purchase common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock (excluding those with respect to the issuance of which an adjustment of the exercise price is provided pursuant to section 5(b) hereof), then, in each case, the exercise price shall be adjusted by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the exercise price on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, whose determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness or assets so to be distributed, or of such rights, options, or warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, applicable to one share, and the denominator of which shall be such exercise price. such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made, and shall become effective on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. (d) in case the company shall issue shares of common stock or rights, options, or warrants to subscribe for or purchase common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock (excluding shares, rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities issued or issuable (i) in any of the transactions with respect to which an adjustment of the exercise price is provided pursuant to sections 5(a), 5(b), or 5(c) above, (ii) to employees, officers, directors or consultants pursuant to any employee benefit plan or other arrangement or agreement for the primary purpose of soliciting or retaining their services, (iii) upon conversion of the company's series a preferred stock outstanding on the date hereof, or (iv) upon exercise of the warrants or any other rights, options or warrants outstanding on the date hereof), at a price per share (determined, in the case of such rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities, by dividing (x) the total amount received or receivable by the company in consideration of the sale and issuance of such rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities, plus the minimum aggregate consideration payable to the company upon exercise, conversion, or exchange thereof, by (y) the maximum number of shares covered by such rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities) lower than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then the exercise price shall be reduced on the date of such issuance to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus (b) the quotient obtained by dividing the consideration received by the company upon such issuance by such exercise price, and (iv) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issuance. for the purposes of such adjustments, the maximum number of 4 shares which the holders of any such rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities shall be entitled to initially subscribe for or purchase or convert or exchange such securities into shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding as of the date of such issuance, and the consideration received by the company therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the company for such rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities, plus the minimum aggregate consideration or premiums stated in such rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities to be paid for the shares covered thereby. no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of common stock on exercise of such rights, options, or warrants or on conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities. on the expiration or the termination of such rights, options, or warrants, or the termination of such right to convert or exchange, the exercise price shall be readjusted (but only with respect to warrants exercised after such expiration or termination) to such exercise price as would have obtained had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities been made upon the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of common stock actually delivered upon the exercise of such rights, options, or warrants or upon the conversion or exchange of any such securities; and on any change of the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon the exercise of any such rights, options, or warrants or conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities or any change in the consideration to be received by the company upon such exercise, conversion, or exchange, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the exercise price, as then in effect, shall forthwith be readjusted (but only with respect to warrants exercised after such change) to such exercise price as would have been obtained had an adjustment been made upon the issuance of such rights, options, or warrants not exercised prior to such change, or securities not converted or exchanged prior to such change, on the basis of such change. in case the company shall issue shares of common stock or any such rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities for a consideration consisting, in whole or in part, of property other than cash or its equivalent, then the "price per share" and the "consideration received by the company" for purposes of the first sentence of this section 5(d) shall be as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, whose determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. shares of common stock owned by or held for the account of the company or any majority-owned subsidiary shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. (e) in case the vassell warrants shall vest and become exercisable in accordance with their terms at any time after the date the warrants were first issued, then the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be proportionally adjusted so that the holder after such vesting shall be entitled to receive such number of warrant shares equal to twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding common stock taking into account the exercise of all stock options, warrants and rights to acquire shares of common stock outstanding on the date hereof, conversion of all shares of the company's preferred stock outstanding on the date hereof, and exercise of this warrant and that portion of the vassell warrants vested on such date. (f) as used in this warrant, the "current market price" per share of common stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date in question. the closing price for each day shall be the last reported sales price regular way or, in case no such reported sale takes place 5 on such day, the closing bid price regular way, in either case on the principal national securities exchange (including, for purposes hereof, the nasdaq national market) on which the common stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if the common stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the highest reported bid price for the common stock as furnished by the national association of securities dealers, inc. through nasdaq or a similar organization if nasdaq is no longer reporting such information. if on any such date the common stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange and is not quoted by nasdaq or any similar organization, the fair value of a share of common stock on such date, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, whose determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, shall be used. (g) no adjustment in the exercise price shall be required if such adjustment is less than $.05; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this section 5 are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-thousandth of a share, as the case may be. (h) in any case in which this section 5 shall require that an adjustment in the exercise price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the company may elect to defer, until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the holder, if the holder exercised this warrant after such record date, the shares of common stock, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the shares of common stock, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the exercise price in effect prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that the company shall deliver to the holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing the holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. (i) upon each adjustment of the exercise price as a result of the calculations made in sections 5(b), 5(c), 5(d) or 5(e) hereof, this warrant shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted exercise price, that number of shares (calculated to the nearest thousandth) obtained by dividing (a) the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant prior to adjustment of the number of shares by the exercise price in effect prior to adjustment of the exercise price by (b) the exercise price in effect after such adjustment of the exercise price. (j) whenever there shall be an adjustment as provided in this section 5, the company shall promptly cause written notice thereof to be sent by registered mail, postage prepaid, to the holder, at its address as it shall appear in the warrant register, which notice shall be accompanied by an officer's certificate setting forth the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant and the exercise price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and the computation thereof, which officer's certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such adjustment absent manifest error. (k) the company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of common stock or other capital stock of the company upon the exercise of this warrant. if any fraction of a share would be issuable on the exercise of this warrant (or specified portions thereof), the 6 company shall purchase such fraction for an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the exercise price on the date of exercise of this warrant. 6. (a) in case of any consolidation with or merger of the company with or into another corporation (other than a merger or consolidation in which the company is the surviving or continuing corporation), or in case of any sale, lease, or conveyance to another corporation of the property and assets of any nature of the company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, such successor, leasing, or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall (i) execute with the holder an agreement providing that the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive upon exercise of this warrant solely the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities, property, cash, or any combination thereof receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant might have been exercised immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, or conveyance and (ii) make effective provision in its certificate of incorporation or otherwise, if necessary, to effect such agreement. such agreement shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments in section 5. (b) in case of any reclassification or change of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant (other than a change in par value or from no par value to a specified par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination, but including any change in the shares into two or more classes or series of shares), or in case of any consolidation or merger of another corporation into the company in which the company is the continuing corporation and in which there is a reclassification or change (including a change to the right to receive cash or other property) of the shares of common stock (other than a change in par value, or from no par value to a specified par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination, but including any change in the shares into two or more classes or series of shares), the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive upon exercise of this warrant solely the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities, property, cash, or any combination thereof receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, or merger by a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant might have been exercised immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, or merger. thereafter, appropriate provision shall be made for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments in section 5. (c) the above provisions of this section 6 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications and changes of shares of common stock and to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, leases, or conveyances. 7. in case at any time the company shall propose (a) to pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock in shares of common stock or make any other distribution (other than regularly scheduled cash dividends which are not in a greater amount per share than such most recent cash dividend) to all holders of common stock; or 7 (b) to issue any rights, warrants, or other securities to all holders of common stock entitling them to purchase any additional shares of common stock or any other rights, warrants, or other securities; or (c) to effect any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of common stock, or any consolidation, merger, sale, lease, or conveyance of property, described in section 6; or (d) to effect any liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the company; or (e) to take any other action which would cause an adjustment to the exercise price; then, and in any one or more of such cases, the company shall give written notice thereof, by registered mail, postage prepaid, to the holder at the holder's address as it shall appear in the warrant register, mailed at least 15 days prior to (i) the date as of which the holders of record of shares of common stock to be entitled to receive any such dividend, distribution, rights, warrants, or other securities are to be determined, (ii) the date on which any such reclassification, change of outstanding shares of common stock, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance of property, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of record of shares of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities or other property, if any, deliverable upon such reclassification, change of outstanding shares, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance of property, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, or (iii) the date of such action which would require an adjustment to the exercise price. 8. the issuance of any shares of common stock or other securities upon the exercise of this warrant, and the delivery of certificates or other instruments representing such shares or other securities, shall be made without charge to the holder for any tax or other charge in respect of such issuance. the company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the holder and the company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such certificate unless and until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid. 9. the holder shall be entitled to the registration rights with respect to the warrant shares provided for in the registration rights agreement, dated september 12, 2000, between the company and the holder. 10. the warrant shares issued upon exercise of the warrants shall be subject to a stop transfer order and the certificate or certificates evidencing such warrant shares shall bear the following legend: "the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or under any state securities laws. the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or other disposition of the shares represented by 8 this certificate is subject to certain restrictions and conditions specified in a shareholders' agreement, dated as of september 12, 2000, by and among the issuer (the "company"), william c. vassell and the holder, and the company reserves the right to refuse the transfer of such shares until such restrictions and conditions have been fulfilled with respect to such sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or other disposition. a copy of such restrictions and conditions will be furnished by the company to the holders of its capital stock upon written request and without charge." 11. upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of any warrant (and upon surrender of any warrant if mutilated), and upon reimbursement of the company's reasonable incidental expenses, the company shall execute and deliver to the holder thereof a new warrant of like date, tenor, and denomination. 12. the holder of any warrant shall not have, solely on account of such status, any rights of a stockholder of the company, either at law or in equity, or to any notice of meetings of stockholders or of any other proceedings of the company, except as provided in this warrant. 13. the holder is acquiring the warrant as principal for its own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to or for distributing or reselling such warrant or warrant shares or any part thereof. by executing this agreement, the holder

registration rights agreement this registration rights agreement (the "agreement") is made and entered into as of the 12th day of september, 2000, by and among command security corporation, a new york corporation (the "company") and reliance security group plc, a corporation organized under the laws of england and wales (the "holder"). witnesseth: whereas, the holder has agreed to purchase shares (the "shares") of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the company (the "common stock"), shares of series a preferred stock, par value $.0001, per share of the company (the "preferred stock"), and certain of the company's outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock (the "outstanding warrants"), pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "stock purchase agreement") between the holder and certain shareholders of the company; whereas, the company has issued a warrant (the "warrant") to the holder to purchase shares of common stock; and whereas, the company desires to grant to the holder registration rights with respect to the shares purchased; now therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. (a) effectiveness. this agreement shall become effective upon the date of consummation of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement (the "effective date"). in the event the stock purchase agreement is terminated, this agreement shall be null and void. (b) piggyback registration. if, at any time during the five-year period commencing on the effective date, the company shall file a registration statement (other than a registration statement on form s-4, form s-8, or any successor form) with the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") while any registrable securities (as hereinafter defined) are outstanding, the company shall give the holder at least 20 days' prior written notice of the filing of such registration statement. if requested by the holder in writing within 20 days after receipt of any such notice, the company shall, at the company's sole expense (other than the fees and disbursements of counsel for the holder, and the underwriting discounts, if any, payable in respect of the registrable securities sold by the holder), register all or, at the holder's option, any portion of the registrable securities of the holder, concurrently with the registration of such other securities, all to the extent required to permit the public offering and sale of the registrable securities through the facilities of all appropriate securities exchanges, if any, on which the company's common stock is being sold or on the over-the-counter market, and will use its best efforts through its officers, directors, auditors, and counsel to cause such registration statement to become effective as promptly as practicable. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter of any such offering shall determine and advise the company in writing that, in its opinion, the distribution of all or a portion of the registrable securities requested to be included in the registration concurrently with the securities being registered by the company would adversely affect the distribution of such securities by the company for its own account, then the holder shall delay the offering and sale of such registrable securities (or the portions thereof so designated by such managing underwriter) for such period, not to exceed 120 days (the "delay period") as the managing underwriter shall request, provided that no such delay shall be required as to any registrable securities if any securities of the company are included in such registration statement and eligible for sale during the delay period for the account of any person other than the company and holder unless the securities included in such registration statement and eligible for sale during the delay period for such other person shall have been reduced pro rata to the reduction of the registrable securities which were requested to be included and eligible for sale during the delay period in such registration. as used herein, "registrable securities" shall mean (i) the shares of common stock, (ii) the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock, (iii) the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the outstanding warrants and (iv) the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant, which, in each case, have not been previously sold pursuant to a registration statement or rule 144 promulgated under the securities act. (c) demand registration. if, at any time during the five-year period commencing on the effective date, the company shall receive a written request from the holder to register the sale of all or part of such registrable securities, the company shall, as promptly as practicable, at the company's sole cost and expense (other than the fees and disbursements of counsel for the holder and the underwriting discounts, if any, payable in respect of the registrable securities sold by the holder) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement sufficient to permit the public offering and sale of the registrable securities through the facilities of all appropriate securities exchanges, if any, on which the company's common stock is being sold or on the over-the-counter market, and will use its best efforts through its officers, directors, auditors, and counsel to cause such registration statement to become effective as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that the company shall only be obligated to file one such registration statement. the company shall not be obligated to effect any registration of its securities pursuant to this section 1(c) within nine months after the effective date of any previous registration statement prepared and filed in accordance with sections 1(b) or 1(c) (other than a registration statement on forms s-4, s-8 or other successor forms). (d) in the event of a registration pursuant to the provisions of this section 1, the company shall use its best efforts to cause the registrable securities so registered to be registered or qualified for sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the holder may reasonably request; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any state by reason of this section 1(d) in which it is not otherwise required to qualify to do business. (e) the company shall keep effective any registration or qualification contemplated by this section 1 and shall from time to time amend or supplement each applicable registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, application, document and communication for such period of time as shall be required to permit the holder to complete the offer and sale of the registrable securities covered thereby. the company shall in no event be required to keep any such registration or qualification in effect for a period in excess of nine months from the date on which the holder is first free to sell such registrable securities; 2 provided, however, that, if the company is required to keep any such registration or qualification in effect with respect to securities other than the registrable securities beyond such period, the company shall keep such registration or qualification in effect as it relates to the registrable securities for so long as such registration or qualification remains or is required to remain in effect in respect of such other securities. (f) in the event of a registration pursuant to the provisions of this section 1, the company shall furnish to the holder such number of copies of the registration statement and of each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case, including all exhibits) such number of copies of each prospectus contained in such registration statement and each supplement or amendment thereto (including each preliminary prospectus) all of which shall conform to the requirements of the securities act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and such other documents, as any holder may reasonably request to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities included in such registration. (g) in the event of a registration pursuant to the provisions of this section 1, the company shall furnish the holder of any registrable securities so registered with an opinion of its counsel (reasonably acceptable to the holder) to the effect that such counsel has no knowledge of any material misstatement or omission in such registration statement or any prospectus, as amended or supplemented. such opinion shall also state the jurisdictions in which the registrable securities have been registered or qualified for sale pursuant to the provisions of section 1(d) (h) the company shall notify the holder of the registrable securities promptly when such registration statement has become effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such registration statement has been filed. (i) the company shall advise the holder of the registrable securities, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge of the issuance of any stop order by the commission suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and promptly use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued. (j) the company shall promptly notify the holder of the registrable securities at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, and at the reasonable request of the holder of the registrable securities prepare and furnish to them such number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities or securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made.

(c) to provide for just and equitable contribution, if (i) an indemnified party makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to section 2(a) or 2(b) (subject to the limitations thereof) but it is found in a final judicial determination, not subject to further appeal, that such 5 indemnification may not be enforced in such case, even though this agreement expressly provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) any indemnified or indemnifying party seeks contribution under the securities act, the exchange act or otherwise, then the company (including for this purpose any contribution made by or on behalf of any director of the company, any officer of the company who signed any such registration statement, any controlling person of the company, and its or their respective counsel) as one entity, and the holder of the registrable securities, included in such registration in the aggregate (including for this purpose any contribution by or on behalf of an indemnified party), as a second entity, shall contribute to the losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses whatsoever to which any of them may be subject, on the basis of relevant equitable considerations such as the relative fault of the company and the holder in connection with the facts which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses. the relative fault, in the case of an untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission, or alleged omission shall be determined by, among other things, whether such statement, alleged statement, omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the company or by the holder, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, alleged statement, omission, or alleged omission. the company and holder agree that it would be unjust and inequitable if the respective obligations of the company and the holder for contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation of the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses (even if the holder and the other indemnified parties were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not reflect the equitable considerations referred to in this section 2(c). no person guilty of a fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. for purposes of this section 2 (c) each person, if any, who controls the holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20(a) of the exchange act and each officer, director, partner, employee, agent, and counsel of holder or control person shall have the same rights to contribution as the holder or control person and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20(a) of the exchange act, each officer of the company who shall have signed any such registration statement, each director of the company, and its or their respective counsel shall have the same rights to contribution as the company, subject to each case to the provisions of this section 2(c). anything in this section 2(c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no party shall be liable for contribution with respect to the settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent. this section 2(c) is intended to supersede any right to contribution under the securities act, the exchange act or otherwise. 3. miscellaneous.
