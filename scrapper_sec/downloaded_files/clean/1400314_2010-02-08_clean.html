&#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; revised article viii to clarify the terms and procedures for berliner's indemnification of its directors.&#160;&#160;for example, the amended sections provide that, in order to be indemnified by berliner, a director must have acted in good faith and in a manner that such director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of berliner and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, without reasonable cause to believe such director's conduct was unlawful.&#160;&#160;in addition, berliner is not obligated to indemnify directors for claims covered by an insurance policy or other indemnification arrangement;

rank .&#160;&#160;with respect to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of berliner, the berliner series b preferred stock ranks (1) senior to all classes of berliner's common stock;

escrow &#160; pursuant to an escrow agreement, dated as of january 27, 2010, 10,980,000 shares (the &#8220;escrow shares&#8221;) of berliner common stock included in the merger consideration were placed into escrow and will be available for six months after the effective time to satisfy any indemnification claims with respect to any breaches of representations or warranties made by unitek in the merger agreement.&#160;&#160;all voting rights with respect to the escrow shares will be exercised by the company representative (as such term is defined in the merger agreement), on behalf of the former company stockholders, in accordance with instructions provided by the beneficial owners of such shares unless and until the time at which such shares are released to berliner to satisfy indemnification claims as more fully described below. &#160; indemnification &#160; pursuant to the merger agreement, both berliner and unitek made representations and warranties, which survive the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby (the &#8220;closing&#8221;) and terminate six months thereafter.&#160;&#160;as discussed above, any indemnification claims with respect to any breaches of representations or warranties made by unitek in the merger agreement will be supported solely by shares of berliner common stock held in escrow, which shares will be cancelled in the event of a successful indemnification claim.&#160;&#160;any indemnification claims with respect to any breaches of representations or warranties made by berliner in the merger agreement will be payable solely by way of issuance of up to 10,980,000 shares of additional berliner common stock to holders of unitek common stock (on a pro-rata basis) in the event of a successful indemnification claim.&#160;&#160;the number of shares of berliner common stock canceled or issued in the event of a successful indemnification claim as mentioned above will equal the total amount of the indemnification claim divided by the market value (as such term is defined in the &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; merger agreement) of each share of berliner common stock.&#160;&#160;no indemnification claim may be made with respect to berliner or unitek by an indemnified party until the aggregate amount of losses for which all indemnified parties seeking to be indemnified by berliner or unitek, respectively, exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate.&#160;&#160;the limitation in the immediately preceding sentence will not apply to claims relating to breaches of either party's representations relating to working capital or fraud. &#160; credit support agreement &#160; in connection with the merger, berliner and unitek (collectively, the &#8220;obligors&#8221;) entered into a credit support agreement (the &#8220;credit support agreement&#8221;) with sector performance fund and spf (collectively, the&#160;&#8220;credit support parties&#8221;), whereby the obligors will pay the credit support parties a credit support fee (the&#160;&#8220;credit support fee&#8221;) in exchange for the credit support parties&#8217; continued guaranty of unitek&#8217;s performance under its credit facility with bmo capital markets financing, inc. (the &#8220;bmo loan&#8221;).&#160;&#160;the credit support fee is equal to 6% (or the maximum contract rate of interest permitted by law if less than 6%) (the &#8220;stated rate&#8221;) on the aggregate of the outstanding principal amount and interest payable under the bmo loan.&#160;&#160;the credit support fee will be paid quarterly in arrears in cash, or, at the option of berliner (and for so long as the special committee exists, with the consent of the special committee), in shares of berliner series b preferred stock which will be issued quarterly; provided, that if the unitek credit agreements (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) do not permit the payment of the credit support fee in cash, then such fee will be paid in shares of berliner series b preferred stock. &#160; if either credit support party is required to perform its obligations under the guaranty, the obligors will enter into a loan facility with the credit support parties on substantially the same terms as the bmo loan (the&#160;&#8220;sector loan facility&#8221;).&#160;&#160;the principal amount of the sector loan facility will equal the amount of the guaranty funded by the credit support parties and the interest rate will be equal to 8% (or the maximum contract rate of interest permitted by law if less than 8%), plus the rate previously applicable to the bmo loan.&#160;&#160;the interest payable under the sector loan facility will be paid in arrears in cash, or, at the option of berliner (and for so long as the special committee exists, with the consent of the special committee), in shares of berliner series b preferred stock which will be issued quarterly; provided, that if the unitek credit agreements do not permit the payment of such interest in cash, then such interest will be paid in shares of berliner series b preferred stock.&#160;&#160;during the nine-month period following the establishment of a sector loan facility, the obligors must use commercially reasonable efforts to repay the principal amount and interest payable under the sector loan facility.&#160;&#160;any principal or interest payable under the sector loan facility not repaid on or before the end of such nine-month period will automatically convert into shares of berliner series b preferred stock. &#160; except to the extent specifically prohibited by the merger agreement or any agreement contemplated thereby, each of the reporting persons reserves the right, in light of its ongoing evaluation of berliner&#8217;s financial condition, business, operations and prospects, the market price of berliner common stock, conditions in the securities markets generally, general economic and industry conditions, its business objectives and other relevant factors, to change its plans and intentions at any time, as it deems appropriate.&#160;&#160;in particular, any one or more of the reporting persons (and their respective affiliates) reserves the right, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the agreements contemplated thereby and any applicable law, to, among other things, (i)&#160;purchase additional shares of berliner common stock or other securities of berliner, (ii) sell or transfer berliner common stock, berliner preferred stock or other securities beneficially owned by them from time to time in public or private transactions, (iii)&#160;cause any of the reporting persons to distribute in kind to their respective partners or members, as the case may be, shares of berliner common stock, berliner preferred stock or other securities owned by such entities, and (iv) consider participating in a business combination transaction that would result in an acquisition of all of berliner&#8217;s capital stock.&#160;&#160;additionally, as a result of their holding, directly or indirectly, shares of berliner common stock and berliner preferred stock representing approximately 78.75% of berliner&#8217;s voting stock, the reporting persons may have the ability to influence or determine the vote with respect to significant matters involving berliner, including the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d.&#160;&#160;furthermore, messrs.&#160;brodsky, colonnetta and hopkin, each an officer of ultimate gp, serve on the board, and in such capacity may have the ability, on behalf of the reporting persons, to influence the management policies and control of berliner with the aim of increasing the value of berliner, and as a result, the reporting persons&#8217;
