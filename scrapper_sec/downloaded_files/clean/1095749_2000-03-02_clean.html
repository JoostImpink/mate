(iii) no contesting. if the investor group shall take any such action permitted by this section 3(b), the company agrees that it shall not in any way (whether by active opposition, board announcement or otherwise) contest such action, subject in all events to the fiduciary obligations of the company's board and officers to the company's stockholders. - 8 - (c) option to purchase incremental shares.

(iii) adjustment for failure to exercise option. in the event that the company or its designee fails to exercise its option as provided in section 3(c)(i), the threshold percentage shall be increased to a percentage equal to the percentage of the voting power held by the investor group upon the expiration of the right to exercise such option by the company or such designee. (iv) voting of incremental shares. until the incremental shares shall have been disposed of as provided in section 3(c)(ii) and, if applicable, the option of the company or its designee provided in section 3(c)(i) shall have expired, the incremental shares shall be voted in a manner proportionate to shares voted by the shareholders of the company other than the investor group and the permitted transferees. -9- (v) no circumvention.
