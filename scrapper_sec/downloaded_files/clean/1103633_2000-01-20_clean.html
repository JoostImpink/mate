and limitations of series b preferred stock of biosource international, inc. _____________________________ (pursuant to section 151 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware) biosource international, inc., a corporation organized and existing under the general corporation law of the state of delaware (the "corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of section 151(g) thereof: hereby certifies: that pursuant to the authority conferred upon the board of directors by the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, the board of directors on january 8, 2000 adopted the following resolution creating a series of 500,000 of preferred stock designated as series b preferred stock: resolved, that there is hereby designated a series of preferred stock to be known as series b preferred stock, $.001 par value per share, having the following rights and preferences: 1. designation of shares. the designation of this initial series of preferred --------------------- shares is "series b preferred stock, par value $.001 per share." 2. number of shares. the number of shares constituting the series b ---------------- preferred stock shall be 500,000 (each referred to as a "series b share" and collectively as the "series b shares"). 3. dividend rights. commencing on the date of issuance, the holder of record --------------- of each series b share of the corporation (a "holder") shall be entitled to be credited with a non-cash dividend (a "dividend") on january 1 of each year (a "dividend payment date"), in additional series b shares at the dividend rate (as defined below) for each annual payment period that such series b share is outstanding. an "annual payment period" shall mean each of the twelve-month periods ending on december 31 of each year (or such shorter period commencing on the date of issuance and ending on december 31). the first dividend payment date shall be january 1, 2001. the "dividend rate" shall mean eight percent (8%) of the original issuance price (as defined below) plus all dividends paid in any prior annual payment period. dividends shall accrue (whether or not paid) during each annual payment period from the date on which such annual payment period commences to the last day of such annual payment period, or if any conversion or liquidation occurs prior thereto, pro rata through the date of conversion or liquidation. for purposes of this certificate of designation, "original issuance price" shall mean the price per share at which the series b shares are first issued to any holder. unless all dividends on the outstanding series b shares that shall have accrued and become payable as of any date shall have been paid, or declared and funds set apart for payment thereof, no dividend or other distribution (payable other than in common stock or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of common stock of the corporation), shall be paid to the holders of common stock. 4. liquidation. ----------- 4.1. preference. in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding- ---------- up, whether voluntary or involuntary, of the corporation ("liquidation"), but not upon the conversion of series b shares: 4.1.1. first, the holder of a series b share shall be entitled to receive with respect to each series b share, after the satisfaction of all distributions to holders of other series of preferred stock, if any, which are required (at the direction of the holder thereof or otherwise) to be redeemed prior to or in connection with the consummation of such liquidation or which are expressly senior in liquidation preference to the series b shares including, without limitation, any series of preferred stock which is mandatorily redeemable (collectively, the "senior payments") but before any distribution is made to or set aside for the holders of common stock or any other series of preferred stock of the corporation, if any, which are not then required to be redeemed or which are junior in liquidation preference to the series b shares, cash or any other assets of the corporation in an amount (or having a fair market value) equal to the original issuance price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) ("liquidation preference") plus all accrued but unpaid dividends which have been added to the liquidation preference of such shares pursuant to section 3 up to the --------- date of the final distribution in liquidation. if, after the satisfaction of all senior payments, the assets of the corporation available for distribution to the holders of series b shares shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full of the amount due to the holders of series b shares pursuant to this section 4, the entire assets of the --------- corporation available for distribution to such holders after the satisfaction of all senior payments shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the series b shares and the holders of other series of preferred stock which are not junior in liquidation 2 preferences to the series b shares, if any, in accordance with their respective liquidation preferences. the fair market value of any assets of the corporation and the proportion of cash and other assets distributed by the corporation to the holders of the series b shares shall be reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors. 4.1.2. then, if assets or surplus funds remain, all or an appropriate portion of such remaining assets and surplus funds shall be distributed to the holders of any other class or series of preferred stock of the corporation having a liquidation preference over the common stock to the extent of, and in accordance with, such preference. 4.1.3. then, if assets or surplus funds remain, all of such remaining assets and surplus funds shall be distributed to the holders of the common stock. 4.2. merger; sale. the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ------------ the corporation, or the acquisition of the corporation by another entity by means of merger, consolidation, share exchange, reorganization or otherwise pursuant to which shares of capital stock of the corporation are converted into cash, securities or other property of the acquiring entity or any of its affiliates shall be regarded as a liquidation within the meaning of this section (excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the corporation); provided, however, that each holder of a series b share shall have the right to elect the conversion benefits of the provisions of section 5 or other --------- applicable conversion provisions in lieu of receiving payment in liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation pursuant to this section; provided, further, that this provision shall not apply if the holders of voting securities of the corporation immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, share exchange, reorganization or sale of assets, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, a majority of the combined voting power of the surviving entity resulting from such merger, consolidation, share exchange, reorganization or sale of assets; provided, however, that shares of the surviving entity held by holders of the capital stock of the corporation acquired by means other than the exchange or conversion of the capital stock of the corporation for shares of the surviving entity shall not be used in determining if the stockholders of the corporation own a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity (or its parent), but shall be used for determining the total outstanding voting power of such entity. 5. conversion rights. the holders of series b shares shall have conversion ----------------- rights as follows (the "conversion rights"): 5.1. right to convert. each series b share shall be convertible, at the ---------------- option of the holder, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully 3 paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as is determined by: (a) dividing the original issuance price plus all accrued but unpaid dividends which have been added to the original issuance price of such shares pursuant to section 3 up to the date of such conversion --------- by a conversion price (such amount is referred to as the "conversion price"), determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion (b) multiplied by four (4) (such product of (a) and (b) is referred to as the "conversion rate"). the initial conversion price per share for the series b shares shall be the original issuance price; provided, however, that the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in section 5.4. ----------- 5.2. automatic conversion. each series b share shall automatically be -------------------- converted into shares of common stock at the conversion rate at the time in effect immediately upon (i) consummation of the corporation's sale of its common stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, in which the public offering price is not less than $15.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions) and which results in proceeds to the corporation of at least $40,000,000 in the aggregate before deduction of commissions, discounts and expenses (a "qualified offering") or, (ii) the date specified by written notice from the corporation to the holders of the then outstanding series b shares if the market price of a common share receivable upon such conversion shall exceed $20.00, or (iii) if not sooner converted, each series b share shall automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the conversion rate at the time in effect immediately upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding series b shares. market price for the purpose of this section 5.2 shall mean the last reported sale price regular way ----------- for 20 consecutive trading days within 30 days of the date of the notice of conversion on the principal national securities exchange or quotation system on which the common stock is traded (including for purposes hereof, the nasdaq national market system). 5.3. mechanics of conversion. before any holder of series b shares shall ----------------------- be entitled to convert the same into shares of common stock (other than by an automatic conversion pursuant to section 5.2), the holder ----------- shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for the series b shares, and shall give written notice to the corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock are to be issued. the corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of series b shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. such conversion shall be 4 deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the series b shares to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock as of such date. if the conversion is in connection with an event specified in section 5.2, the conversion may, at the option of any holder ----------- tendering series b shares for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of the event specified therein, in which event the persons entitled to receive the common stock upon conversion of the series b shares shall not be deemed to have converted such series b shares until immediately prior to the closing of such transaction. 5.4. conversion price adjustments for certain dilutive issuances, splits ------------------------------------------------------------------- and combinations. the conversion price of the series b shares shall ---------------- be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 5.4.1. adjustment with respect to additional stock issuances ----------------------------------------------------- 5.4.1.1. if the corporation shall issue any additional stock (as defined below) for no consideration or for a consideration per share less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such additional stock divided by four (4), the conversion price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this section 5.4.1) be adjusted to a ------------- price determined by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of common stock deemed to be issued pursuant to section 5.4.1.5.1 or 5.4.1.5.2) plus the number of ------------------------------ shares of common stock that the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for such issuance would purchase at such conversion price divided by four (4); and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of common stock deemed to be issued pursuant to section 5.4.1.5.1 or 5.4.1.5.2) ----------------- --------- plus the number of shares of such additional stock. 5.4.1.2. no adjustment of the conversion price for the series b shares shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made 5 prior to three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. except to the limited extent provided for in sections 5.4.4 and 5.5, no -------------- --- adjustment of such conversion price pursuant to this section 5.4.1 shall have the effect of increasing ------------ the conversion price above the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. 5.4.1.3. in the case of the issuance of common stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. 5.4.1.4. in the case of the issuance of the common stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the board of directors; provided, however, that if the consideration consists of securities, the fair market value of such securities shall be valued as follows: 5.4.1.4.1. if traded on a securities exchange or through the nasdaq national market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; 5.4.1.4.2. if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty (30) day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and 5.4.1.4.3. if there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the corporation. 5.4.1.5. in the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the applicable purchase date (as defined below)) of options to 6 purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this section 5.4.1 ------------- and section 5.4.2: ------------- 5.4.1.5.1. the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to the right to exercise, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in sections 5.4.1.3 and ---------------- 5.4.1.4), if any, received by the ------- corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the common stock covered thereby. 5.4.1.5.2. the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by 7 the corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in sections 5.4.1.3 and 5.4.1.4). ---------------- ------- 5.4.1.5.3. in the event of any change in the number of shares of common stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the corporation upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof (unless such options or rights or convertible or exchangeable securities were merely deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of section 5.4.1.1), the conversion price --------------- of the series b shares, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of common stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities. 5.4.1.5.4. upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the conversion price of the series b shares, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities (unless such options or rights were merely deemed to be included in the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the number of shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of section ------- 5.4.1.1), shall be recomputed to reflect ------- the issuance of only the number of shares of common stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that 8 remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities. 5.4.1.5.5. the number of shares of common stock deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to sections 5.4.1.5.1 and 5.4.1.5.2 shall ------------------ --------- be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in either section ------- 5.4.1.5.3 or 5.4.1.5.4. --------- --------- 5.4.2. "additional stock" shall mean any shares of common stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to section ------- 5.4.1.5) by the corporation after the date of the first ------- issuance of series b preferred stock (the "purchase date") other than: 5.4.2.1. common stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in section 5.4.3 or 5.5 hereof; ------------- --- 5.4.2.2. common stock (or securities exercisable or convertible into common stock) issuable or issued to employees, consultants or directors of the corporation after the purchase date directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan approved by the board of directors of the corporation; 5.4.2.3. securities issued pursuant to the conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities outstanding or deemed outstanding on the purchase date; and 5.4.2.4. securities issued or issuable in connection with the acquisition, merger, consolidation, or other business combination by or of the corporation with, by, or of any person. 5.4.3. in the event the corporation should at any time or from time to time fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock or the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of common stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of common stock (hereinafter referred to as "common stock equivalents") without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of common stock or the common stock equivalents (including the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), 9 then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the conversion price of the series b shares shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each series b share shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of common stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such common stock equivalents. 5.4.4. if the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any time after the purchase date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of common stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the conversion price for the series b shares shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each series b share shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares. 5.5. recapitalizations. if at any time or from time to time there shall be ----------------- a recapitalization of the common stock (other than a subdivision or combination provided for elsewhere in this section 5) provision shall --------- be made so that the holders of the series b shares shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such series b shares the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of common stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section 5 with respect to the rights of the --------- holders of the series b shares after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this section 5 (including adjustment of the --------- conversion price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the series b shares) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. 5.6. no impairment. the corporation will not, by amendment of its ------------- certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this section 5 and in the taking of all such --------- action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the series b shares against impairment. 5.7. no fractional shares and certificate as to adjustments. ------------------------------------------------------ 10 5.7.1. no fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any series b share, and the number of shares of common stock to be issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of series b shares the holder is at the time converting into common stock and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon such aggregate conversion. 5.7.2. upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the conversion price of the series b shares pursuant to this section 5, the corporation, at its expense, shall promptly --------- compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of series b shares a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. 5.8. reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. the corporation shall --------------------------------------------- at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the series b shares, such number of its shares of common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding series b shares; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding series b shares, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holders of series b shares, the corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of common stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the certificate of incorporation. 5.9. notices. any notice required by the provisions of this section 5 to ------- --------- be given to the holders of shares of series b shares shall be deemed given if deposited in the united states first class mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at such holder's address appearing on the books of the corporation. each such notice or other communication shall be treated as effective or having been given when delivered, if delivered personally, or, if sent by facsimile, upon the sender's receipt of confirmation, or, if sent by mail, at the earlier of its receipt or five (5) days after the same has been deposited in a regularly maintained receptacle for the deposit of the united states mail, addressed and postage prepaid as aforesaid. 5.10. payment of taxes. the corporation will pay all issue or other taxes ---------------- (other than taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be 11 imposed with respect to the issue or delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of shares of series b preferred stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of common stock in a name other than that in which the shares of series b preferred stock so converted were registered. 5.11. notices of record date. in the event of any taking by the corporation ---------------------- of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the corporation shall mail to each holder of series b shares, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right. 5.12. registrations and approvals. if any shares of common stock which --------------------------- would be issuable upon conversion of the series b shares hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares may be issued upon conversion, the corporation will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible cause such shares to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. the corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to list the shares of (or depository shares representing fractional interests in) common stock required to be delivered upon conversion of such series b shares prior to such delivery upon the principal national securities exchange or quotation system upon which the outstanding common stock is listed or eligible for trading at the time of such delivery, if any. 6. voting rights. subject to the rights of series of preferred stock that may ------------- from time to time come into existence, the holders of outstanding series b shares shall have the right to vote, together with the holders of all the outstanding shares of common stock and not by classes, except as otherwise provided herein or as required by the general corporation law of the state of delaware, on all matters on which the holders of outstanding shares of common stock shall have the right to vote. subject to the foregoing, for each one issued and outstanding series b share held of record by a holder, such holder shall have the right to vote the number of shares of common stock into which a series b share is then convertible. fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which series b shares held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward). 7. redemption rights. ----------------- 12 7.1.1 redemption generally. subject to section 7.1.2, at any time after -------------------- the date (the "redemption anniversary date") which is four (4) years from the first issuance of series b shares, at the written request (the "redemption request") of any holder of series b shares executed and delivered to the corporation, the corporation shall, on the date which is forty-five (45) days following its receipt of such redemption request (or, if such date is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day) (the "redemption date"), be obligated to redeem at a price per share equal to the series b redemption price (as defined below) of such shares, all of the holder's series b shares which are outstanding on such redemption date. the redemption of each series b share shall be made at a price equal to the original issue price for such share plus all accrued but unpaid dividends on such share up to and including the redemption date (the "series b redemption price"). the period from the date of issuance through the redemption anniversary date is referred to herein as the "redemption period." 7.1.2 change in redemption period; average market price. if the average --------------------------- -------------------- market price (as defined below) of a share of common stock during any test period (as defined below) is less than the conversion price then in effect divided by four, then the redemption period shall be reduced by one (1) year; provided that if the date on which the average market price is determined is less than one (1) year prior to the redemption anniversary date, then the redemption period shall be reduced such that the redemption anniversary date shall be the date of such determination; and provided further once the redemption anniversary date has occurred, no
