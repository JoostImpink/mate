(ii) not to tender any of the subject shares in response to a tender offer by any third party (other than vs&a and its affiliates); (iii) not to transfer or permit the transfer of any of the subject shares to a third party transferee unless as a condition of such transfer the third party transferee executes an agreement substantially in the form of the voting agreements; and (iv) not to grant any proxy or power of attorney or similar authorization with respect to any of the subject shares or to take any other action that is inconsistent with or that would limit or interfere with the stockholder"s obligations under the voting agreement. pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the purchaser agreed to (i) commence an offer to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock (the "shares") at a price of $29.00 per share and (ii) as soon as practical after the consummation of (page 10 of 15) 11 the offer, consummate the merger. upon consummation of the offer, the parties to the merger agreement will take all necessary action to effect the merger. if the offer is not consummated, the company will call a meeting of its stockholders to vote upon the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. upon the merger, the separate corporate existence of the purchaser will cease and the company will be the surviving corporation of the merger (the "surviving corporation"). upon the filing of the certificate of merger or a certificate of ownership and merger with the secretary of state of the state of delaware or upon such later date as set forth in section 251 or section 253 of the delaware general corporation law ("dgcl") (such date and time being the "effective time"), (i) each share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (except for shares covered under (ii) below) will be converted into the right to receive $29.00 in cash (the "merger consideration"); (ii) each share in the company's treasury and shares owned by vs&a, the purchaser or any subsidiary of vs&a or the company will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment made with respect thereto; and (iii) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the surviving corporation. at the effective time, each option to purchase shares of common stock will be cancelled, and the former holder will have the right to receive from the company during the 10-day period following the consummation of the merger an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration applicable to the number of shares of common stock subject to such option, which will be deemed to be fully vested as of the effective time, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such option, less any income or employment tax withholding required under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or any provision of state or local law. at the effective time, each warrant to purchase shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration applicable to the number of shares of common stock subject to such warrants over (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such warrants. shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time that are held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of the merger and who have demanded an appraisal in accordance with section 262 of the dgcl (collectively, the "dissenting shares") will not be converted into or represent the right to receive the merger consideration. such stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of common stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of section 262 of the dgcl, except that all dissenting shares held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such dissenting shares under section 262 will be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, and to have become exchangeable for, the merger consideration, without any interest thereon. (page 11 of 15) 12 at the effective time, the board of directors and the officers of the purchaser will be the board of directors and initial officers, respectively, of the surviving corporation. at the effective time, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will be amended and restated to read as the certificate of incorporation of the purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, and the bylaws of the purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the effective time will become the bylaws of the surviving corporation. the purchase of the shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of holders of shares and the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly. the shares are currently quoted and traded through the nasdaq national market ("nasdaq"), which constitutes the principal trading market for the shares. depending upon the aggregate market value and the number of shares outstanding following the offer, the shares may no longer meet the standards for continued listing on nasdaq. the shares are currently registered under the exchange act. such registration may be terminated upon application of the company to the securities and exchange commission if such shares are not listed on a national securities exchange and there are fewer than 300 holders of record of the shares. if the shares were no longer registered under the exchange act, the shares would no longer qualify for listing on nasdaq. vs&a and the purchaser intend to cause the company to make an application for termination of registration of the shares as soon as possible after consummation of the offer if the shares are then eligible for such termination. upon completion of the offer and the merger, vs&a intends to conduct a detailed review of the company and its assets, corporate structure, capitalization, operations, policies, management and personnel. after such review, vs&a will determine what actions, if any, would be desirable in

of additional securities of the company, or the disposition of securities of the company; (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the

of the company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company; (vi) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure; (vii) changes in the company's charter, by-laws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person; (viii) causing a class of securities of the company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (ix) a class of equity securities of the company (page 12 of 15) 13 becoming

(b) promptly after the effective time, the paying agent shall mail to each record holder of dtn certificates a (i) letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the dtn certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the dtn certificates to the paying agent) (the "letter of transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering such dtn certificates in exchange for payment therefor. upon the surrender of each such dtn certificate, together with the respective letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the paying agent shall pay the holder of such dtn certificate the merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares of dtn common stock formerly represented by such dtn certificate, in consideration therefor, and such dtn certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. until so surrendered, each such dtn certificate (other than the dtn certificates representing dissenting shares and the dtn certificates representing shares of dtn common stock owned by acquiror or merger sub or any subsidiary of acquiror or held in the treasury by dtn or by any wholly owned subsidiary of dtn) shall represent solely the right to receive the aggregate merger consideration relating thereto. no interest or dividends shall be paid or accrued on the merger consideration. if the merger consideration (or any portion thereof) is to be paid to any person other than the person in whose name the dtn certificate formerly representing shares of dtn common stock surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such payment that the dtn certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person surrendering such dtn certificate shall pay to the paying agent any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the merger consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the dtn certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the surviving corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. (c) at any time following the six-month anniversary of the effective time, the surviving corporation shall be entitled to require the paying agent to deliver to the surviving corporation any funds which had been made available to the paying agent and not disbursed to holders of shares of dtn common stock (including all interest and other income received by the paying agent in respect of all funds made available to it), the dtn certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the merger, and the paying agent's duties shall terminate. thereafter, each holder of a dtn certificate formerly representing shares of dtn common stock may surrender such dtn certificate to the surviving corporation and receive in consideration therefor the aggregate merger consideration relating thereto, without any interest or dividends thereon. notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the surviving corporation nor the paying agent shall be liable to any holder of a share of dtn common stock for any merger consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. 10 10 (d) at the close of business on the day of the effective time, the stock transfer books of dtn shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving corporation of any shares of dtn common stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, dtn certificates formerly representing shares of dtn common stock are presented to the surviving corporation or the paying agent, they shall be surrendered and cancelled in return for the payment of the aggregate merger consideration relating thereto, subject to applicable law in the case of dissenting shares. from and after the effective time, the holders of shares of dtn common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of dtn common stock, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. (e) the surviving corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of shares of dtn common stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. to the extent that amounts are so withheld by the surviving corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of dtn common stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the surviving corporation, except that such treatment shall not apply to any withholding tax imposed by any foreign jurisdiction. (f) if any dtn certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such dtn certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the surviving corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the surviving corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such dtn certificate, the paying agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed dtn certificate the merger consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to this agreement. section 3.3 stock options and warrants. (a) at the effective time, each option to purchase shares of dtn common stock and each stock appreciation right with respect to dtn common stock outstanding and unexercised as of the effective time (a "dtn option"), whether granted pursuant to dtn's 1999 stock incentive plan, dtn's stock option plan of 1989, or dtn's non-employee directors stock option plan, as each of the same may have been amended from time to time (collectively, the "dtn stock plans"), or granted by dtn other than pursuant to the dtn stock plans, shall, at the effective time, be cancelled and the former holder shall have the right to receive from dtn in consideration of such cancellation, payable during the ten-day period following the closing date, an amount of cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration applicable to the number of shares of dtn common stock subject to such dtn option, which for this purpose shall be deemed to be fully vested as of the effective time, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such dtn option, less any income or employment tax withholding required under the code or any provision of state or local law. (b) at the effective time, each of the dtn warrants (as defined in section 11 11 4.3) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash, payable in accordance with section 3.2(b), equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration applicable to the number of shares of dtn common stock subject to such dtn warrants over (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such dtn warrants. section 3.4 shares of dissenting holders of dtn common stock.

ex-99.3 4 voting agreement 1 exhibit 3 voting agreement this voting agreement dated as of february 17, 2000 (this "agreement"), is entered into by the undersigned stockholder ("stockholder") of data transmission network corporation, a delaware corporation ("dtn"), and vs&a communications partners iii, l.p., a delaware limited partnership ("acquiror"). recitals a. as of the date of this agreement, stockholder is the owner of the number of shares of the common stock, par value $0.001, of dtn ("dtn common stock") as is set forth below stockholder's name on the signature page of this agreement (the "subject shares"). b. acquiror is contemplating the acquisition of dtn by means of a cash tender offer for up to 100% of the outstanding shares of dtn common stock at a price of $29.00 per share (the "tender offer"), followed by a cash merger, if necessary, to acquire all of the remaining shares of outstanding dtn common stock (the "merger"), all pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger between acquiror and dtn (the "merger agreement"). c. acquiror is unwilling to initiate the tender offer unless holders of greater than 50.1% of the outstanding dtn common stock enter into an agreement substantially in the form of this agreement. now, therefore, in consideration of the covenants and agreements of the parties herein contained, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and as an inducement to acquiror to initiate the tender offer, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: section 1. representations and warranties. stockholder represents and warrants that as of the date hereof he owns the subject shares and that wallace r. weitz & company, investment adviser to the stockholder, has the sole voting power with respect to the subject shares and the sole power to dispose of the subject shares. section 2. tender or voting of subject shares.
