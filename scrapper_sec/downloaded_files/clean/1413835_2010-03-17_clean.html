charter, and may result in the acquisition of additional shares of common stock by the reporting persons. the reporting persons may review the issuer&#146;s operating, management, business affairs,

opportunities fund (the &#147;restated financing agreement&#148;). a closing under the restated financing agreement occurred on march 17, 2010 (the &#147;first closing date&#148;). pursuant to the terms of the restated financing agreement, the credit opportunities fund surrendered the original notes and acquired the convertible note (as defined and discussed below). the restated financing agreement amended and restated and replaced (without constituting a novation) that certain financing agreement (the &#147;initial financing agreement&#148;), dated as of september 30, 2008, by and among the issuer, vpm, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the funds, as amended pursuant to that certain omnibus amendment agreement, dated as of october 19, 2009, by and among the issuer, vpm and the funds (the &#147;omnibus amendment&#148;). the initial financing agreement was disclosed on a current report on form 8-k filed by the issuer with the securities and exchange commission (&#147;sec&#148;) on october 6, 2008 (the &#147;original 8-k&#148;), and the omnibus amendment was disclosed on a current report on form 8-k filed by the issuer with the sec on october 20, 2009. in connection with the restated financing agreement, the issuer, vpm and the credit opportunities fund have executed a master reaffirmation and amendment to transaction documents (the &#147;master reaffirmation&#148;) to acknowledge and reaffirm that the transaction documents entered into, and the liens and security interests granted, in connection with the initial financing agreement (including, but not limited to, the initial financing agreement, a pledge cusip no. 904753100 13d page 10 of 15 pages and security agreement, related intellectual property security agreements and a mortgage), secure the obligations (defined therein) of the issuer under the initial financing agreement, as amended and restated and increased pursuant to the restated financing agreement. upon the terms of the restated financing agreement, on the first closing date, the credit opportunities fund purchased (by way of surrender of the existing original notes, in an outstanding aggregate principal amount of approximately $19,357,980, and by way of cash payment of approximately $13,642,020) a three-year senior secured convertible note, in the principal amount of $33 million, from the issuer, in the form attached as exhibit a to the restated financing agreement (the &#147;convertible note&#148;). in addition, pursuant to the restated financing agreement, the issuer may request that the credit opportunities fund issue up to an additional $3 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes at one subsequent closing (the &#147;subsequent closing&#148;), which shall be no later than the second anniversary of the first closing date; provided , however , that neither the credit opportunities fund, nor any other lender party to the restated financing agreement, shall be required to purchase convertible notes at the subsequent closing unless such lender has, in its sole discretion, agreed in writing, in response to such request of the issuer, to such purchase. the issuer made a payment to vpm in the amount of $660,000 on the first closing date, payable with the proceeds from the sale of the convertible note in respect of an issuance fee. convertible notes each convertible note will accrue interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date issued through the date such convertible note is paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate plus 5% and (ii) 15%, which, in the absence of an event of default (as defined therein), shall be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance of such convertible note on each anniversary of the date of issuance other than the maturity date. pursuant to the terms of the restated financing agreement, the master reaffirmation and related security agreements, account control agreement and mortgage, the convertible notes are secured by a first priority lien on all current and future assets of the issuer. the convertible notes are convertible into shares of common stock at the holder&#146;s option upon the earliest of (a) the first anniversary of the date of issuance, (b) the earliest date on which the issuer is required under the convertible note to provide to the holder prior written notice of its intention to consummate, or the occurrence of, a fundamental transaction (as defined in the convertible notes), (c) the issuer&#146;s delivery of the redemption notice (as defined below) and (d) an event of default. the initial conversion rate, which is subject to adjustment as set forth in the convertible notes, is calculated by dividing the sum of the principal to be converted, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, by $0.70 per share. after the one-year anniversary of the first closing date, under certain circumstances, the issuer has the right, at its option, by delivery of written notice to each of the holders of the convertible notes (the &#147;redemption notice&#148;) at least 60 days prior to the proposed date of redemption (the &#147;redemption date&#148;) to redeem the lesser of $13,642,472.50 and the then outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes (but not more or less than such amount) at a price equal to 110% of the unpaid outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such principal amount; provided , however that a holder of a convertible note may elect, by cusip no. 904753100 13d page 11 of 15 pages written notice delivered to the issuer at any time during the period commencing on the date of delivery of the redemption notice and ending immediately prior to the redemption date, to convert all or any portion of the principal amount of its convertible note (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon), which the issuer elects to redeem into shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of such convertible note, in which event the principal amount of such convertible note so converted shall not be redeemed. as of the first closing date, the issuer lacked sufficient shares of common stock to deliver all of the conversion shares, and, accordingly, the issuer is required to seek stockholder approval to amend its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares. assuming that the stockholder approval discussed in the foregoing paragraph had been obtained and that the entire outstanding principal amount of the convertible note were currently convertible and were converted as of the date hereof, at the initial conversion price of $0.70 per share of common stock, the issuer would be obligated to issue to the credit opportunities fund an aggregate of approximately 47,142,857 shares of common stock, which, when added to the subject shares and the 92,141,951 shares of common stock outstanding as of march 16, 2010, would represent in the aggregate approximately 40.1% of the outstanding shares of common stock. amended and restated registration rights agreement in connection with the restated financing agreement, the issuer and the credit opportunities fund entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement, dated as of the first closing date (the &#147;restated registration rights agreement&#148;), which amended and restated that certain registration rights agreement, dated as of september 30, 2008, by and among the issuer and the funds, that was filed previously by the issuer with the sec on the original 8-k. the restated registration rights agreement provides the credit opportunities fund with certain rights to require the issuer to file with the sec a registration statement covering the resale of all shares of common stock currently held by, or acquirable upon conversion of securities held by, the reporting persons or their affiliates, including (i) the original shares, (ii) the exchange shares and (iii) the shares of common stock to be issued to the holders of the convertible notes upon conversion of the convertible notes (the &#147;conversion shares&#148;). as of the first closing date, the issuer lacked sufficient shares of common stock to deliver all of the conversion shares and the issuer is required to obtain stockholder approval to amend its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares. reaffirmation of affiliate subordination agreement the issuer entered into a reaffirmation of affiliate subordination agreement (the &#147;subordination reaffirmation&#148;) by and among the issuer, jean levy, jaynjean levy family limited partnership (the &#147;partnership&#148;) and vpm, as required under the terms of the restated financing agreement. pursuant to the terms of the subordination reaffirmation, repayment of the issuer&#146;s existing indebtedness payable in favor of jean levy, to whom jay levy previously transferred and assigned his issuer notes, and the partnership, which is evidenced by secured promissory notes (the &#147;existing notes&#148;) that were previously filed by the issuer with the sec on the original 8-k, remain subordinated to the indebtedness payable in favor of the credit opportunities fund in accordance with the terms and conditions of the original affiliate cusip no. 904753100 13d page 12 of 15 pages subordination agreement, which the issuer, the original subordinated creditors and vpm entered into on september 30, 2008. simultaneously with entering into the subordination reaffirmation, the issuer and the holders of the existing notes amended and restated the existing notes to modify the terms thereof. amendment to rights agreement on march 16, 2010, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the restated financing agreement (the &#147;transaction&#148;), the issuer and registrar and transfer company, as rights agent (the &#147;rights agent&#148;), entered into a first amendment (the &#147;rights amendment&#148;) to the rights agreement dated as of december 20, 2002 (the &#147;rights agreement&#148;), between the issuer and the rights agent, in order to render the rights (as defined in the rights agreement) inapplicable to the transaction. the rights amendment provides, among other things, that none of the vpc parties (as defined in the rights amendment) shall be deemed to have become an acquiring person (as defined in the rights agreement) and no holder of rights shall be entitled to exercise such rights solely by reason of (i) the approval, execution, delivery or performance of the restated financing agreement, (ii) the public announcement of the transaction, (iii) the consummation of the transaction, (iv) the acquiring of beneficial ownership of common stock by any vpc party (a) in connection with the transaction, (b) upon the conversion commencement date (as defined in the convertible notes), (c) upon conversion of the convertible notes, (d) upon the stockholder approval or the filing (each as defined in the restated financing agreement) or (e) otherwise pursuant to the restated financing agreement, or (v) the vpc parties&#146; ownership of the securities (as defined in the restated financing agreement) or any
