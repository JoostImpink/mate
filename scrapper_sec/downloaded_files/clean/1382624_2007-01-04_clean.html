(k) the company shall keep copies of this agreement and any notices given or received hereunder available for inspection by the holders upon reasonable advance written notice and during normal business hours at its office. the company shall supply the holders from time to time with such numbers of copies of this agreement as the holders may reasonably request. section 4. tax matters (a) the company will pay all documentary stamp taxes attributable to the initial issuance of warrant shares upon the exercise of warrants; provided, that the company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue of any warrant certificates or any certificates for warrant shares in a name other than that of the holder of a warrant certificate surrendered upon the exercise of a warrant, and the company shall not be required to issue or deliver such warrant certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid. (b) the company will treat the warrants as common stock for united states federal and applicable state and local income and franchise tax purposes, except as otherwise required by law. section 5. reservation of warrant shares (a) the company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued common 9 stock, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue warrant shares upon exercise of warrants, the maximum number of shares of common stock which may then be deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding warrants. (b) the company or, if appointed, the transfer agent for the common stock (the "transfer agent") and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. the company will keep a copy of this agreement on file with the transfer agent and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the warrants. the company will supply such transfer agent with duly executed certificates for such purposes and will provide or otherwise make available any cash which may be payable as provided in section 7 hereof. the company will furnish such transfer agent a copy of all notices of adjustments, and certificates related thereto, transmitted to each holder pursuant to section 12 hereof. (c) the company covenants that all warrant shares which may be issued upon exercise of warrants will, upon issue, be fully paid, nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests with respect to the issuance thereof. (d) the company shall use its reasonable best efforts (including, if necessary, obtaining an amendment to the charter) to ensure that there remains a sufficient number of shares of common stock that are authorized under the charter and unissued to satisfy the company's obligations under this agreement. section 6. adjustment of number of warrant shares issuable each warrant will initially be exercisable by the holder thereof into one share of common stock. the number of warrant shares that may be purchased upon the exercise of each warrant will be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in this section 6. (a) adjustments for change in common stock. if at any time after the date of this agreement the company: (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its common stock; (ii) subdivides or reclassifies its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares; (iii) combines or reclassifies its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares; 10 (iv) issues by reclassification of its common stock any capital stock of the company (other than reclassifications arising solely as a result of a change in the par value or no par value of the common stock); or (v) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its capital stock other than common stock; then the number of warrant shares for which each warrant may be exercised immediately prior to such action shall be proportionately adjusted upon the occurrence of such event (and any other appropriate actions shall be taken by the company) so that the holder of any warrant thereafter exercised may receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the company that such holder would have owned immediately following such action if such warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such action. if upon exercise of a warrant after an adjustment to the number of warrant shares for which each warrant may be exercised pursuant to clauses (iv) or (v) of this section 6(a), the holder of such warrant may receive shares of two or more classes or series of equity of the company, the exercise rights and the number of shares of each class of capital stock for which each warrant may be exercised shall thereafter be subject to further adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to the common stock in this section 6. the adjustment pursuant to this section 6(a) shall be made successively each time that any event listed in this section 6(a) above shall occur. the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. (b) adjustments for issuances. in case the company shall issue common stock or convertible securities for a consideration per share of common stock (determined in the case of such convertible securities, by dividing (x) the total amount receivable by the company in consideration of the sale and issuance of such convertible securities, plus the total consideration payable to the company upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total number of shares of common stock covered by such convertible securities) less than either the (i) dilution price or (ii) current market price (determined as provided in section 6(e)), the number of warrant shares for which each warrant may be exercised shall be determined by multiplying the number of warrant shares issuable immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the company fixes the offering price of such additional shares by a fraction (not less than one) of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such issuance (and assuming that such convertible securities had been fully exercised or converted, as the case may be, but determined without giving effect to the adjustment in this section 6(b)) and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the date on which the company fixes the offering price of such common stock or convertible securities plus a number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by or payable to the company for the additional shares of common stock so issued or sold or to be issued, purchased or subscribed for upon exercise of such convertible securities by the greater of the dilution price or the current market price (determined as provided in section 6(e)) based on the date on 11 which the company fixes the offering price of such additional shares. the adjustment pursuant to this section 6(b) shall be made successively each time that any event listed in this section 6(b) above shall occur and shall be effective immediately after the issuance of such common stock or convertible securities. (c) superseding adjustment. if, at any time (x) after any adjustment in the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants shall have been made pursuant to section 6(b) on the basis of the issuance of convertible securities or (y) after new adjustments in the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants shall have been made pursuant to this section 6(c): (i) the right of conversion, exercise or exchange in such convertible securities shall expire, and the right of conversion, exercise or exchange in respect of any or all of such convertible securities shall not have been exercised; and/or (ii) the consideration per share for which, or the number of, shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the terms of such convertible securities shall be increased or decreased by virtue of provisions therein or by virtue of the conversion rate or exchange rate of such security being changed upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event or by agreement between the company and the holders of such securities; such previous adjustment shall be rescinded and annulled. thereupon, a recomputation shall be made of the effect of such rights, options or warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities on the basis of: (a) treating the number of shares of common stock, if any, theretofore actually issued or issuable pursuant to the previous exercise of such right of conversion, exercise or exchange as having been issued on the date or dates of such exercise and for the consideration actually received and receivable therefor, and treating the convertible securities that have expired and have not been exercised as if such securities had not been issued; and (b) with respect to securities as to which the consideration per share of common stock or the number of shares of common stock issuable has been changed, treating any such convertible securities that then remain outstanding as having been granted or issued immediately after the time of such increase or decrease for the consideration per share for which shares of common stock are issuable under such convertible securities; and in each such case, a new adjustment in the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants shall be made, which new adjustment shall supersede the previous adjustment so rescinded and annulled. no adjustment in the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants pursuant to this section 6(c) shall change the number of or otherwise affect any shares of common stock issued prior to such adjustment upon exercise of the warrants. 12 (d) adjustment for other distributions(i) . in case at any time or from time to time the company shall distribute to any holder of its common stock in respect of such shares any dividend or other distribution (collectively, a "distribution") of (x) cash; (y) any evidences of its indebtedness (other than convertible securities to the extent an adjustment is made as required by section 6(a)), any shares of its capital stock (other than shares of common stock or, to the extent an adjustment is made as required by section 6(a), convertible securities) or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever; or (z) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any evidences of its indebtedness (other than convertible securities to the extent an adjustment is made as required by section 6(a)), shares of its capital stock (other than shares of common stock or, to the extent an adjustment is made as required by section 6(a), convertible securities) or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever; then, and in each such case, in consideration of the lenders entering into the credit agreement, such holder shall be entitled to receive upon the making of such distribution and without further payment, the cash, evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock, other securities or property, options, warrants and/or other rights (or any portion thereof) to which such holder would have been entitled by way of such distribution as if such holder had fully exercised such holder's warrant(s) immediately prior to such distribution. (e) current market price. for the purpose of any computation under this section 6, the current market price (the "current market price") per share of common stock or any other security of the company (the "applicable share") on any date shall be deemed to be (i) if the security is registered under the exchange act and is being sold in a firm commitment underwritten public offering registered under the securities act, the public offering price of such security set forth on the cover page of the prospectus relating to such offering or (ii) if the security is otherwise registered under the exchange act, the average of the daily closing prices of such applicable share on the principal national securities exchange on which the applicable shares are listed or admitted to trading or, if the applicable shares are not so listed, the average daily closing bid prices of such applicable shares on the nasdaq stock market if the applicable shares are quoted thereon, or if not quoted on the nasdaq stock market, the average of the closing bid and asked prices in the over-the-counter market as furnished by the nasdaq stock market or any new york stock exchange member firm selected from time to time by the company for that purpose, in any such case, for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day before the date in question. if, on any date on which computation of the current market price is to be made hereunder, the applicable shares are not so listed or quoted on a national securities exchange, the nasdaq stock market or the over-the-counter market (or if the market price is not determinable for at least ten trading days in such period), the current market price shall be the fair value of the applicable shares. "dilution price" means, with respect to each share of common stock, $5.30, subject to appropriate adjustments for the events described in sections 6(a) and 6(h). 13 "fair value" means, at any date of determination, the value per applicable share, determined in good faith by the board of directors and certified in a board resolution, taking into account the most recently completed arms-length transaction between the company and a person other than an affiliate of the company; provided, however, that if the holders of at least 33% of the warrant shares issued or issuable upon exercise of the warrants request that the company obtain an opinion of a nationally recognized investment banking firm chosen by the company (who shall bear the expense) and reasonably acceptable to such requesting holders, then fair value shall be as determined by such investment banking firm. (f) no amendments. the company (i) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue common stock on the exercise of the warrants from time to time outstanding and (ii) will not take any action that results in any adjustment of the number of warrant shares if the total number of shares of common stock issuable after the action upon the exercise of all of the warrants would exceed the total number of shares of common stock then authorized by the charter and available for the purposes of issue upon such exercise. (g) no adjustment of warrant share number in certain cases. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any provision of this agreement, no adjustment of the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant shall be made: (i) upon the issuance or sale of the warrants; (ii) upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of any convertible security; or (iii) upon the issuance of up to 920, 902 shares (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations and other transactions substantially similar to those described in section 6(a) above, "plan shares") in the aggregate of restricted or other common stock for compensation or incentive purposes in accordance with the plans; or (iv) if the amount of said adjustment shall be less than 1% of the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that in such case any adjustments that would otherwise have been required to be made shall be carried forward and shall be made at the earlier of (i) time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment(s) so carried forward, amounts to at least 1% and (ii) upon (and immediately prior to) exercise of any of the warrants. (h) consolidation, merger, reorganization or recapitalization. (i) in case at any time the company shall be a party to any transaction (including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets, liquidation or recapitalization of the common stock, not subject to adjustment under any of sections 6(a) through (d)) in which the previously outstanding common stock shall be converted or changed into or exchanged 14 for different securities of the company or common stock or other securities of another corporation or interests in a non-corporate person or other property (including cash) or any combination of the foregoing (each such transaction being herein called an "adjustment transaction"), then the company shall use reasonable best efforts to have lawful and adequate provision made so that each holder of a warrant, upon the exercise thereof at any time on or after the consummation of the adjustment transaction, shall be entitled to receive, and such warrant shall thereafter represent the right to receive, in lieu of the warrant shares issuable upon such exercise prior to such consummation, the securities, cash or other property to which such holder would have been entitled upon consummation of the adjustment transaction if such holder had exercised such warrant into warrant shares immediately prior thereto (subject to adjustments from and after the consummation date as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this section 6). to the extent such warrant remains outstanding after such adjustment transaction, the foregoing provisions of this section 6(h) shall similarly apply to successive mergers, consolidations, sales of assets, liquidations and recapitalizations. (ii) in case at any time the company shall be a party to any transaction (by way of merger or otherwise) which contemplates a sale of all of the capital stock of the company, the company shall, if requested by any holder, use its reasonable efforts to cause such transaction to be structured in a manner that requires the purchaser(s) to purchase the warrants from such holder at a price equal to the consideration such holder would have received had it exercised the warrants immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction less the exercise price of such warrants. (i) consideration received. for purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to this section 6, the following shall apply: (i) in the case of the issuance of shares of common stock for cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash; provided, that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts or other expenses incurred by the company for any underwriting of the issue or otherwise in connection therewith; (ii) in the case of the issuance of shares of common stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the value thereof as determined in good faith by the board of directors and certified in a board resolution; and (iii) in the case of the issuance of convertible securities, the aggregate consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the company for the issuance of such securities plus the additional minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof (the consideration in each case to be determined in the same manner as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of this section 6(i)). (j) form of warrants. irrespective of any adjustments in the number of warrant shares for which each warrant may be exercised or kind of shares or 15 other assets purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants, warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares or other assets as are stated in the warrants initially issuable pursuant to this agreement. (k) no dilution or impairment. if, at any time or from time to time after the issuance of the warrants but prior to the exercise or conversion thereof, (i) the company shall take any action which (a) affects the common stock and (b) is similar to, or has an effect similar to, any of the actions described in any of sections 6(a), (b), (c) or (d) (but not including any action described in any such section) and (ii) the board of directors in good faith determines that it would be equitable under such circumstances to adjust the number of warrant shares for which each warrant may be exercised as a result of such action, then, and in each such case, such number of warrant shares shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as the board of directors in good faith determines would be equitable under such circumstances, which determination shall be certified in a board resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed by the company to the holders. section 7. fractional interests the company shall not issue fractional warrant shares on the exercise of warrants. if more than one warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same holder, the number of full warrant shares which shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of warrant shares purchasable on exercise of the warrants so presented. if any fraction of a warrant share would, except for the provisions of this section 7, be issuable on the exercise of any warrants (or specified portion thereof), the company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the fair value per warrant share, as determined on the day immediately preceding the date the warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied by such fraction, computed to the nearest whole united states cent. section 8. representations and warranties of the company the company hereby represents and warrants to the purchasers as of the date of this agreement as follows: (a) power and authority. the company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this agreement, the warrant certificates and the registration rights agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit d (the "registration rights agreement" and together with the voting agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit e, the "voting agreement", the related agreements), to issue and sell the warrants and the warrant shares, and to carry out the provisions of this agreement, the warrant certificates and the related agreements. 16 (b) capitalization.

(b) registration of other securities. whenever the company shall effect a registration pursuant to this section 2.1, no securities other than registrable securities shall be included among the securities covered by such registration unless the selling holders of not less than 51% of all registrable securities to be covered by such registration shall have consented in writing to the inclusion of such other securities. 3 (c) registration statement form. registrations under this section 2.1 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the commission as shall be reasonably selected by the company.

(e) selection of underwriters. the underwriter or underwriters of each underwritten offering of the registrable securities so to be registered shall be selected by the selling holders of not less than 51% of the registrable securities to be covered by such registration and shall be reasonably acceptable to the company. (f) priority in requested registration. if the managing underwriter of any underwritten offering shall advise the company in writing (and the company shall so advise each selling holder of registrable securities requesting registration) that, in its opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to the selling holders of 662/3% of the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration, the company, except as provided in the following sentence, will include in such registration, to the extent of the number and type that the company is so advised can be sold in such offering, registrable securities requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among the selling holders requesting such registration on the basis of the estimated gross proceeds from the sale thereof. if the total number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration cannot be included as provided in the preceding sentence, holders of registrable securities requesting registration thereof pursuant to section 2.1, representing not less than 331/3% of the registrable securities with respect to which registration has been requested and constituting not less than 662/3% of the initiating holders, shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice to the company within 20 days after receipt of such notice by the company and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted for purposes of the requests for registration to which holders of registrable securities are entitled pursuant to section 2.1 hereof. in connection with any such registration to which this section 2.1(f) is applicable, no securities other than registrable securities shall be covered by such registration. 4 (g) limitations on registration on request. notwithstanding anything in this section 2.1 to the contrary, in no event will the company be required to (i) effect, in the aggregate, more than three registrations pursuant to this section 2.1, (ii) effect more than one registration pursuant to this section 2.1 within the 12-month period occurring immediately subsequent to the effectiveness (within the meaning of section 2.1(d)) of a registration statement filed pursuant to this section 2.1 or (iii) effect, any registrations required by section 2.1 for registrable securities having an aggregate offering price of less than $5 (five) million dollars.
