stockholders: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; jmsk ltd &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; by: &#160; &#160; &#160; name: steven gold &#160; &#160; title: general partner &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; annex a plan of distribution the selling stockholders and any of their pledgees, donees, transferees, assignees or other successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of their shares of common stock or interests in shares of common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions.&#160; these dispositions may be at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market price, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices.&#160; the selling stockholders may use one or more of the following methods when disposing of the shares or interests therein: &#8226; ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; &#8226; block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; &#8226; through brokers, dealers or underwriters that may act solely as agents; &#8226; purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; &#8226; an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; &#8226; privately negotiated transactions; &#8226; through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; &#8226; broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; &#8226; a combination of any such methods of disposition; and &#8226; any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. the selling stockholders may also sell shares under rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or securities act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales.&#160; broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated.&#160; the selling stockholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. the selling stockholders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of common stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell shares of common stock from time to time under this prospectus, or under a supplement or amendment to this prospectus under rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the securities act amending the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. upon being notified in writing by a selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of common stock through a block trade, special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, we will file a supplement to this prospectus, if required, pursuant to rule 424(b) under the securities act, disclosing (i) the name of each such selling stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), (ii) the number of shares involved, (iii) the price at which such shares of common stock were sold, (iv) the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable, (v) that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and (vi) other facts material to the transaction.&#160; in addition, upon being notified in writing by a selling stockholder that a donee or pledge intends to sell more than 500 shares of common stock, we will file a supplement to this prospectus if then required in accordance with applicable securities law. the selling stockholders also may transfer the shares of common stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. in connection with the sale of the shares of common stock or interests in shares of common stock, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume.&#160; the selling stockholders may also sell shares of common stock short after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities.&#160; the selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). the selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the securities act in connection with such sales.&#160; in such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the securities act.&#160; the maximum commission or discount to be received by any member of the financial industry regulatory authority (finra) or independent broker-dealer will not be greater than 8% of the initial gross proceeds from the sale of any security being sold. we have advised the selling stockholders that they are required to comply with regulation m promulgated under the securities and exchange act during such time as they may be engaged in a distribution of the shares.&#160; the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock. the aggregate proceeds to the selling security holders from the sale of the common stock offered by them will be the purchase price of the common stock less discounts or commissions, if any.&#160;
