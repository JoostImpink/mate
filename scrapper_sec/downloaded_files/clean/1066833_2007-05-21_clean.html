on january 24, 2007, the reporting persons and certain other beneficial owners who, in aggregate, held approximately 88% of the aggregate principal amount of debentures entered into a consensual restructuring agreement (the &#147;restructuring support agreement&#148;) and related agreements with dov.&#160; under the restructuring support agreement, dov&#146;s obligations with respect to the debentures were restructured and holders of approximately 88% of the debentures, including the reporting persons, agreed to, among other things, (i) tender their debentures in the exchange offer (as defined below) and (ii) not take any actions in connection with any default or event of default under the indenture, unless dov commenced or a party commenced against it any bankruptcy or similar proceeding or the restructuring support agreement was terminated for any other reason. pursuant to an exchange offer commenced by dov on january 29, 2007 (the &#147;exchange offer&#148;), the reporting persons exchanged the debentures beneficially owned by them for $4.34 million in cash, 64,000 shares of a new series c convertible preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share and liquidation preference of $100 per share (&#147;series c preferred stock&#148;) and 100,000 shares of a new series d convertible preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share and no initial stated liquidation preference (&#147;series d preferred stock&#148;).&#160; the certificates of designation for the series c preferred stock and series d preferred stock condition the right to convert into shares of common stock upon the filing of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation.&#160; in addition, the terms of the series d preferred stock provide that the company shall not effect the conversion and the reporting persons shall not have the right to convert any shares of series d preferred stock into shares of common stock to the extent that the reporting persons would beneficially own shares of capital stock having in excess of 9.99% of the voting power of dov immediately after giving effect to such conversion (the &#147;blocker&#148;). the series c preferred stock is convertible into 12,225,672 shares of dov common stock.&#160;
