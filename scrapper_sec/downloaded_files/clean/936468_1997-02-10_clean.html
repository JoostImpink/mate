(the "company"), a delaware corporation. the principal executive offices of the company are located at 2440 research boulevard, suite 400, rockville, maryland 20850. item 2. identity and background this statement on schedule 13d is being filed jointly on behalf of the following persons (collectively, the "reporting persons") (1) lockheed martin corporation, a maryland corporation ("lmc"), and (2) lockheed martin commercial launch services, inc., a delaware corporation ("lmcls"). lmcls is a commercial launch services provider and provided launch services to orion atlantic as the launch subcontractor. the address of the principal business and principal office of lmcls is 12999 deer creek canyon road, littleton, colorado 80127. lmc owns all of the capital stock of lmcls and its principal business is aerospace/defense. the address of the principal business and principal office of lmc is 6801 rockledge drive, bethesda, maryland 20817. the name, business address, citizenship, present and principal occupation or employment, and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or organization in which each such employment is conducted, of each executive officer or member of the board of directors, as applicable, of lmcls and lmc are set forth on schedules a and b, respectively, attached hereto. during the past five (5) years, neither any of the reporting persons nor, to the best knowledge of any of the reporting persons, any of the other persons listed on schedules a and b attached hereto, has been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, united states federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. although lmc has not been convicted in a criminal proceeding, and has not been subject to a judgment, decree or final order, in each case of the type described in the immediately preceding paragraph, lockheed corporation (one of the predecessor corporations to lmc) entered into a plea agreement page 4 of 16 pages dated january 27, 1995 with the united states of america with respect to certain violations. for further information concerning the plea agreement and the events out of which it arose, see the description contained in the joint proxy statement/ prospectus, page 54, under the caption "lockheed plea agreement," which is contained in registration statement no. 33- 57645 on form s-4 filed by lmc on february 9, 1995. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration a predecessor to the business of lmcls acquired 239,769 shares of common stock from orion network systems, inc., now named orion oldco services, inc. ("orion oldco"), in a private placement on september 11, 1989 for an aggregate purchase price of $2,347,826.40. such number of shares is after giving effect to two reverse stock splits effected after the date of issuance. such shares of common stock were ultimately acquired by lmcls through the acquisition of such business. pursuant to a merger transaction (the "merger") which occurred on january 31, 1997, orion oldco became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. as a result of the merger, lmcls beneficially owns 239,769 shares of common stock of the company which it received in exchange for the 239,769 shares of common stock of orion oldco previously held by it. on december 16, 1996, orion oldco announced that it had agreed to acquire all of the interests which it did not already own in the orion atlantic partnership. the agreement to acquire such interests was pursuant to a section 351 exchange agreement and plan of conversion dated june 1996, as amended pursuant to a first amendment thereto dated december 1996 (as so amended, the "exchange agreement"). pursuant to the exchange agreement, orion oldco, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company as described above, agreed, among other things, to have the company issue shares of series c 6% cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock (the "series c preferred stock") in exchange for the limited partnership interests in orion atlantic held by all limited partners other than orion oldco or its subsidiaries (the "exchanging partners") and other rights relating thereto (the "exchange"). as a result of the exchange, which was consummated on january 31, 1997, the company became the direct or indirect owner of all of the partnership interests in orion atlantic. in addition, the company acquired certain rights currently held by the exchanging partners, including the exchanging partners' rights to receive repayment of various advances made to orion atlantic. pursuant to the exchange, lmcls received 19,750 shares of series c preferred stock. subject to the preferential rights of certain other shares of capital stock of the company, the series c preferred stock is entitled page 5 of 16 pages to receive dividents that accrue daily at the per annum rate of 6% of the liquidation value ($1,000 per share). such dividends are payable exclusively (except in the event of liquidation) in the company's common stock. the number of shares of common stock distributable as a dividend on each share of series c preferred stock is calculated based on the market price of such common stock under a formula set forth in the certificate of designations for the series c preferred stock (the "certificate of designations"). at any time and from time to time after the issuance thereof, any holders of series c preferred stock may convert any or all of the shares of series c preferred stock (including any fraction thereof) held by such holder into a number of shares of common stock equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock computed by multiplying the number of shares of series c preferred stock to be converted by $1,000 and dividing the result by $17.50, subject to adjustment, plus (b) the number of shares of common stock that would be payable if all accrued but unpaid dividends were declared and paid on the shares of series c preferred stock to be converted. accordingly, without giving effect to any shares of common stock issuable in respect of accrued but unpaid dividends, 1,128,571 shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of the series c preferred stock held by lmcls. the closing of the exchange agreement was conditioned upon, among other conditions, the satisfaction or waiver by lmcls of the condition that lmcls and matra marconi space uk limited enter into a subcontract to the orion ii satellite contract relating to the launch of orion ii. in addition, the obligations of the exchanging partners under various financing and other agreements relating to the orion atlantic partnership were terminated upon the consummation of the exchange. the information set forth in exhibits 2, 3 and 4 hereto is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference and the response to item 3 of this statement on schedule 13d is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of such exhibit. item 4. purpose of transaction as described in item 3 above, lmcls (i) acquired the common stock of orion oldco previously held by it pursuant to its acquisition of the business by its predecessor, (ii) acquired the shares of common stock of the company in exchange for such shares of orion oldco pursuant to the merger and (iii) acquired the shares of series c preferred stock held by it pursuant to the exchange agreement. lmcls continues to hold the common stock and the series c preferred stock held by it for investment purposes. none of the reporting persons has any intention of acquiring control over the company; however, depending upon market and other conditions, lmcls or its affiliates may acquire additional shares of common stock for investment purposes if such shares of page 6 of 16 pages common stock become available at prices that are attractive to them, or may, subject to any restrictions contained in the resales restrictions agreement (as defined below) or under applicable securities laws, dispose of all or a portion of the common stock that they currently own or may hereinafter acquire. except as disclosed in this schedule 13d, the reporting persons do not have any plans or proposals of the type set forth in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer lmcls may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the 1,368,340 shares of common stock (the "lmcls shares") directly owned by it or issuable upon conversion of the series c preferred stock directly owned by it, or 11.14% of the common stock outstanding. lmcls has the sole power to vote and the sole power to dispose of the lmcls shares. lmc, as the sole stockholder of lmcls, may be deemed for the purposes of rule 13d-3 under the act, to beneficially own indirectly the lmcls shares. the percentage of the common stock outstanding reported as beneficially owned by each reporting person herein on the date hereof is based upon the 11,554,626 shares of common stock actually outstanding as of the close of business on january 31, 1997 (after giving effect to the merger and the exchange) plus the 1,128,571 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series c preferred stock held by lmcls (but without giving effect to any shares issuable in respect of accrued but unpaid dividends on the series c preferred stock and without giving effect to the issuance of any shares of common stock upon exercise of options or warrants or upon conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities held by any other person). item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer the response to item 3 of this statement on schedule 13d is incorporated herein by reference. the holders of series c preferred stock are entitled to vote on all matters submitted to the company's stockholders for a vote together with the holders of the company's common stock, series a 8% cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock and series b 8% cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock, voting together as a single class. the holder of a share of series c preferred stock (including fractional shares) will be entitled to 1 vote for each whole share of the company's common stock issuable upon conversion of such share of series c preferred stock. see the certificate of designations page 7 of 16 pages attached hereto as exhibit 4 for the powers, rights and preferences of, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of, the series c preferred stock. pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into pursuant to the exchange agreement, the exchanging partners (including lmcls) were granted certain shelf, demand and "piggyback" registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock or other securities issued or issuable upon conversion of the series c preferred stock or issued as dividends or distributions pursuant to the certificate of designations. see the registration rights agreement attached as exhibit d to the exchange agreement. pursuant to a resales restriction agreement entered into on january 31, 1997 (the "resales restriction agreement"), each of the exchanging partners agreed, among other things, that it will not transfer any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of shares of series c preferred stock or as dividends on series c preferred stock (the "affected shares") for 180 days after the issuance of the series c preferred stock without the prior written consent of the company, unless such a transfer is to an affiliate or does not involve a public distribution or public offering or occurs as the result of certain events set forth in the resales restriction agreement, and is conducted as provided in the resales restriction agreement. also, each of the exchanging partners agreed, pursuant to the resales restriction agreement, until january 31, 2002 not to transfer during any 90- day period affected shares that collectively represent more than 25% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series c preferred stock received by such exchanging partner pursuant to the exchange agreement or as dividends on the series c preferred stock, except as provided in the resales restriction agreement. see the resales restriction agreement attached as exhibit e to the exchange agreement. the
