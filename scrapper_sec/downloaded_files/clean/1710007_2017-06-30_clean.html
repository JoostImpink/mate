into an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of june 21, 2017 (the &#8220;merger agreement&#8221;), with enernoc. pursuant to the merger agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

(the &#8220;offer price&#8221;) in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes. the offer is subject to customary conditions. the merger agreement further provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, following successful completion of the offer, purchaser will merge with and into enernoc, with enernoc continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of egpna (the &#8220;merger&#8221;). the merger will be governed by section 251(h) of the general corporation law of the state of delaware, with no shareholder vote being required to consummate the merger. in the merger, each outstanding share of enernoc (other than shares held by egpna, purchaser, enernoc, or shareholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under delaware law) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the offer price, subject to any required withholding of taxes and without interest. each outstanding stock option to purchase enernoc shares will be cancelled and each former holder of any such cancelled option will be entitled to receive a payment in cash of an amount equal to the excess of the offer price over the exercise price of the enernoc stock option. any enernoc stock option with an exercise price per share in excess of the offer price will be canceled without payment therefor. concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, egpna and purchaser entered into tender and support agreements (the &#8220;support agreements&#8221;) with the supporting shareholders, pursuant to which the supporting shareholders have agreed, solely in their capacities as shareholders of enernoc, to tender into the offer enernoc shares now held or hereafter acquired by the supporting shareholders and otherwise support the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including by voting such shares for matters necessary to consummate the transactions and against matters that could materially delay or interfere with the transactions. as of june 20, 2017, the supporting shareholders beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 2,830,569 shares of enernoc. the support agreements only apply to 2,830,569 shares of all outstanding shares as of june 20, 2017 (or approximately 9.02% of all outstanding shares as of june 20, 2017). the support agreements will terminate upon certain events, including any termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. in such case, any shares tendered by the supporting shareholders would be returned. in addition, upon a change of recommendation by the board of directors of enernoc certain of the supporting shareholders&#8217; obligations and rights under the support agreements will not apply. after the consummation of the offer, purchaser intends to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable.&#160; at the effective time of the merger, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form of purchaser&#8217;s certificate of incorporation (except with respect to name and certain indemnification and exculpation provisions), (ii) the by-laws of the surviving corporation will be amended and restated to be in the form of purchaser&#8217;s by-laws (except with respect to name and certain indemnification provisions), and (iii) except as otherwise determined by egpna (a) the directors of purchaser immediately after to the effective time of the merger will be the initial directors of the surviving corporation and (b) the officers of enernoc immediately after the effective time of the merger will be the initial officers of the surviving corporation. the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement and the support agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full terms of the merger agreement and the support agreements, which are filed as exhibits 1 and 2 and are incorporated herein by reference. following the merger, enernoc shares will no longer be traded on nasdaq, there will be no public market for the enernoc shares and registration of enernoc shares under the exchange act will be terminated. the purpose of the support agreements is to facilitate the acquisition of enernoc shares in the offer and the consummation of the merger. the purpose of the

114 of this title. such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. any stockholder entitled to &#160; -2- appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to &#167; 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by &#167; 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder&#8217;s shares. such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder&#8217;s shares. if such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i)&#160;each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii)&#160;the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to &#167; 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by &#167; 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder&#8217;s shares in accordance with this subsection. an affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. for purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. if no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given. (e) within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a)&#160;and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the court of chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder&#8217;s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a)&#160;and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder&#8217;s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d)&#160;of this section hereof, whichever is later. notwithstanding subsection (a)&#160;of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person&#8217;s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection. (f) upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the register in chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and &#160; -3- addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. if the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. the register in chancery, if so ordered by the court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the city of wilmington, delaware or such publication as the court deems advisable. the forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation. (g) at the hearing on such petition, the court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. the court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the register in chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. if immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1)&#160;the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2)&#160;the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1&#160;million, or (3)&#160;the merger was approved pursuant to &#167; 253 or &#167; 267 of this title. (h) after the court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the court of chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. through such proceeding the court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. in determining such fair value, the court shall take into account all relevant factors. unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the federal reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1)&#160;the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, and (2)&#160;interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f)&#160;of this section and who has submitted such stockholder&#8217;s certificates of stock to the register in chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section. (i) the court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. payment shall be so made to &#160; -4- each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. the court&#8217;s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the court of chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this state or of any state. (j) the costs of the proceeding may be determined by the court and taxed upon the parties as the court deems equitable in the circumstances. upon application of a stockholder, the court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. (k) from and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d)&#160;of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e)&#160;of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder&#8217;s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e)&#160;of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the court of chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder&#8217;s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e)&#160;of this section. (l) the shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation. &#160; -5- ex-3 4 s001766x1_ex3.htm exhibit 3 exhibit 3 joint filing agreement in accordance with rule 13d-1(k)(1) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, the persons named below agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on schedule 13d (including amendments thereto) with respect to the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of enernoc, inc., a delaware corporation, and further agree that this joint filing agreement be included as an exhibit to such joint filings. in evidence thereof, the undersigned, being duly authorized, have executed this joint filing agreement this 28 th day of june, 2017. this joint filing agreement may be executed in counterparts and each of such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. &#160; dated: june 30, 2017 &#160; enel green power north america, inc. &#160; by: /s/ rafael gonzalez &#160; name: rafael gonzalez &#160; title: president and ceo &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; pine merger sub, inc. &#160; by: /s/ mike storch &#160; name: mike storch &#160; title: executive vice president &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; enel green power s. p .a &#160; by: /s/ antonio cammisecra &#160; name: antonio cammisecra &#160; title: ceo &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; enel s. p .a &#160; by: /s/ francesco starace &#160; name: francesco starace &#160; title: ceo and general manager
