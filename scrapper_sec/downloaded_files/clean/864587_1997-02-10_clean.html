(a) following receipt from the company of any notice of redemption pursuant to section 11.2 or section 11.3 or any notice of mandatory sale pursuant to section 11.4 (each, a "company notice"), each holder of debentures shall have ten (10) business days after receipt of the company notice (the "decision period") in which to notify the company in accordance with the provisions of section 23 that such holder wishes to convert all or a part of such holder's debentures (the "converted debenture portion") into shares of common stock in accordance with the provisions of section 15.2. if such notice is given in a timely manner by such holder (a "holder notice"), the proposed redemption of debentures by the company or proposed mandatory sale of underlying shares arranged by the company pursuant to section 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4 shall not impair the right of such holder to convert the converted debenture portion into shares of common stock pursuant to section 15.2. except as provided in the preceding sentence, no amount of debentures of any holder specified in the company notice as subject to redemption pursuant to section 11.2 or section 11.3 or mandatory sale pursuant to section 11.4 may be converted into shares of common stock pursuant to section 15.2 during the period commencing on the date of the company notice and ending on the earliest of (x) the date of any withdrawal of the company notice pursuant to section 11.5(b), (y) subject to section 11.5(c), the sixty-first (61st) day following the earlier of (i) the expiration of the decision period or (ii) the date of the company's receipt of the holder notice of such holder (the "company notice expiration date") or (z) the applicable redemption, repurchase or mandatory sale date. each holder giving a holder notice shall convert the converted debenture portion specified in the holder notice within fifteen (15) business days after the applicable redemption, repurchase, or mandatory sale date. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the company shall have given notice of redemption in compliance with section 11.2(a) and section 11.3(b) and notice of a mandatory sale in compliance with section 11.4(a) if the redemption date, the repurchase date or the mandatory sale date, as -25- the case may be, occurs not later than the day immediately preceding the company notice expiration date. (b) the company shall have the right to withdraw any company notice by notifying the holders of the debentures of such withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of section 23, but only if the notice of withdrawal is accompanied by a copy of a written notice, to the effect set forth in the following sentence from the underwriter, placement agent or proposed private placement purchaser from whom the company intended to raise the capital necessary to complete the proposed redemption or with whom the company intended to place the underlying shares in a proposed mandatory sale. such notice shall state that the amount of company securities included in the proposed offering (which, in the case of a mandatory sale, shall be the underlying shares included in such offering) would not be able to be sold at a price sufficient to yield proceeds at least equal to the redemption price specified in section 11.2 or section 11.3, as applicable, or the mandatory sale price. if any company notice is properly withdrawn pursuant to this section 11.5(b), failure by the company to make any redemption payment pursuant to section 11.2 or section 11.3 or to arrange for or make any payment in connection with a mandatory sale pursuant to section 11.4, in any case as proposed in such withdrawn company notice, (i) shall not constitute an event of default under this agreement and (ii) shall not constitute the one-time exercise by the company of its rights under section 11.4(b). (c) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, following receipt of a company notice, if the hsr act would require any filings to be made with respect to the conversion of any debenture subject to a company notice, each holder of debentures subject to the filing requirements of the hsr act upon any conversion of a debenture subject to a company notice shall have ten (10) business days after the expiration or early termination of any applicable hsr act waiting period to exercise the conversion privilege in accordance with section 15.2 with respect to such debentures before any proposed redemption of such debentures by the company or proposed mandatory sale of underlying shares arranged by the company pursuant to section 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4 shall impair the right of such holder to convert such debentures, and the company's right to redeem the debentures of any such holder or to require the mandatory sale of any underlying shares of any such holder shall be suspended until ten (10) business days after the expiration or early termination of the applicable hsr act waiting period (an "hsr suspension period"). if any hsr act filing shall be required hereunder, the company notice expiration date shall be the sixty-first (61st) day after the latest hsr suspension period applicable to any holder. 12. business covenants. from the closing date, and thereafter so long as any of the debentures are outstanding, the company will perform or comply with, as required, each of the following covenants: 12.1. payment of debentures and maintenance of office. the company will punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal, premium, if any, and interest to become due in respect of the debentures according to the terms thereof and hereof and will maintain an -26- office within the continental boundaries of the united states of america where notices, presentations and demands in respect of this agreement and the debentures may be made upon it and will notify each holder of a debenture of any change of location of such office. such office shall first be maintained at 2440 research boulevard, suite 400, rockville, maryland 20850. 12.2. payment of taxes and claims. the company will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, pay and discharge promptly (a) all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon it or any of its properties or assets or in respect of any of its franchises, business, income or profits before the same shall become delinquent and (b) all lawful claims of materialmen, mechanics, carriers, warehousemen, landlords and other similar persons for labor, materials, supplies and rentals which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien or charge upon its property, except to the extent that the failure so to pay any amount pursuant to (a) or (b) would not have a material adverse effect; provided, however, that none of the foregoing need be paid while being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings initiated within the period allowed by applicable law, rule or regulation and diligently conducted so long as (i) adequate book reserves have been established in accordance with gaap with respect thereto and (ii) neither the company's nor any such subsidiary's title to or right to the use of its properties is materially adversely affected thereby. 12.3. maintenance of properties and corporate existence. the company and its subsidiaries will each: (a) maintain its property in good condition and make all needful and proper renewals, replacements, additions, betterments and improvements thereto, all as in the judgment of the company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be conducted properly and advantageously at all times;

subordinated to such other indebtedness; provided that the limitation in this clause (ii) shall not apply to distinctions between categories of senior indebtedness which exist by reason of (a) any

concurrent offering of, shares of the capital stock of the company (other than disqualified stock); (v) payments or distributions, to dissenting stockholders pursuant to applicable law, pursuant to or in connection with a consolidation, merger or transfer of assets that complies with the provisions of this agreement applicable to mergers, consolidations and transfers of all or substantially all of the -36- property and assets of the company; (vi) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of (a) shares of series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock which were outstanding on the closing date and (b) shares of preferred stock pursuant to options that were outstanding on the closing date, in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of, an issuance of indebtedness incurred under clause (iii) of the second paragraph of part (a) of section 13.5; (vii) investments, to the extent the amount invested consists solely of net cash proceeds received by the company or any guarantor within six months of the making of such investment, from the issuance and sale permitted by this agreement of its capital stock (other than disqualified stock) to a person who is not a subsidiary of the company or any guarantor; (viii) investments, the sum of which does not exceed $5 million at any one time outstanding; (ix) cash payments, not to exceed $3 million, in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of capital stock of the company upon the exercise of any warrants to buy, or upon the conversion of any securities convertible into, capital stock of the company or (x) the purchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition for value of the warrants issued to the holders of the senior notes in connection with their acquisition of the senior notes pursuant to a repurchase offer provided for in the warrant agreement, dated as of january 31, 1997, between the company and bankers trust company as warrant agent; provided that, except in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), no potential event of default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing or occur as a consequence of the actions or payments set forth therein. each restricted payment permitted pursuant to the preceding paragraph (other than the restricted payment referred to in clause (ii) thereof and an exchange of capital stock for capital stock or indebtedness referred to in clause (iii) or (iv) thereof) and the net cash proceeds from any issuance of capital stock referred to in clauses (iii) and (iv) shall be included in calculating whether the conditions of clause (c) of the first paragraph of this section 13.6 have been met with respect to any subsequent restricted payments. in the event the proceeds of an issuance of capital stock of the company are used for the redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of the debentures, or indebtedness that is pari passu with the debentures, then the net cash proceeds of such issuance shall be included in clause (c) of the first paragraph of this section 13.6 only to the extent such proceeds are not, within six months, used for such redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of indebtedness. any restricted payments made other than in cash shall be valued at fair market value. the amount of any investment "outstanding" at any time shall be deemed to be equal to the amount of such investment on the date made, less the return of capital to the company and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to such investment (up to the amount of such investment on the date made). 13.7. limitation on the issuance and sale of capital stock of restricted subsidiaries. the company will not sell, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to issue or sell, any shares of capital stock of a restricted subsidiary (including options, warrants or other rights to purchase shares of such capital stock) except (i) to the company or a wholly owned restricted subsidiary; (ii) issuances of director's qualifying shares or sales to foreign nationals of shares of capital stock of foreign restricted subsidiaries, to the -37- extent required by applicable law; (iii) if, immediately after giving effect to such issuance or sale, such restricted subsidiary would no longer constitute a restricted subsidiary, provided any investment in such person remaining after giving effect to such issuance or sale would have been permitted to be made under section 13.6, if made on the date of such issuance or sale; and (iv) issuances or sales of common stock of any restricted subsidiary, the net cash proceeds of which are promptly applied pursuant to clause (i)(a) or (i)(b) of the second paragraph of section 13.11 of this agreement; provided that at no time may a restricted subsidiary, the common stock of which has been issued or sold pursuant to this clause (iv), be the owner of a satellite. 13.8. issuances of guarantees by new restricted subsidiaries. on the date that any person becomes a restricted subsidiary the company will cause such additional restricted subsidiary to execute a supplemental subsidiary guarantee, providing for a full and unconditional guarantee by such additional restricted subsidiary of the company's obligations under the debentures and this agreement to the same extent as that set forth in the subsidiary guarantee; provided that, in the case of any new restricted subsidiary that becomes a restricted subsidiary through the acquisition of a majority of its voting capital stock by the company or any other restricted subsidiary, such supplemental subsidiary guarantee may be subordinated to the extent required by the obligations of such new restricted subsidiary existing on the date of such acquisition that were not incurred in contemplation of such acquisition. 13.9. limitation on liens. the company will not, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien of any kind securing indebtedness that is pari passu with, or subordinated in right of payment to, the debentures on any of its assets or properties of any character, or any shares of capital stock or indebtedness of any restricted subsidiary, without making effective provision for all of the debentures and all other amounts due under this agreement to be directly secured equally and ratably with (or, if the obligation or liability to be secured by such lien is subordinated in right of payment to the debentures, prior to) the obligation or liability secured by such lien. the foregoing limitation does not apply to (i) liens existing on the closing date; (ii) liens granted after the closing date on any assets or capital stock of the company or its restricted subsidiaries created in favor of the holders of debentures; (iii) liens with respect to the assets of a restricted subsidiary granted by such restricted subsidiary to the company or a wholly owned restricted subsidiary to secure indebtedness owing to the company or such other restricted subsidiary; (iv) liens securing indebtedness which is incurred to refinance secured indebtedness which is permitted to be incurred under clause (iii) of the second paragraph of section 13.5; provided that such liens do not extend to or cover any property or assets of the company or any restricted subsidiary other than the property or assets securing the indebtedness being refinanced; or (v) permitted liens. the company will not, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien on orion 1, orion 2 or orion 3 that secures indebtedness other than pursuant to clause (xxi) of the definition of permitted lien. -38- 13.10. limitation on sale-leaseback transactions. the company will not, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into any sale-leaseback transaction involving any of its assets or properties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, whereby the company or a restricted subsidiary sells or transfers such assets or properties and then or thereafter leases such assets or properties or any part thereof or any other assets or properties which the company or such restricted subsidiary, as the case may be, intends to use for substantially the same purpose or purposes as the assets or properties sold or transferred. the foregoing restriction does not apply to any sale-leaseback transaction if (i) the lease is for a period, including renewal rights, of not in excess of three (3) years; (ii) the lease secures or relates to industrial revenue or pollution control bonds; (iii) the transaction is solely between the company and any wholly owned restricted subsidiary or solely between wholly owned restricted subsidiaries; or (iv) the company or such restricted subsidiary, within twelve (12) months after the sale or transfer of any assets or properties is completed, applies an amount not less than the net proceeds received from such sale or transfer in accordance with clause (i) (a) or (i) (b) of the second paragraph of section 13.11. 13.11. limitation on asset sales. the company will not, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary to, consummate any asset sale unless (i) the consideration received by the company or such restricted subsidiary (including the amount of any released indebtedness) is at least equal to the fair market value of the assets sold or disposed of and (ii) at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the consideration received (excluding the amount of any released indebtedness) consists of cash or temporary cash investments. in the event and to the extent that the net cash proceeds received by the company or any of its restricted subsidiaries from one or more asset sales occurring on or after the senior notes reduction date in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months exceed ten percent (10%) of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets (determined as of the date closest to the commencement of such twelve (12) month period for which a consolidated balance sheet of the company and its subsidiaries has been filed with the commission), then the company shall or shall cause the relevant restricted subsidiary to (i) within twelve months after the date net cash proceeds so received exceed ten percent (10%) of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets (a) apply an amount equal to such excess net cash proceeds to permanently repay senior indebtedness of the company or of any restricted subsidiary owing to a person other than the company or any of its restricted subsidiaries or (b) invest an equal amount, or the amount not so applied pursuant to clause (a) (or enter into a definitive agreement committing to so invest within twelve (12) months after the date of such agreement), in property or assets (other than current assets) of a nature or type or that are used in a business (or in a company having property and assets of a nature or type, or engaged in a business) similar or related to the nature or type of the property and assets of, or the business of, the company and its restricted subsidiaries existing on the date of such investment. 13.12. insurance. the company shall maintain (a) in-orbit insurance with respect to orion 1 in an amount at least equal to the cost to replace such satellite with a satellite -39- of comparable or superior technological capability (as estimated by the board of directors) and having at least as much transmission capacity as such satellite was designed to have, and (b) with respect to orion 2, orion 3, each other satellite to be launched by the company or any restricted subsidiary and each replacement satellite therefor, (i) launch insurance with respect to each such satellite covering the period from the launch of such satellite to one hundred eighty (180) days following such launch in an amount equal to or greater than the sum of (a) the cost to replace such satellite pursuant to the contract pursuant to which a replacement satellite will be constructed, (b) the cost to launch a replacement satellite pursuant to the contract pursuant to which a replacement satellite will be launched and (c) the cost of launch insurance for such satellite or, in the event that the company has reason to believe that the cost of obtaining comparable insurance for a replacement satellite would be materially higher, the company's best estimate of the cost of such comparable insurance and (ii) at all times subsequent to one hundred eighty (180) days after the launch (if it is a successful launch) of each such satellite, in-orbit insurance in an amount at least equal to the cost to replace such satellite with a satellite of comparable or superior technological capability (as estimated by the board of directors) and having at least as much transmission capacity as such satellite was designed to have. the in- orbit insurance required by this paragraph shall provide that if fifty percent (50%) or more of a satellite's initial capacity is lost, the full amount of insurance will become due and payable, and that if a satellite is able to maintain more than fifty percent (50%) but less than ninety percent (90%) of its initial capacity, a pro rata portion of such insurance will become due and payable. the insurance required by this paragraph shall name the company and/or any guarantor as the sole loss payee or payees, as the case may be, thereof. in the event that the company (or a guarantor) receives proceeds from insurance relating to any satellite, the company (or a guarantor) may use a portion of such proceeds to repay any vendor or third-party purchase money financing pertaining to such satellite (other than orion 1) that is required to be repaid by reason of the loss giving rise to such insurance proceeds. the company (or a guarantor) may use the remainder of such proceeds to develop, construct, launch and insure a replacement satellite (including components for a related ground spare) if (i) such replacement satellite is of comparable or superior technological capability as compared with the satellite being replaced and has at least as much transmission capacity as the satellite being replaced and (ii) the company will have sufficient funds to service the company's projected debt service requirements until the scheduled launch of such replacement satellite and for one (1) year thereafter and to develop, construct, launch and insure (in the amounts required by the preceding paragraph) such replacement satellite, provided that such replacement satellite is scheduled to be launched within fifteen (15) months of the receipt of such proceeds. any such proceeds not used as permitted by this paragraph shall be applied, within ninety (90) days, to reduce indebtedness of the company. the company shall further provide or cause to be provided, for itself and its restricted subsidiaries, insurance (including appropriate self-insurance) against loss or damage of the kinds considered reasonable by the company in the conduct of its business. -40- the company shall cause all properties owned by the company or any subsidiary or used or held for use in the conduct of its business or the business of any subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this section 13.12 shall prevent the company from discontinuing the maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the holders of debentures. section 12.3(b) shall cease to apply after the senior notes reduction date. 14. subordination of debentures. 14.1. debentures subordinated to senior indebtedness. the company covenants and agrees, and each holder of a debenture, whether upon original issue or upon transfer, assignment or exchange thereof by his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this section 14, the payment of the principal of and interest (except interest paid in the form of junior securities) on each and all of the debentures are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of all senior indebtedness. 14.2. liquidation; dissolution; bankruptcy. in the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding in connection therewith, relative to the company or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets, (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the company, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of assets and liabilities of the company, then and in any such event specified in (a), (b) or (c) above (each such event, if any, herein sometimes referred to as a "proceeding") the holders of senior indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all senior indebtedness, or provision shall be made for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of senior indebtedness, before the holders of the debentures are entitled to receive any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than junior securities paid as interest on the debentures), on account of principal of or interest on the debentures or on account of any purchase or other acquisition of debentures by the company or any subsidiary of the company (all such payments, distributions, purchases and acquisitions herein referred to, individually and collectively, as a "debenture payment"), and to that end the holders of all senior indebtedness shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment thereof, any debenture payment which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the debentures in any such proceeding. -41- to the extent any payment of senior indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of the company, as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar person, the senior indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the holder of any debenture shall have received any debenture payment before all senior indebtedness is paid in full or payment thereof provided for in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of senior indebtedness, then and in such event such debenture payment shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other person making payment or distribution of assets of the company for application to the payment of all senior indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all senior indebtedness in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of senior indebtedness. for purposes of this section 14 only, the words "any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include (a) any payment of interest on the debentures made solely in junior securities or (b) a payment or distribution of stock or securities of the company provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment authorized by an order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in a reorganization proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy law or of any other corporation provided for by such plan of reorganization or readjustment which stock or securities are subordinated in right of payment to all then outstanding senior indebtedness at least to the same extent as the debentures are so subordinated as provided in this section 14; provided that (1) if a new corporation results from such reorganization or readjustment, such corporation assumes the senior indebtedness and (2) the rights of the holders of the senior indebtedness are not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. the consolidation of the company with, or the merger of the company into, another person or the liquidation or dissolution or the company following the conveyance, transfer, sale or lease of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to another person upon the terms and conditions set forth in either section 12.6 or section 13.1, as then applicable, shall not be deemed a proceeding for the purposes of this section if the person formed by such consolidation or into which the company is merged or the person which acquires by conveyance, transfer, sale or lease such properties and assets, as the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, sale or lease comply with the conditions set forth in either section 12.6 or section 13.1, as then applicable. 14.3. default on senior indebtedness. in the event that any senior payment default (as defined below) shall have occurred and be continuing, then no debenture payment -42- shall be made directly or indirectly unless and until such senior payment default shall have been cured or waived, such default or the benefits of this sentence shall have been waived or shall have ceased to exist, or all amounts then due and payable in respect of senior indebtedness to which such senior payment default relates shall have been paid in full, or provision shall have been made for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of senior indebtedness. "senior payment default" means any default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on all or any portion of the senior indebtedness. in addition, in the event that any senior nonmonetary default (as defined below) shall have occurred and be continuing, then, upon the receipt by the company of written notice of such senior nonmonetary default from any holder, or a trustee on behalf of a holder of such senior indebtedness, of the senior indebtedness to which such senior nonmonetary default relates, then the company may not directly or indirectly, make any payments in respect of the debentures (other than payment of interest in shares of junior securities or payment of other subordinated securities issued in a reorganization proceeding, each as provided in the fourth paragraph of section 14.2 or payments from funds previously segregated or deposited in trust to redeem or repurchase the debentures under this purchase agreement) during the period (the "payment blockage period") commencing on the date of such receipt by the company of such written notice and ending on the earlier of (i) the date, if any, on which the senior indebtedness to which such senior nonmonetary default relates is discharged or such senior nonmonetary default shall have been cured or waived in writing or shall have ceased to exist and any acceleration of senior indebtedness to which such senior nonmonetary default relates shall have been rescinded or annulled and (ii) the one hundred seventy-ninth (179th) day after the date of such receipt of such written notice. notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, no more than one payment blockage period may be commenced with respect to the debentures during any period of three hundred sixty (360) consecutive days and there shall be a period of at least one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days in each period of three hundred sixty (360) consecutive days when no payment blockage period is in effect. following the commencement of any payment blockage period, the holders of senior indebtedness shall be precluded from commencing a subsequent payment blockage period until the conditions set forth in the preceding sentence shall have been satisfied. for all purposes of this paragraph, no senior nonmonetary default that existed or was continuing (it being acknowledged that any subsequent action that would give rise to an event of default pursuant to any provision under which an event of default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new event of default for this purpose) on the date of commencement of any payment blockage period with respect to the senior indebtedness initiating such payment blockage period shall be, or may be made, the basis for the commencement of a subsequent payment blockage period with respect to the senior indebtedness initiating such blockage period unless such senior nonmonetary default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than ninety (90) consecutive days. "senior nonmonetary default" means any default (other than a senior payment default) or any event (other than a senior payment default) which, after notice or lapse or time (or both), would become an event of default, under the terms of any senior indebtedness permitting one or more holders of such senior indebtedness or a trustee or agent on behalf of a holder of -43- senior indebtedness to declare such senior indebtedness due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise become due and payable. in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall make any debenture payment to any holder prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this section 14.3, then and in such event the company shall promptly notify the holders of senior indebtedness of such prohibited payment and such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and such debenture payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the company for the benefit of the holders of senior indebtedness. the provisions of this section shall not apply to any debenture payment with respect to which section 14.2 would be applicable. 14.4. payment permitted if no default. nothing contained in this section 14 or in any of the debentures insofar as they incorporate the provisions of this section 14 shall prevent the company, at any time except during the pendency of any proceeding referred to in section 14.2 or under the conditions described in section 14.3, from making debenture payments. 14.5. subrogation to rights of holders of senior indebtedness. subject to the payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of senior indebtedness, or the provision for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of senior indebtedness, the holders of the debentures shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such senior indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the senior indebtedness until the principal of and interest on the debentures shall be paid in full. for purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the senior indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the holders of the debentures would be entitled except for the provisions of this section 14, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of this section 14 to the holders of senior indebtedness by holders of the debentures shall, as among the company, its creditors other than holders of senior indebtedness and the holders of the debentures, be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the company to or on account of the senior indebtedness. 14.6. provisions solely to define relative rights. the provisions of this section 14 are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holders of the debentures on the one hand and the holders of senior indebtedness on the other hand. nothing contained in this section 14 or elsewhere in this agreement or in the debentures is intended to or shall (a) impair, as among the company, its creditors other than holders of senior indebtedness and the holders of the debentures, the obligation of the company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the holders of the debentures the principal of and interest on the debentures as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms; (b) affect the relative rights against the company of the holders of the debentures and creditors of the company other than the holders of senior indebtedness; or -44- (c) prevent the holder of any debenture from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this agreement subject to the rights, if any, under this section 14 of the holders of senior indebtedness to receive cash, property and securities otherwise payable or deliverable to such holder. 14.7. enforcement of subordination by holders of senior notes; no waiver of subordination provisions. each holder of a debenture by his acceptance thereof, if and so long as a debenture payment is prohibited under this section 14, irrevocably authorizes and empowers (but without imposing any obligation on, or any duty to such holder from) each holder of senior notes at any time outstanding, and such holder's representatives, to demand, sue for, collect and receive such holder's ratable share of debenture payments which are required to be paid or delivered to the holders of senior indebtedness as provided in this section 14 in any liquidation or reorganization of the company under the u.s. federal bankruptcy code (an "insolvency proceeding"), (a) to file a proof of claim or debt in the form required in an insolvency proceeding respecting such holder of senior notes' ratable share of such debenture payments in any insolvency proceeding in the name of such holders of debentures, and to prove the validity, amount and priority of such claim, and agrees that such holder is an authorized agent for purposes of federal rule of bankruptcy procedure 3001(b) (provided, however, if, and to the extent that, the holders of the senior notes (or their representatives) have not filed a proof of claim or interest with respect to the debentures in any action or case under the federal bankruptcy code at least five (5) business days prior to the last date by which all such proofs of claim or interest must be filed or forever barred, the holders of the debentures or their representatives may (but shall not be obligated to) file proofs of claim or interest with respect to the debentures); (b) to vote the claim respecting such holder of senior notes' ratable share of such debenture payments in any insolvency proceeding, including, without limitation, in a proceeding under chapter 11, title 11, united states code; and (c) to take any such actions as such holder of senior notes, or such holder's representatives, may determine to be reasonably necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the provisions set forth in (a) or (b) above. no right of any present or future holder of any senior indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of senior indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the holders of the debentures, without incurring responsibility to the holders of the debentures and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this section 14 or the obligations hereunder of the holders of the debentures to the holders of senior indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) amend or supplement in any manner senior indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which senior indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property -45- pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing senior indebtedness; (iii) release any person liable in any manner for the collection of senior indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the company and any other person. 14.8. reliance on judicial order or certificate of liquidating agent. upon any payment or distribution of assets of the company referred to in this section 14, the holders of the debentures shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the holders of debentures, for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the senior indebtedness and other indebtedness of the company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this section 14. 14.9. certain conversions deemed payment. for the purposes of this section 14 only, (i) the issuance and delivery of junior securities upon conversion of debentures in accordance with section 15 hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a debenture payment and (ii) the payment, issuance or delivery of cash, property or securities (other than junior securities) upon conversion of a debenture shall be deemed to constitute a debenture payment. for the purposes of this section 14, the term "junior securities" means shares of any capital stock. nothing contained in this section 14 or elsewhere in this agreement or in the debentures is intended to or shall impair, as among the company, its creditors other than holders of senior indebtedness and the holders of the debentures, the right, which is absolute and unconditional, of the holder of any debenture to convert such debenture in accordance with the provisions of section 15 hereof. 14.10. not to prevent events of default. the failure to make a payment on account of principal of premium, if any, or interest on the debentures by reason of any provision of this section 14 will not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an event of default. 15. conversion rights. 15.1. conversion privilege and conversion rate. subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this section 15, at the option of the holder thereof, any debenture may be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest one one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share) of common stock at the conversion rate, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. such conversion right shall commence on the date of such debenture and expire the later of (i) at the close of business on february 1, 2012 or (ii) the date the full principal amount of all of the debentures and all accrued interest thereon have been paid in full. in case any debentures are called for redemption under section 11.2 or 11.3 or the company requires holders of notes to -46- make a mandatory sale under section 11.4, such conversion right in respect of any such debenture shall be subject to the provisions of section 11.5. the rate at which shares of common stock shall be delivered upon conversion (herein called the "conversion rate") shall be initially 71.42857 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures. the conversion rate shall be adjusted in certain instances as provided in this section 15. 15.2. exercise of conversion privilege; time conversion deemed effected; delivery of stock certificates; partial conversions; accrued interest. in order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holder of any debenture to be converted shall surrender such debenture, duly endorsed or assigned to the company or in blank, at the company's principal executive offices, 2440 research boulevard, suite 400, rockville, maryland 20850 (or such other office or agency of the company as the company may designate by notice in writing to each holder of debentures), accompanied by written notice to the company at such office that the holder elects to convert such debenture or, if less than the entire principal amount thereof is to be converted, the portion thereof to be converted. a debenture shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the day of surrender of such debenture for conversion in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the holder of such debenture, as a holder thereof, shall cease to the extent of the portion of such debenture converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the conversion shares shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders thereof at such time. as promptly as practicable on or after the date of any conversion in full or in part of any debenture, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, the company shall, at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue taxes), issue and deliver to the holder of such debenture, or as such holder may direct, a certificate or certificates for the number of full conversion shares, together with (a) payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in section 15.3, and (b) interest (payable in the form of interest shares as provided in the form of the debenture) on the principal amount of such debenture, or the portion thereof converted, accrued and unpaid to and including the date of such conversion, without any adjustment in respect of any dividend or other distribution payable on the conversion shares. upon any partial conversion of a debenture, the company will forthwith issue and deliver to or upon the order of the holder thereof, at the expense of the company, a new debenture or debentures in aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid and unconverted portion of the principal amount of such partially converted debenture. such new debenture or debentures shall be registered in the name of such holder and dated as of the date of the converted debenture. 15.3. fractions of shares. no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of any debenture or debentures. if more than one (1) debenture shall be surrendered for conversion at one time (or substantially at the same time) by the same holder, -47- the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures so surrendered. in place of any fractional share of common stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any debenture or debentures, the company shall calculate and pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the current market price per share of common stock (calculated in accordance with section 15.4(8) below) at the close of business on the day of conversion. 15.4. adjustments to conversion rate. the conversion rate shall be subject to adjustments from time to time as follows: (1) in case at any time after the closing date the company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on any class of capital stock of the company (other than the series c preferred stock) in shares of its common stock, the conversion rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such conversion rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. for the purposes of this paragraph (1), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of common stock. the company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in the treasury of the company. (2) in case at any time after the closing date, the company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its common stock (not being available on an equivalent basis to holders of the debentures upon conversion) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this section 15.4) of the common stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the conversion rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing such conversion rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such current market price and the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening -48- of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. however, upon the expiration of any right or warrant to purchase common stock the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment in the conversion rate pursuant to this subsection (2), if any such right or warrant shall expire and shall not have been exercised, the conversion rate shall immediately upon such expiration be recomputed and effective immediately upon such expiration be increased to the price which it would have been (but reflecting any other adjustments in the conversion rate made pursuant to the provisions of this section 15.4 after the issuance of such rights or warrants) had the adjustment of the conversion rate made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of offering for subscription or purchase only that number of shares of common stock actually purchased upon the exercise of such rights or warrants actually exercised. for the purposes of this paragraph (2), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the company but will include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of common stock. the company will not issue any rights or warrants in respect of shares of common stock held in the treasury of the company. (3) in case at any time after the closing date, outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of common stock, the conversion rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased and, conversely, in case at any time after the date hereof, outstanding shares of common stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the conversion rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (4) in case at any time after the closing date, the company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its common stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including stock or other securities of the company or any other issuer, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in paragraph (2) of this section 15.4, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (1) of this section 15.4), the conversion rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this section 15.4) of the common stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (each reference to "fair market value" in this section 15.4 shall mean the fair market value as determined by the board of directors of the company in good faith, whose determination shall be described in a board resolution, a copy of which shall be delivered to each holder of debentures within -49- ten (10) days of the adoption of the resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one (1) share of common stock and the denominator shall be such current market price per share of the common stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. (5) in case at any time after the closing date (a) the company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its common stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which section 15.13 applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this section 15.4) and (b)(i) the total of (x) the aggregate amount of such cash distribution, (y) the aggregate amount of any other distributions to all holders of its common stock made exclusively in cash within the twelve (12) months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this section 15.4 has been made and (z) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value of other consideration payable in respect of any tender offers by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the common stock concluded within the twelve (12) months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this section 15.4 has been made, exceeds (ii) ten percent (10%) of the product of the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this section 15.4) of the common stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive such distribution times the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date, then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, the conversion rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to such current market price per share on the date fixed for such determination less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the sum of (i) the total of the amounts referred to in subclauses (b)(i)(x) and (y) of this paragraph (5) and (ii) the aggregate of the excess of the amount referred to in subclause (b)(i)(z) of this paragraph (5) for each tender offer so referred to over the aggregate current market price of the shares of common stock purchased in such tender offer as of the expiration time (as hereinafter defined) for such tender offer divided by (y) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date for determination and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to such current market price per share on such date for determination. (6) in case at any time after the closing date (a) a tender offer made by the company or any subsidiary for all or any portion of the common stock shall expire and (b)(i) the total of (x) the fair market value of the aggregate consideration required to be paid pursuant to such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the -50- terms of the tender offer) of purchased shares (as defined below)), (y) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value, as of the expiration of such tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender offer, by the company or any subsidiary for all or any portion of the common stock expiring within the twelve (12) months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (6) or paragraph (5) of this section 15.4 has been made and (z) the aggregate amount of any distributions to all holders of the company's common stock made exclusively in cash within twelve (12) months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (6) or paragraph (5) of this section 15.4 has been made, exceeds (ii) ten percent (10%) of the product of the current market price per share of the common stock (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this section 15.4) on the date of the last time (the "expiration time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the expiration time, then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the expiration time, the conversion rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by dividing the conversion rate immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the expiration time by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to (a) the product of (i) such current market price per share on the date of the expiration time and (ii) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the expiration time less (b) the total of the amounts referred to in clause (b)(i) of this paragraph (6), and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (a) such current market price per share on the date of the expiration time and (b) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the expiration time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration time (the shares deemed so accepted up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "purchased shares"). (7) the reclassification of common stock into securities other than common stock (other than any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger to which section 15.13 applies) shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than common stock to all holders of common stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this section 15.4), and (b) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (3) of this section 15.4). -51- (8) for the purpose of any computation under paragraph (2), (4), (5) or (6) of this section 15.4, the current market price per share of common stock on any date shall be calculated by the company and be deemed to be the average of the daily closing price per share of common stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days before, and ending not later than, the earlier of (i) the day in question and (ii) the day before the "ex" date with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation. for purposes of this paragraph, the term "'ex' date", when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the applicable securities exchange or in the applicable securities market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. (9) the company may make such increases in the conversion rate, for the remaining term of the debentures or any shorter term, in addition to those required by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section 15.4, as it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of common stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons. 15.5. effect on conversion price of certain events. in order to prevent dilution of the conversion rights granted under this section 15, in addition to the adjustments provided for in section 15.4, the conversion rate shall be subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to this section 15.5 as follows; provided, however, that no adjustments shall be made under this section 15.5 with respect to any issuance of securities or other event that requires an adjustment of the conversion rate under section 15.4. (1) if and whenever on or after the closing date the company issues or sells, or in accordance with this section 15.5 is deemed to have issued or sold, other than in an excluded issuance, any share of common stock for a consideration per share less than the trigger price in effect immediately prior to such time (a "dilutive event"), then forthwith upon such issue or sale in the dilutive event the conversion rate shall be increased by dividing the conversion rate in effect immediately before the dilutive event by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock that are outstanding on an as-converted basis (as defined below) immediately before the dilutive event plus the number of shares of common stock that could be purchased at the trigger price at the time of the dilutive event for the aggregate consideration paid or payable upon the sale or issuance of common stock in the dilutive event, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that are outstanding on an as-converted basis immediately before the dilutive event plus the number of shares that are acquired or to be acquired upon the sale or issuance of the common stock in the dilutive event. for purposes of this paragraph (1), "outstanding on an as-converted basis immediately before the dilutive event" means the sum of (i) all common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the dilutive event plus (ii) all common stock -52- issuable upon the exercise of options or conversion of convertible securities outstanding immediately before the dilutive event (other than the debentures). (2) if after the closing date the company in any manner grants any options and the price per share for which shares of common stock are issuable upon the exercise of any such option is less than the trigger price in effect immediately prior to the time of the granting of such option, then such shares of common stock shall be deemed to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the granting of such options for such price per share and the conversion rate shall be adjusted in accordance with paragraph (1) of this section 15.5. for purposes of this paragraph, the "price per share" for which shares of common stock are issuable upon the exercise of any option shall be equal to the sum of the amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the company with respect to such shares of common stock upon the granting of the option and upon exercise of the option. no further adjustment of the conversion rate shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon the exercise of such options. (3) if after the closing date the company in any manner issues or sells any convertible security (or options to purchase any convertible security) and the price per share for shares of common stock that are issuable upon conversion or exchange thereof is less than the trigger price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale (or the granting of such option), then such shares of common stock shall be deemed to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the issuance or sale of such convertible securities (or the granting of such option) for such price per share and the conversion price shall be adjusted in accordance with paragraph (1) of this section 15.5. for the purposes of this paragraph (3), the "price per share" for which shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion or exchange of any convertible security (or exercise of any option therefor) shall be equal to the sum of the amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the company upon the issuance of the convertible security (or such option) and upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible security (or exercise of such option). no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of any convertible security, and if any such issue or sale of such convertible security is made upon exercise of any options for which adjustments of the conversion rate had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 15, no further adjustment of the conversion rate shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. (4) if after the closing date the purchase price provided for in any option, the additional consideration (if any) payable upon the issue, conversion or exchange of any convertible security (other than the debentures), or the rate at which any convertible security (other than the debentures) is convertible into or exchangeable for common stock changes at any time, any conversion rate previously adjusted with respect to such option or convertible security (other than the debentures) and in effect -53- at the time of such change shall be readjusted to the conversion rate which would have been in effect at such time had such option or convertible security (other than the debentures) originally provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. (5) upon the expiration of any option or the termination of any right to convert or exchange any convertible security (other than the debentures), after the closing date, without the exercise of any such option or right, any conversion rate then in effect hereunder shall be adjusted to the conversion rate which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such option or convertible security, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued. (6) for the purpose of this section 15.5, if any common stock, option or convertible security is issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the company therefor. in case any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the market price thereof as of the date of receipt. if any common stock, option or convertible security is issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the company is the surviving corporation, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such common stock, options or convertible securities, as the case may be. the fair value of any consideration other than cash and securities shall be as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company. for purposes of this paragraph (6), the term "market price" of a security means, with respect to a specified date, the closing price of such security, averaged over a period of the twenty (20) consecutive business days prior to such date; provided that if during this period such security is not listed on any securities exchange, quoted on the nasdaq national market, or quoted in the over-the-counter market, the market price will be the fair value of such security determined by agreement between the company and the holders of a majority of the outstanding debentures. if such parties are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time, the fair value of such security shall be determined by an independent appraiser experienced in valuing such type of consideration jointly selected by the company and the holders of a majority of the outstanding debentures. the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the company. (7) in case any option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the company, together comprising one (1) integrated transaction in -54- which no specific consideration is allocated to such option by the parties thereto, the option shall be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. 15.6. de minimis adjustments. notwithstanding any other provisions of this section 15, the company shall not be required to make any adjustment of the conversion rate unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the conversion rate as then in effect. any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made no later than the time of, and together with, the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the conversion rate as then in effect. 15.7. notice of adjustments of conversion rate. whenever the conversion rate is adjusted as provided in section 15.4 or section 15.5, the company shall promptly (and, in any event, not later than the fifteenth (15th) day following the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment) compute the adjusted conversion rate in accordance with this section 15 and shall prepare a report setting forth such adjustment and showing in detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such adjustment is based, including a statement of (a) the consideration received or to be received by the company for any additional shares of common stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued, (b) the number of shares of common stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale and as adjusted on account therefor and, upon the request of any holder of the debentures, shall cause certified public accountants of recognized national standing (which may be the regular auditors of the company) selected by the company to verify such computation and report, if not previously verified at the request of any holder. the company will promptly (and, in any event, not later than such fifteenth (15th) day) furnish a copy of each such report and such verification to the holder of any debenture, and will, upon the written request at any reasonable time of the holder of any debenture, furnish to such holder a like report setting forth the conversion rate at the time in effect and showing how it was calculated. the company will also keep copies of all such reports and such verifications at its principal office, and will cause the same to be available for inspection at such office during normal business hours by the holder of any debenture or any prospective purchaser of any debenture designated by the holder of such debenture. 15.8. notice of certain corporate action. in case: (1) the company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its common stock payable otherwise than in cash out of its earned surplus; or (2) the company shall authorize the granting to all holders of its common stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock or of any other rights; or (3) (a) of any reclassification of the common stock of the company, or (b) of any consolidation, merger or share exchange to which the company is a party -55- and for which approval of any stockholders of the company is required, or (c) of any tender offer by the company or any subsidiary for all or any portion of the common stock, or (d) of the conveyance, transfer, sale or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the company; or (4) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company; then the company, ten (10) business days prior to the applicable record, expiration or effective date hereinafter specified, shall give to each holder of debentures a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the effective date as of which the holders of common stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined, (y) the date on which the right to make tenders under such tender offer expires or (z) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, conveyance, transfer, sale, lease, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of common stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, conveyance, transfer, sale, lease, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. 15.9. company to reserve common stock. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued common stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of debentures, the full number of conversion shares then issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding debentures. 15.10. taxes on conversions. the company will pay any and all taxes (other than taxes on income), liens and other charges that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of conversion shares pursuant hereto. 15.11. agreements as to common stock;

and 5(p) use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission and make generally available to its security holders in a regular filing on form 10-q or form 10-k or otherwise provide in accordance with section 11(a) of the securities act within the period required after the effective date of the applicable registration statement an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and rule 158 thereof. the company may require each holder of registrable securities (i) to furnish to the company such information regarding the proposed distribution by such holder of such registrable securities as the company may from time to time reasonably request in writing, and -121- (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement and securities sales agreement in the form contemplated by section 5(i). each holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 5(e) hereof, such holder will immediately discontinue disposition of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement until such holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 5(e) hereof, and, if so directed by the company, such holder will deliver to the company (at the expense of the company) all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such registrable securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. if the company shall give any such notice to suspend the disposition of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement, the company shall extend the period during which the registration statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the holders shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. (f) hold-back agreements. 6(a) restrictions on public sale by holders. by electing to include registrable securities in a registration statement filed pursuant to section 3 or section 4 hereof, each such holder of registrable securities shall be deemed to have agreed not to effect any public sale or public distribution of securities of the company of the same or similar class or classes of the securities included in the registration statement or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 or rule 144a under the securities act, during the 15-day period prior to, and during such period of time as may be required by the underwriters, but not to exceed a 180-day period beginning on, the effective date of the registration statement (except pursuant to the registration statement), except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the managing underwriter. 6(b) restrictions on public sale by the company. the company shall not effect any public sale or public distribution of any securities which are the same as or substantially similar to the registrable securities being registered pursuant to a registration statement filed pursuant to section 3 or section 4 hereof, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities during the 15-day period prior to, and during the 180-day period beginning on, the effective date of a registration statement (except pursuant to the registration statement). (g) black-out periods for shelf registration statements. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, (a) commencing ninety (90) days after the effectiveness of a shelf registration statement, the company may, not more than once in any 12-month period, and one additional time during the term of this agreement (but not during any other suspension event or within ninety (90) days after termination of any other suspension event), direct the holders to suspend sales of registrable securities registered thereunder, as provided herein, if one or more of the following events (a -122- "suspension event") occurs: (i) an underwritten primary offering by the company where the company is advised by the managing underwriter(s) for such offering that sale of registrable securities under the shelf registration statement would have a material adverse effect on the primary offering, or (ii) pending negotiations relating to, or consummation of, a material corporate transaction (x) that would require additional disclosure of material information by the company in the shelf registration statement (or such filings), (y) as to which the company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving confidentiality and (z) which renders the company unable to comply with sec requirements, in each case under circumstances that would make it impractical or inadvisable to cause the shelf registration statement (or such filings) to become effective or to promptly amend or supplement the shelf registration statement on a post-effective basis, as applicable; and (b) the company may, not more than once during the term of this agreement, direct the holders to suspend sales of registrable securities registered thereunder, as provided herein, upon the commencement (or such earlier date as may be required by law) of an underwritten secondary offering covering not less than 5,250,000 series c securities, with an aggregate minimum market value of $75,000,000 (a "series c offering event"). in the case of a suspension event, the company may give notice (a "suspension notice") to the holders to suspend sales of the registrable securities so that the company may correct or update the shelf registration statement (or such filings). each such suspension shall continue only for so long as the suspension event or its effect is continuing, and in no event will any such suspension exceed ninety (90) days. in the case of a series c offering event, the company may give notice (also a "suspension notice") to the holders to suspend sales of registrable securities for so long as the company reasonably determines is necessary and in no event shall such suspension exceed the date one hundred and eighty (180) days after the close of the series c offering event. the holders agree that they will not effect any sales of the registrable securities pursuant to such shelf registration statement (or such filings) at any time after they have received a suspension notice from the company. if so directed by the company, the holders will deliver to the company all copies of the prospectus covering the registrable securities held by them at the time of receipt of the suspension notice. the holders may recommence effecting sales of the registrable securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement (or such filings) following further notice to such effect (an "end of suspension notice") from the company, which end of suspension notice shall, in the case of a suspension event, be given by the company not later than five (5) days after the conclusion of any suspension event and shall be accompanied by copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to resume such sales. in the case of a series c offering event, the holders may recommence effecting sales immediately following the conclusion of the one hundred and eighty (180) day period. notwithstanding section 2, if the company shall give a suspension notice pursuant to this section 7, the company shall extend the period during which the shelf registration statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this agreement by the number of days during the period from the date of the giving of the suspension notice to and including the date when the holders shall have received the end of suspension notice and copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to resume sales. -123- (h) indemnification. 8(a) indemnification by the company. the company shall indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each holder of registrable securities, each person who controls such holder (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act) and their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives, against all losses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which made, not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the company by such holder expressly for use therein or by such holder's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the company has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same and except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any prospectus if such holder failed to send or deliver a copy of any subsequent prospectus or prospectus supplement which would have corrected such untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or such omission or alleged omission of a material fact with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale by such holder after the company has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same. in connection with an underwritten offering, the company will indemnify such underwriters, each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the securities exchange act) and their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of registrable securities. 8(b) indemnification by holders. in connection with any registration statement in which holders of registrable securities are participating, each such holder will furnish to the company in writing such information as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, will indemnify the company, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act) and their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives against any losses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or form of prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which made, not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue or alleged untrue statement is contained in, or such omission or alleged omission is required to be contained in, any information so furnished in writing by such holder to the company expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus and that such statement or omission was relied upon by the company in preparation of such registration statement, prospectus or form of prospectus; provided, however, that such holder of registrable securities shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that the holder has furnished in writing to the company prior to the filing of any such registration statement or prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto information expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto which corrected or made not misleading, information previously furnished to the company, and the company -124- failed to include such information therein. in no event shall the liability of any selling holder of registrable securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of payment of all expenses) received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such indemnified party. 8(c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any person shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder such indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the party or parties from which such indemnity is sought of the commencement of any proceeding with respect to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying parties shall not relieve the indemnifying parties from any obligation or liability except to the extent that the indemnifying parties have been prejudiced by such failure. the indemnifying parties shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to an indemnified party promptly after the receipt of written notice from such indemnified party of such proceeding, to assume, at the indemnifying parties' expense, the defense of any such proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that an indemnified party or parties (if more than one such indemnified party is named in any proceeding) shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the parties to such proceeding include both the indemnified party or parties and the indemnifying party or parties, and there exists, in the opinion of the parties' counsel, a conflict between one or more indemnifying parties and one or more indemnified parties, in which case the indemnifying parties shall, in connection with any one such proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for such indemnified party or parties. if an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such proceeding, the indemnifying, parties will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its or their consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). 8(d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold such indemnified party harmless for any losses in respect of which this section 8 would otherwise apply by its terms, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have an obligation to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection -125- with any proceeding, to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such expenses under section 8(c), if the indemnification provided for in section 8(a) or section 8(b) was available to such party. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 8(d), an indemnifying party that is a selling holder of registrable securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such indemnifying party exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person adjudged guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (i) miscellaneous. 9(a) amendments and waivers. the provisions of this agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the company has obtained the written consent of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities; provided, however, that no amendment, modification or supplement or waiver or consent to the departure with respect to the provisions of section 2, section 3, section 4, section 7, or section 8 hereof shall be effective as against any holder of registrable securities unless consented to in writing by such holder of registrable securities. 9(b) notices. all notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered first-class mail, telex, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery (i) if to a holder, at the most current address given by such holder to the company by means of a notice given in accordance with the provisions of this section 9(b) (ii) if to the company, at 2440 research boulevard, suite 400, rockville, md 20850, attention: general counsel, and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions of this section 9(b). all such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five business days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next business day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. 9(c) successors and assigns. this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent holders. if any successor, assignee or transferee of any holder shall acquire registrable securities, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such registrable securities shall be held subject to the terms of this agreement, and by taking and holding such registrable securities such person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof and shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by all of the terms and provisions hereof. notwithstanding the -126- foregoing, only matra, as a holder of registrable securities, may request an underwritten offering pursuant to section 3(a) with respect to registrable securities with a market value, as of the date of such request, of less than $20 million. 9(d) counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in, separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 9(e) headings. the headings in this agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. 9(f) governing law;

post-effective amendment declared effective by the commission as soon as practicable after filing. the company shall use its best efforts to keep each top-up shelf registration statement continuously effective for the registration period, or such shorter period which will terminate when all of the registrable securities covered by such top-up shelf registration statement, as amended from time to time pursuant to this section 2(b), have been sold pursuant to such top-up shelf registration statement. notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth below, any holder who does not provide information reasonably requested by the company in connection with the top-up shelf registration statement shall not be entitled to have its registrable securities included in the top-up shelf registration statement. 2(c) effective registration statement, amendments. a shelf registration statement pursuant to this section 2 will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the commission; provided, however that if, after it has been declared effective, the offering of any registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or any other governmental agency or court, such registration statement will be deemed not to have become effective, and the company shall be required to continue to use its best efforts to -6- have such registration statement declared effective. further, the company shall, if necessary, supplement or amend each shelf registration statement, if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the company for such shelf registration statement or by the securities act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration. 2(d) expenses. the company shall pay any and all registration expenses incident to the filing of each shelf registration statement or otherwise incident to the performance of or compliance by the company with this section 2. each holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such holder's registrable securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement. 3. demand registration of underwritten offerings. 3(a) requests for underwritten registration. at any time following one hundred eighty (180) days after the closing date, one or more holders may request that the company effect a registration under the securities act of all or any of their registrable securities in an underwritten offering; provided, however, that, unless the requesting holder is matra, the requesting holders must request registration of registrable securities with a market value, on the date of such request, of at least $20 million; and provided, further, that if the requesting holder is matra, matra must request registration of registrable securities with a market value, as of the date of such request, of at least $10 million. each request for an underwritten offering shall specify the approximate number of shares of registrable securities requested to be registered and the anticipated per share price range for such offering. within ten (10) days after receipt of any such request, the company will give written notice of such requested demand registration to all other holders and, subject to section 3(b), will include in any such registration which constitutes an underwritten offering satisfying the requirements of this section 3(a), all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein within fifteen (15) days after the date the company's notice is given. 3(b) priority on underwritten offering. if the managing underwriters for an underwritten offering advise the company in writing that in their reasonable opinion the aggregate number of registrable securities to be included in an underwritten offering (together with any other shares of common stock which the company is required to include in such registration) exceeds the number of shares which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the holders of a majority of the registrable securities and other registrable stock requested to be included in such registration, the company will include in such registration (i) first, the maximum amount of registrable securities requested to be included therein, pro rata among the respective holders thereof on the basis of the amount of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by each such holder, and (ii) second, the maximum amount of other registrable stock and any other securities requested to be included therein (including by the company, subject to section 3(e)), pro rata among the company and the holders of such other registrable stock and other securities on the basis of -7- the number of shares requested to be included in such registration by the company and each such holder, in each case up to the greatest number of shares of common stock which in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters can be sold in an orderly manner in the price range of such offering. in no event shall any other registrable stock or any other securities be included in an underwritten offering under this section 3 unless all registrable securities requested to be sold in any such offering have been included therein. 3(c) restrictions on underwritten offerings. the company will not be obligated to effect more than one underwritten offering for holders of registrable securities within any twelve (12) month period, except as provided in the following sentence, and will not be obligated to effect an underwritten offering for holders of registrable securities at any time before ninety (90) days after the earlier of (i) the date the previous registration statement prepared in connection with an underwritten offering for holders of registrable securities ceases to be effective or (ii) the date that all shares registered thereunder have been sold. the foregoing limitation on underwritten offerings within any twelve (12) month period shall not apply to a single underwritten offering with respect to registrable securities of any holder (other than matra) if the company effected an underwritten offering made at matra's request within the preceding twelve (12) months or to a single underwritten offering requested by matra if the company effected an underwritten offering with respect to registrable securities of any other holder within the preceding twelve (12) months. 3(d) selection of underwriters. the holders of a majority of the registrable securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering will have the right to select the managing underwriter(s) to administer the offering; provided, first, that if the company is successful in obtaining the services of one or more underwriters who have been the managing underwriters for an underwritten offering of the company's securities previously, such underwriters shall be the managing underwriter(s) to administer the offering; provided, however, that such managing underwriter(s) shall be nationally recognized investment banking firms approved by the holders, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided, second, that if the company participates in the underwritten offering under section 3(e), such holders shall obtain the company's consent with respect to any managing underwriter(s) to administer the offering, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 3(e) inclusion by the company of its common stock in an underwritten offering. if the managing underwriters for an underwritten offering advise the company in writing that in their opinion the aggregate number of registrable securities to be included in an underwritten offering (together with any other registrable stock) is less than the number of shares which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the holders of a majority of the registrable securities and other registrable stock requested to be included in such registration, the company may include in such registration, on its own behalf, up to the greatest number of shares of common stock which in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold (together with the registrable securities and other registrable stock requested to be included in such registration) in an orderly manner in the price range of such offering. -8- 3(f) participation in underwritten registrations. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 3 to the contrary, no person may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided in the applicable underwriting arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; provided, however, that no holder of registrable securities included in any underwritten offering shall be required to make any representations or warranties to the company or the underwriters other than representations and warranties regarding such holder and such holder's intended method of distribution. 3(g) expenses of underwriting offering. the company shall pay any and all registration expenses incident to the filing of each registration statement or otherwise incident to the performance of or compliance by the company with this section 3. each holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such holder's registrable securities included in the underwritten offering. 3(h) relationship to shelf registration. the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under section 3 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, their respective rights and obligations under section 2. 4. piggyback registration rights. 4(a) requests for piggyback registration. if at any time following the date of this agreement, the company proposes to effect a piggyback registration, the company will give written notice to all holders of its intention to effect such a registration and, subject to section 4(b) and section 4(c), will include in such registration all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein within fifteen (15) days after the date the company's notice is given. 4(b) priority on primary registrations. if the proposed piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the company, and the managing underwriters advise the company in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering in an orderly manner within a price range acceptable to the company, the company will include in such registration (i) first, the securities the company proposes to sell and the high priority registrable securities (as defined in the recent prraa), pro rata among the company and the holders of such high priority registrable securities on the basis of the number of shares requested to be included by the company and each such holder, (ii) second, any other registrable stock requested to be included therein, pro rata among the holders of such other registrable stock on the basis of the number of shares requested to be included in such registration by each such holder, and (iii) third, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among the holders thereof on the basis of the amount of registrable securities requested to be included by each such holder, in each case up to the -9- greatest number of shares of common stock which in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters can be sold in an orderly manner in the price range of such offering. 4(c) priority on secondary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the company's securities (other than the registrable securities), and the managing underwriters advise the company in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, the company will include in such registration (a) if such registration is on behalf of holders of the eligible series c securities, (i) first, the securities requested to be included in such registration under the series c registration rights agreement, and (ii) second, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration and any other registrable stock (excluding eligible series c securities) and any other securities requested to be included therein (including by the company, subject to section 3(e)), pro rata among such holders and the holders of such other registrable stock and other securities on the basis of the number of shares requested to be included in such registration by each such holder, in each case up to the greatest number of shares of common stock which in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters can be sold in an orderly manner in the price range of such offering; or (b) if such registration is not on behalf of holders of the eligible series c securities (i) first, the securities requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration, and (ii) second, the greatest number of the registrable securities, other registrable stock and any other securities requested to be included therein (including by the company, subject to section 3(e)), pro rata among such holders and the holders of such other registrable stock and other securities on the basis of the number of shares requested to be included in such registration by each such holder, in each case up to the greatest number of shares of common stock which in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters can be sold in an orderly manner in the price range of such offering. 4(d) participation in piggyback registrations. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 4 to the contrary, no person may participate in any piggyback registrations hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided in the applicable underwriting arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; provided, however, that no holder of registrable securities included in any piggyback registration shall be required to make any representations or warranties to the company or the underwriters other than representations and warranties regarding such holder and such holder's intended method of distribution. 4(e) expenses of piggyback registration. the company shall pay any and all registration expenses incident to the filing of each registration statement or otherwise incident to the performance of or compliance by the company with this section 4. each holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such holder's registrable securities included in the piggyback registration. -10- 5. registration procedures. in connection with the obligations of the company with respect to a registration statement pursuant to section 2, section 3 or section 4 hereof, the company shall effect or cause to be effected the registration of the registrable securities under the securities act to permit the sale of such registrable securities by the holders in accordance with their intended method or methods of distribution, and the company shall: 5(a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective within the time period required hereunder (provided that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the company will furnish to one counsel selected by the holders of 70% of the registrable securities (together with any other registrable stock) covered by such registration statement copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review of such counsel, and the company will incorporate in such registration statement the reasonable comments of such counsel not inconsistent with the company's disclosure obligations under applicable securities laws; 5(b) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for the period required hereunder (or if no period is so required, a period of not less than one hundred eighty (180) days or such shorter period which is sufficient to complete the distribution of the securities registered under the registration statement) and comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement; 5(c) furnish to each seller of registrable securities, the managing underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel, not less than five (5) business days prior to the filing thereof with the commission, such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by such seller and to use its best efforts to reflect in each such document, when so filed with the commission, such comments as the sellers of registrable securities or their counsel shall reasonably propose; 5(d) use its best efforts to register or qualify such registrable securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any seller reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the registrable securities owned by such seller (provided that the company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this -11- subparagraph, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction); 5(e) notify each seller of such registrable securities as promptly as practicable in any of the following circumstances: (i) at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, at the request of any such seller, the company will prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) when a registration statement and any amendment thereto has been filed with the commission and when the registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective; (iii) of any request by the commission for amendment or supplements to the registration statement or the prospectus included therein or for additional information; (iv) of the issuance by the commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; and (v) the receipt by the company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the securities included therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose; 5(f) cause all such registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed and, if not so listed, to be listed on the nasd automated quotation system and, if listed on the nasd automated quotation system, use its best efforts to secure designation of all such registrable securities covered by such registration statement as a nasdaq "national market system security" within the meaning of rule 11aa2-1 of the exchange act or, failing that, to secure nasdaq authorization for such registrable securities and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to arrange for at least two market makers to register as such with respect to such registrable securities with the nasd; 5(g) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such registrable securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement; 5(h) if requested, promptly incorporate in any registration statement or prospectus, if necessary, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment to such registration statement, such information as the managing underwriters, if any, or the holders of a majority of registrable securities and other registrable securities being registered reasonably request to have included therein and shall make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the company is notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; 5(i) enter into such agreements on terms reasonably acceptable to the company (including underwriting agreements) in form, scope and substance as are customary in -12- underwritten offerings, and take all other reasonable actions necessary to facilitate the registration or the disposition of the registrable securities included in any registration statement; 5(j) (i) make reasonably available at reasonable times for inspection by the holders of registrable securities to be registered thereunder, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the holders or such underwriters, at the office where normally kept during normal business hours, all financial and other records, pertinent corporation documents and properties of the company and its subsidiaries, and cause the company's officers, directors and employees to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the holders, or any underwriters, attorney, accountant or other agent in connection with the registration statement as is customary for similar due diligence examinations, provided, however, that such persons shall first agree in writing with the company that any information that is reasonably and in good faith designated by the company in writing as confidential at the time of delivery of such information shall be kept confidential by such persons; (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the company and updates thereof (which counsel, if different from counsel to the company referred to in the debenture purchase agreement, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be registered thereunder, the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel) addressed to each selling holder covering such matters in form, scope and substance as are customary in underwritten offerings; (iii) obtain "cold comfort" letters (or, in the case of any person that does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of a "cold comfort" letter specified in statement on auditing standards no. 72, an "agreed-upon procedures letter") and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the company or of any business acquired by the company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the registration statement), addressed where reasonably practicable to each selling holder of registrable securities registered thereunder, and the underwriters, if any, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings; and (iv) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities and other registrable securities to be registered and the managing underwriters, if any, including those to evidence compliance with section 5(e). the foregoing actions set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section 5(j) shall be performed at (a) the effectiveness of such registration statement and each post-effective amendment thereto and (b) each closing under any underwriting or similar agreement as and to the extent required thereunder; 5(k) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission; 5(l) use its best efforts to cause such registrable securities covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities; -13- 5(m) take all such action as may be necessary so that (i) any registration statement and any amendment thereto and any prospectus forming part thereof and any amendment or supplement thereto (and each report or other document incorporated therein by reference in each case) complies in all material respects with the securities act and the exchange act and the respective rules and regulations thereunder; (ii) any registration statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (iii) any prospectus forming part of any registration statement, and any amendment or supplement to such prospectus, does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 5(n) use its best efforts to prevent the issuance, and if issued to obtain the withdrawal, of any order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement at the earliest possible time; 5(o) unless any registrable securities shall be in book-entry form, cooperate with the holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing registrable securities to be sold pursuant to any registration statement free of any restrictive legend and in such permitted denominations and registered in such names as the holders may request in connection with the sale of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement; and 5(p) use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission and make generally available to its security holders in a regular filing on form 10-q or form 10-k or otherwise provide in accordance with section

securities act and rule 158 thereof. the company may require each holder of registrable securities (i) to furnish to the company such information regarding the proposed distribution by such holder of such registrable securities as the company may from time to time reasonably request in writing, and (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement and securities sales agreement in the form contemplated by section 5(i). each holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 5(e) hereof, such holder will immediately discontinue disposition of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement until such holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 5(e) hereof, and, if so directed by the company, such holder will deliver to the company (at the expense of the company) all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such registrable securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. if the company shall give any such notice to -14- suspend the disposition of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement, the company shall extend the period during which the registration statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the holders shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. 6. hold-back agreements. 6(a) restrictions on public sale by holders. by electing to include registrable securities in a registration statement filed pursuant to section 3 or section 4 hereof, each such holder of registrable securities shall be deemed to have agreed not to effect any public sale or public distribution of securities of the company of the same or similar class or classes of the securities included in the registration statement or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 or rule 144a under the securities act, during the 15-day period prior to, and during such period of time as may be required by the underwriters, but not to exceed a 180-day period beginning on, the effective date of the registration statement (except pursuant to the registration statement), except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the managing underwriter. 6(b) restrictions on public sale by the company. the company shall not effect any public sale or public distribution of any securities which are the same as or substantially similar to the registrable securities being registered pursuant to a registration statement filed pursuant to section 3 or section 4 hereof, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities during the 15-day period prior to, and during the 180-day period beginning on, the effective date of a registration statement (except pursuant to the registration statement). 7. black-out periods for shelf registration statements. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, (a) commencing ninety (90) days after the effectiveness of a shelf registration statement, the company may, not more than once in any 12-month period, and one additional time during the term of this agreement (but not during any other suspension event or within ninety (90) days after termination of any other suspension event), direct the holders to suspend sales of registrable securities registered thereunder, as provided herein, if one or more of the following events (a "suspension event") occurs: (i) an underwritten primary offering by the company where the company is advised by the managing underwriter(s) for such offering that sale of registrable securities under the shelf registration statement would have a material adverse effect on the primary offering, or (ii) pending negotiations relating to, or consummation of, a material corporate transaction (x) that would require additional disclosure of material information by the company in the shelf registration statement (or such filings), (y) as to which the company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving confidentiality and (z) which renders the company unable to comply with sec requirements, in each case under circumstances that would make it -15- impractical or inadvisable to cause the shelf registration statement (or such filings) to become effective or to promptly amend or supplement the shelf registration statement on a post-effective basis, as applicable; and (b) the company may, not more than once during the term of this agreement, direct the holders to suspend sales of registrable securities registered thereunder, as provided herein, upon the commencement (or such earlier date as may be required by law) of an underwritten secondary offering covering not less than 5,250,000 series c securities, with an aggregate minimum market value of $75,000,000 (a "series c offering event"). in the case of a suspension event, the company may give notice (a "suspension notice") to the holders to suspend sales of the registrable securities so that the company may correct or update the shelf registration statement (or such filings). each such suspension shall continue only for so long as the suspension event or its effect is continuing, and in no event will any such suspension exceed ninety (90) days. in the case of a series c offering event, the company may give notice (also a "suspension notice") to the holders to suspend sales of registrable securities for so long as the company reasonably determines is necessary and in no event shall such suspension exceed the date one hundred and eighty (180) days after the close of the series c offering event. the holders agree that they will not effect any sales of the registrable securities pursuant to such shelf registration statement (or such filings) at any time after they have received a suspension notice from the company. if so directed by the company, the holders will deliver to the company all copies of the prospectus covering the registrable securities held by them at the time of receipt of the suspension notice. the holders may recommence effecting sales of the registrable securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement (or such filings) following further notice to such effect (an "end of suspension notice") from the company, which end of suspension notice shall, in the case of a suspension event, be given by the company not later than five (5) days after the conclusion of any suspension event and shall be accompanied by copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to resume such sales. in the case of a series c offering event, the holders may recommence effecting sales immediately following the conclusion of the one hundred and eighty (180) day period. notwithstanding section 2, if the company shall give a suspension notice pursuant to this section 7, the company shall extend the period during which the shelf registration statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this agreement by the number of days during the period from the date of the giving of the suspension notice to and including the date when the holders shall have received the end of suspension notice and copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to resume sales. 8. indemnification. 8(a) indemnification by the company. the company shall indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each holder of registrable securities, each person who controls such holder (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act) and their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives, -16- against all losses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which made, not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the company by such holder expressly for use therein or by such holder's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the company has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same and except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any prospectus if such holder failed to send or deliver a copy of any subsequent prospectus or prospectus supplement which would have corrected such untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or such omission or alleged omission of a material fact with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale by such holder after the company has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same. in connection with an underwritten offering, the company will indemnify such underwriters, each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the securities exchange act) and their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of registrable securities. 8(b) indemnification by holders. in connection with any registration statement in which holders of registrable securities are participating, each such holder will furnish to the company in writing such information as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, will indemnify the company, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act) and their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives against any losses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or form of prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which made, not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue or alleged untrue statement is contained in, or such omission or alleged omission is required to be contained in, any information so furnished in writing by such holder to the company expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus and that such statement or omission was relied upon by the company in preparation of such registration statement, prospectus or form of prospectus; provided, however, that such holder of registrable securities shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that the holder has furnished in writing to the company prior to the filing of any such registration statement or prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto information expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto which corrected or made not misleading, information previously furnished to the company, and the company failed to include such information therein. in no event shall the liability of any selling holder of registrable securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of payment of all expenses) received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable -17- securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such indemnified party. 8(c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any person shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder such indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the party or parties from which such indemnity is sought of the commencement of any proceeding with respect to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying parties shall not relieve the indemnifying parties from any obligation or liability except to the extent that the indemnifying parties have been prejudiced by such failure. the indemnifying parties shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to an indemnified party promptly after the receipt of written notice from such indemnified party of such proceeding, to assume, at the indemnifying parties' expense, the defense of any such proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that an indemnified party or parties (if more than one such indemnified party is named in any proceeding) shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the parties to such proceeding include both the indemnified party or parties and the indemnifying party or parties, and there exists, in the opinion of the parties' counsel, a conflict between one or more indemnifying parties and one or more indemnified parties, in which case the indemnifying parties shall, in connection with any one such proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for such indemnified party or parties. if an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such proceeding, the indemnifying, parties will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its or their consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). 8(d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold such indemnified party harmless for any losses in respect of which this section 8 would otherwise apply by its terms, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have an obligation to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection -18- with any proceeding, to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such expenses under section 8(c), if the indemnification provided for in section 8(a) or section 8(b) was available to such party. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 8(d), an indemnifying party that is a selling holder of registrable securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such indemnifying party exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person adjudged guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 9. miscellaneous. 9(a) amendments and waivers. the provisions of this agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the company has obtained the written consent of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities; provided, however, that no amendment, modification or supplement or waiver or consent to the departure with respect to the

delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. 9(c) successors and assigns. this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent holders. if any successor, assignee or transferee of any holder shall acquire registrable securities, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such registrable securities shall be held -19- subject to the terms of this agreement, and by taking and holding such registrable securities such person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof and shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by all of the terms and provisions hereof. notwithstanding the foregoing, only matra, as a holder of registrable securities, may request an underwritten offering pursuant to section 3(a) with respect to registrable securities with a market value, as of the date of such request, of less than $20 million. 9(d) counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in, separate counterparts, each of which when so
