reporting person shares voting power solely with respect to those matters described in such item. 3 page 3 of 136 item 1. security and issuer. this statement on schedule 13d relates to shares of common stock, no par value ("common stock"), of starsight telecast, inc., a california corporation (the "issuer"). the principal executive offices of the issuer are located at 39650 liberty street, fremont, california 94538. item 2. identity and background. this statement is being filed by gemstar international group limited, a british virgin islands corporation ("gemstar"). gemstar's principal business involves the development, marketing and licensing of proprietary technologies and systems that simplify and enhance the viewing and recording of video and television programming. the address of its principal executive office in the united states is 135 north los robles avenue, suite 800, pasadena, california 91101. the directors and executive officers of gemstar are set forth on schedule a attached hereto. schedule a sets forth the following information with respect to each such person: (a) name; (b) residence or business address; (c) present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted; and (d) citizenship. during the last five years, neither gemstar, nor any person named in schedule a attached hereto, has been (a) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (b) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. on december 23, 1996, gemstar, through its wholly owned subsidiary g/s acquisition subsidiary, a california corporation ("sub"), agreed to acquire the issuer by means of a merger (the "merger") pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of december 23, 1996, by and between gemstar, sub and the issuer (the "merger agreement"). concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, gemstar and the issuer also entered into a company option agreement, dated as of december 23, 1996 (the "company option agreement"), which agreement is described in more detail in item 6 below, pursuant to which gemstar has been granted an option by the issuer to purchase up to 5,276,034 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $10.46 per share (the "stock option"). the stock option is, however, exercisable only upon the occurrence of those events relating to the merger specifically set forth in the merger agreement and the company option agreement, none of which has occurred as of the date upon which this statement on schedule 13d is being filed. if the stock option should ever become exercisable, it is anticipated that gemstar would use working capital to effect the exercise thereof. the terms of the stock option are more fully described in the company option agreement and the merger agreement. the company option agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 1. the merger agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 2. each of such documents is incorporated herein by this reference. no capital is expected to be expended by gemstar in connection with the exercise of its rights with respect to the 16,861,556 shares of common stock covered by the company significant shareholder agreement described in item 6 below. 4 page 4 of 136 item 4. purpose of transaction. see items 3 and 6. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. as a result of the stock option being granted to gemstar, gemstar may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 5,276,034 shares of common stock (assuming exercise of the stock option). as a result of the company significant shareholder agreement described in item 6 below, gemstar may also be deemed to be the beneficial owner of an additional 16,861,556 shares of common stock. in aggregate, such shares (representing a total of 22,137,590 shares of common stock) would represent approximately 71.8% of the shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to the exercise of the stock option. except as described herein, neither gemstar, nor any person named in schedule a attached hereto, has acquired or disposed of any shares of common stock during the past sixty days. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships to securities of the issuer. this statement on schedule 13d relates to (i) the stock option granted to gemstar by the issuer pursuant to the company option agreement and (ii) the company significant shareholder agreement, dated as of december 23, 1996 (the "shareholder agreement"), by and between gemstar and certain shareholders of the issuer listed on the signature pages thereof (collectively, the "shareholders"). the stock option was granted by the issuer, and the shareholder agreement entered into by the shareholders, as an inducement to gemstar to enter into the merger agreement. under the terms of the merger agreement, sub will, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, merge with and into the issuer, with each share of common stock issued and outstanding as of the effective time of the merger, other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with the merger agreement and any dissenting shares (as defined in the merger agreement), being converted, as provided in the merger agreement, into .6062 shares of gemstar ordinary shares, $.01 par value per share. the shareholder agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 3 and is incorporated herein by this reference. if the merger is consummated as planned, the common stock will be deregistered under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act") and cease to be listed on the nasdaq national market system. upon consummation of the merger, the directors of the issuer immediately prior to the merger will be deemed to have resigned at such time and the directors of sub prior to the merger will be the directors of the issuer, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. the officers of the issuer immediately prior to the merger will become the officers of the issuer, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. upon any termination of the merger agreement pursuant to section 7.1(h), (j) or (l) of the merger agreement or upon the failure of any of the shareholders to vote in favor of the merger at a duly held meeting of the issuer's shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof and, in connection with such vote, the merger is not approved by the shareholders of the issuer, the issuer, upon written notice from gemstar at any time of gemstar's election to receive a termination fee equal to $15 million (the "company termination fee") in lieu of gemstar exercising the stock option (the "company termination fee notice"), must immediately pay to gemstar the company termination fee. following any termination of the merger agreement pursuant to section 7.1(h), (j) or (l) of the merger agreement, the issuer must give gemstar at least 30 days' (and not more than 45 days') prior written notice of the closing date of any company takeover proposal (as such term is defined in the merger agreement), and gemstar, if it elects to receive the company termination fee upon such closing, shall give written notice to the issuer (the "company payment notice") at least five days' prior to such closing (which notice shall be effective only upon such closing), and the issuer must pay 5 page 5 of 136 the company termination fee upon such closing. if gemstar has not delivered the company payment notice within such time frame, then upon (and only upon) the closing of a company takeover proposal, gemstar's right to receive the company termination fee will terminate. the stock option is exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time following the occurrence of a purchase event (as defined below) and prior to termination of the company option agreement. a "purchase event" means any termination of the merger agreement pursuant to section 7.1(h), (j) or (l) thereof. the stock option will terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) the later to occur of (a) 18 months from the date hereof, and (b) the closing date of any company takeover proposal (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) plus 30 days, or (iii) the payment by the issuer and the receipt by gemstar of the company termination fee. if a purchase event occurs, sub will have the right, upon five business days' prior written notice to the issuer (or any successor in interest to the issuer by merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or otherwise) (the "put notice"), to cause the issuer (or any successor in interest to the issuer by merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or otherwise) to have a closing (as such term is defined in the company option agreement) and to pay at such closing (and the issuer and such successor, jointly and severally, will be obligated to pay to sub in consideration for the cancellation of the stock option) an aggregate cancellation price (the "cancellation price") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of common stock as to which the stock option remains exercisable multiplied by (y) the excess of (i) the average per share closing price of shares of common stock as quoted on nasdaq national market system (or if not then quoted thereon, on such other quotation system or exchange on which the common stock is quoted) for the period of five trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the occurrence of the put notice over (ii) the purchase price (as such term is defined in the company option agreement). under the terms of the shareholder agreement, the shareholders have agreed to vote or cause to be voted all shares of common stock of the issuer owned of record or beneficially owned or held in any capacity by any of them or under any of their control (the "shares") in favor of the merger and other transactions provided for in or contemplated by the merger agreement and against any inconsistent proposals or transactions. further, during the period from the date of the merger agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement pursuant to its terms or the effective time of the merger, the shareholders have agreed to not sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of the shares or any interest therein or agree to sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of the shares or any interest therein, without gemstar's express written consent. other than as described above, gemstar has no plans or proposals which relate to, or may result in, any of the matters listed in items 4(a)-(j) of schedule 13d (although gemstar reserves the right to do so). the descriptions herein of the merger agreement, the company option agreement and the shareholder agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as exhibits. 6 page 6 of 136 item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. 1. company option agreement. 2. agreement and plan of merger. 3. company

ex-1 2 company option agreement 1 exhibit 1 company option agreement this company option agreement (this "agreement") is entered into as of december 23, 1996, by and between starsight telecast, inc., a california corporation ("issuer"), and gemstar international group limited, a british virgin islands corporation ("grantee"). background a. issuer, grantee and a wholly-owned subsidiary of grantee (the "purchaser"), are entering into an agreement and plan of merger of even date herewith (the "merger agreement") providing for, among other things, the merger of purchaser with and into issuer. b. to induce grantee and purchaser to enter into the merger agreement, issuer has agreed to grant this option to grantee. agreement in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, issuer and grantee hereby agree as follows: 1. grant of option. subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, issuer hereby grants to grantee an irrevocable option (the "option") to purchase 5,276,034 shares (the "option shares") of common stock, no par value, of issuer ("issuer common stock") in the manner set forth below at a purchase price of $10.46 per option share (the "purchase price"). 2. exercise of option. 2.1 grantee may exercise the option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time following the occurrence of a purchase event (as defined below) and prior to termination as set forth in section 10.11. 2.2 as used herein, a "purchase event" means any termination of the merger agreement pursuant to section 7.1(h), (j) or (l) thereof. 2.3 if grantee wishes to exercise the option at such time as the option is exercisable, it shall send to issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "notice date") specifying (i) the total number of option shares it intends to purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 15 business days from the notice date for the closing of such purchase (the "closing date"); provided that if the closing of 2 the purchase and sale pursuant to the option (the "closing") cannot be consummated by reason of any applicable judgment, decree, order, law or regulation, the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which such restriction on consummation has expired or been terminated; and provided further, without limiting the foregoing, that if prior notification to or approval of any regulatory authority or shareholders of the issuer is required in connection with such purchase, grantee shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same (and issuer shall cooperate with grantee in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval), and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (a) any required notification period has expired or been terminated or (b) such approval has been obtained, and in either event, any requisite waiting period has passed. 2.4 notwithstanding subsection 2.3, in no event shall any closing date be more than six months after the related notice date, and if the closing date shall not have occurred within six months after the related notice date due to the failure to obtain any such required approval, the exercise of the option effected on the notice date shall be deemed to have expired. in the event (i) grantee receives official notice that an approval of any regulatory authority required for the purchase of option shares would not be issued or granted or (ii) a closing date shall not have occurred within six months after the related notice date due to the failure to obtain any such required approval, grantee shall nevertheless be entitled to exercise its right as set forth in section 7 or to exercise the option in connection with the resale of issuer common stock or other securities pursuant to a registration statement as provided in section 8. the provisions of this section 2 and section 3 shall apply with appropriate adjustments to any such exercise. 3. payment and delivery of certificates. 3.1 on each closing date, grantee shall pay to issuer in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by issuer an amount equal to the purchase price multiplied by the number of option shares to be purchased on such closing date. 3.2 at each closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in subsection 3.1, issuer shall deliver to grantee a certificate or certificates representing the option shares to be purchased at such closing, which option shares shall be free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever, and grantee shall deliver to issuer a letter making the representations set forth in section 5.2 hereinbelow and agreeing that grantee shall 2 3 not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such option shares in violation of applicable law and shall represent and warrant that it and/or its advisors have sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters to evaluate the issuer, to evaluate the risk of an investment in the option shares, to make an informed investment decision with respect thereto, and to protect its interests in connection with its investment in the option shares without need for the additional information which would be required to be included in a more complete registration statement effective under the securities act. the grantee shall further acknowledge and agree that it and/or its advisors have had an opportunity to ask questions of and to receive answers from officers and other representatives of the issuer and to obtain additional information in writing to the extent that the issuer possesses such information or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense; (i) relative to the issuer and the option shares; and (ii) necessary to verify the accuracy of any information, documents, projections, and books and records furnished. 3.3 certificates for the option shares delivered at each closing shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend which shall read substantially as follows: "the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under either (i) the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act") or (ii) any applicable state law governing the offer and sale of securities. no transfer or other disposition of these shares, or of any interest therein, may be made except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the act and such other state laws or pursuant to exemptions from registration under the act, such other state laws, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder." it is understood and agreed that the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend if grantee shall have delivered to issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the sec, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to issuer and its counsel, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act. 4. representations and warranties of issuer. except as set forth in the company disclosure letter (as defined in the merger agreement), issuer hereby represents and warrants to grantee as follows: 4.1 due authorization. issuer has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. the execution and delivery of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all 3 4 necessary corporate action on the part of issuer. this agreement has been duly executed and delivered by issuer and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of issuer, enforceable against issuer in accordance with its terms. 4.2 authorized stock. issuer has taken all necessary corporate and other action to authorize and reserve for issuance, upon exercise of the option, shares of issuer common stock necessary for grantee to exercise the option, and issuer will take all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve for issuance all additional shares of issuer common stock or other securities which may be issued pursuant to section 6 upon exercise of the option. the shares of issuer common stock to be issued upon due exercise of the option, including all additional shares of issuer common stock or other securities which may be issuable pursuant to section 6 upon issuance pursuant hereto, shall be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and shall be delivered free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever, including any preemptive rights of any shareholder of issuer. 4.3 no conflicts. the execution and delivery of this agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with or violate any provision of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of issuer or any material agreement or obligation of issuer. 5. representations and warranties of grantee. grantee hereby represents and warrants to issuer that: 5.1 due authorization. grantee has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. the execution and delivery of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of grantee. this agreement has been duly executed and delivered by grantee and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of grantee, enforceable against grantee in accordance with its terms. 5.2 purchase not for distribution. any option shares or other securities acquired by grantee upon exercise of the option will be acquired for investment and not with a view to the public distribution thereof and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in a transaction registered or exempt from registration under the securities act. 6. adjustment upon changes in capitalization, etc. 6.1 in the event of any change in issuer common stock by reason of a stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the option shall be 4 5 adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that grantee shall receive upon exercise of the option and payment of the aggregate purchase price hereunder the number and class of shares or other securities or property that grantee would have received in respect of issuer common stock if the option had been exercised in full immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable. whenever the number of shares of issuer common stock purchasable upon exercise of the option is adjusted as provided in this section 6, the purchase price shall be adjusted by multiplying the purchase price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of issuer common stock purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of issuer common stock purchasable after the adjustment. 6.2 (a) in the event that issuer shall enter into an agreement (other than the merger agreement) (a) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than purchaser or one of its subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (b) to permit any person other than purchaser or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into issuer and issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of issuer common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of issuer or any other person or cash or any other property or then outstanding shares of issuer common stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the surviving corporation or (c) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than purchaser or one of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction so that purchaser shall receive upon exercise of the option the number and class of shares or other securities or property that purchaser

5.9 initial press release exhibit 5.9-1 95 exhibit 5.10(a) form of the company affiliate letter gemstar international group limited 135 north los robles avenue, suite 800 pasadena, california 91101 ladies and gentlemen: i have been advised that as of the date of this letter i may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of starsight telecast, inc., a california corporation (the "company"), as the term "affiliate" is (i) defined within the meaning of rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "rules and regulations") of the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), and/or (ii) used in and for purposes of accounting series releases 130 and 135, as amended, of the commission. pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger dated as of december 23, 1996 (the "agreement"), among gemstar international group limited, a british virgin islands corporation ("parent"), g/s acquisition subsidiary, a california corporation ("sub"), and the company, sub will be merged with and into the company (the "merger"). in connection with the merger, i am entitled to receive ordinary shares, par value $.01 per share, of parent (the "parent shares") in exchange for shares (or options or warrants for shares) owned by me of capital stock of the company (the "company shares"). i represent, warrant and covenant to parent that in the event i receive any parent shares as a result of the merger: (a) i shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the parent shares in violation of the act or the rules and regulations. (b) i have carefully read this letter and the agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of parent shares, to the extent i felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the company. (c) i have been advised that the issuance of parent shares to me pursuant to the merger will be registered with the commission under the act on a registration statement on form f-4. however, because i have been advised that, at the time the merger is submitted for a vote of the shareholders of the company (a) i may be deemed to be an affiliate of the company and (b) other than as set forth in the agreement, the distribution by me of the parent shares has not been registered under the act, i will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of parent shares issued to me in the merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition exhibit 5.10(a)-1 96 is effected in compliance with the applicable requirements of rule 145 promulgated by the commission under the act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to parent or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the staff of the commission, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the act. (d) i understand that parent, except as provided by contractual arrangement existing on the date hereof, is under no obligation, to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the parent shares by me or on my behalf under the act or, except as set forth in the following paragraph, to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available solely as a result of the merger. from and after the effective time of the merger and for so long as is necessary in order to permit me to sell the parent shares held by me pursuant to rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, rule 144 under the securities act, parent will file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, as the same shall be in effect at the time, referred to in paragraph (c) of rule 144 under the securities act, in order to permit me to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the parent shares held by me pursuant to the terms and conditions of rule 145 and the applicable provisions of rule 144. (e) i also understand that there will be placed on the certificates for the parent shares issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: the shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which rule 145 promulgated under the securities act of 1933 applies. the shares represented by this certificate may only be transferred in accordance with the terms of an agreement dated december 23, 1996 between the registered holder hereof and gemstar international group limited a copy of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of gemstar international group limited. (f) i also understand that unless a sale or transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of rule 145 or rule 144, or pursuant to a registration statement, parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: exhibit 5.10(a)-2 97 the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which rule 145 promulgated under the securities act of 1933 applies. the shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the securities act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. it is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to parent a copy of a letter from the staff of the commission, or an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to parent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to parent, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the act. in connection with the proposed merger, i wish to inform you that i do not have any present commitment, plan or intention to sell (or engage in a risk-reducing or other arrangement which would be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes), transfer or otherwise dispose of any of my company shares prior to and in contemplation of the merger or any of the parent shares i will receive in the merger. i further agree that i will not offer to sell, sell or otherwise dispose of any of the parent shares in violation of the act or offer to sell, sell or otherwise dispose of any of my company shares (other than through conversion to parent's shares in the merger) or any of the parent shares received by me in the merger until such time as financial results covering at least 30 days of post-merger combined operations have been published, whether by issuance of a quarterly earnings report on form 10-q or form 6-k, or other applicable form, or other public issuance (such as a press release) which includes such information. notwithstanding the forgoing, i understand that i will not be prohibited from selling up to 10% of the shares i hold at the time of the merger during the aforementioned period if the requirements of rule 145 are complied with. if the merger agreement were to be terminated prior to the effective time in accordance with its terms, this letter agreement and my obligations hereunder will also terminate concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement. execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part that i am an "affiliate" of the company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any rights i may have to object to any claim that i am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter. exhibit 5.10(a)-3 98 very truly yours,
