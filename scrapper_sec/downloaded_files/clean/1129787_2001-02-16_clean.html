provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration pursuant to this section 1.5: (i) if form s-3 is not available for such offering by the holders; (ii) if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the president or chief executive officer of the company stating that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be seriously detrimental to the company and its stockholders for such form s-3 registration to be effected at such time, in which event the company shall have the right to defer the filing of the form s-3 registration statement for an aggregate of not more than 90 days after receipt of the request of the holders; provided, however, that the company may not utilize this right or the similar right set forth in section 1.2(c) more than once in any twelve- month period; or (iii) in any particular jurisdiction in which the company would be required to qualify to do business or to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, unless the company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the securities act or applicable rules or regulations thereunder. a registration under this section 1.5 shall not constitute a registration under section 1.2 nor shall a registration statement under section 1.2 constitute a registration under this section 1.5. 1.6. obligations of the company. whenever required to effect the -------------------------- registration of any registrable securities under this agreement, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and keep such registration statement effective until the distribution is completed, but not more than 180 days, provided that such 180-day period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the holder refrains from selling any registrable securities included in such registration statement due to circumstances described in section 1.6(f).

provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs (a) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished in writing and expressly stated for use in connection with such registration by such holder, partner, member, officer, director, underwriter or controlling person of such holder or (b) as a result of such holder, partner, member, officer or director, underwriter or controlling person failing to deliver a copy of the prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), if required by law to so deliver, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities, and if the prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the company with section 1.6(c) hereof. (b) by selling holders. to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will, severally and not jointly, if registrable securities held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration is being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter (as defined in the securities act) and any other holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other holder's partners, members, directors or officers or any person who controls such underwriter or other holder within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other such holder, or a member, partner, director, officer or controlling person of such underwriter or other holder may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act, any federal or state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the exchange act or any federal or state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder by an instrument duly executed by such holder and stated to be specifically for use in such registration; and each such holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other holder, partner, member, officer, director or controlling person of such other holder or underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided further, that the total amounts payable in indemnity by a holder under this section 1.8(b) in respect of any violation shall not exceed the net proceeds received by such holder in the registered offering out of which such violation arises. (c) notice. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 1.8, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if the defendants include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 1.8, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under section 1.8. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 1.8 is unavailable to a party entitled to indemnification, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the indemnified party as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action; provided, -------- however, that, in any such case, (1) no holder shall be required to contribute - ------- any amount in excess of the public offering price of all registrable securities offered and sold by such holder pursuant to such registration statement; and (2) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) survival. the obligations of the company and holders under this section 1.8 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement. 1.9. rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available the benefits ------------------ of certain rules and regulations of the sec which may at any time permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, after such time as a public market exists for the common stock, the company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act, at all times after the effective date of the first registration under the securities act filed by the company for an offering of its securities to the general public; (b) file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act (at any time after it has become subject to such

reporting requirements of rule 144 (at any time after 90 days after the effective date of the first registration statement filed by the company for an offering of its securities to the general public), and of the securities act and the exchange act (at any time after it has become subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act), a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents of the company as a holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the sec allowing a holder to sell any such
