(a)-(c), (j) the offer will be made pursuant to the merger agreement. the merger agreement provides, among other things, that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein, as soon as practicable after the consummation of the offer, purchaser will be merged with and into the company (the "merger"), with the company being the corporation surviving the merger (the "surviving corporation"). at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), each outstanding share (other than shares held in the company's treasury immediately before the effective time, and each share held by parent, purchaser, any other subsidiary of parent or any subsidiary of the company immediately before the effective time, all of which will be cancelled, and other than shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised under the delaware general corporation law) will be converted into and represent the right to receive $21.00 in cash, subject to any applicable withholding taxes, without interest. (d) the merger agreement provides that promptly following the purchase of and payment for a number of shares which represents not less than fifty-one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares on a fully-diluted basis (excluding any shares held by the company or any of its subsidiaries) (the "minimum condition"), and from time to time thereafter, purchaser shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the (page 5 of 14 pages) next whole number, on the board of directors of the company (the "board") that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors by purchaser) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares beneficially owned by parent and purchaser (including shares paid for pursuant to the offer), upon such acceptance for payment, bears to the total number of shares outstanding, and the company shall take all action within its power to cause purchaser's designees to be elected or appointed to the board, including, without limitation, increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. at such time, the company will also use its best efforts to cause individual directors designated by purchaser to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the board other than any committee established to take action under the merger agreement and (ii) each board of directors of each subsidiary of the company, and each committee thereof, that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the board. notwithstanding the foregoing, until the effective time the board must have at least two directors who are directors on the date of the merger agreement and who are not officers of the company. the company's obligations to appoint purchaser's designees to the board is subject to section 14(f) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act") and rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. after the effective time, the directors of purchaser will be the initial directors of the surviving corporation, and the officers of the company will be the initial officers of the surviving corporation. (e) in the merger agreement, the company has agreed to certain limitations on its ability to declare, set aside, make or pay any dividends or other distributions in respect of any of its capital stock during the period between execution of the merger agreement and the effective time.

(g) in connection with the offer and the merger, the board has approved an amendment to the rights agreement to assure that the rights are not exercisable as a result of the offer or the merger. (h)-(i) the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of holders of shares and the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly. the shares are currently listed and traded on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse"), which constitutes the principal trading market for the shares. depending upon the aggregate market value and the number of shares not purchased pursuant to the offer, the shares may no longer meet the standards for continued listing on the nyse. the shares are currently registered under the exchange act. such registration may be terminated upon application of the company to the securities and exchange commission ("sec") if such shares are not listed on a national securities exchange and there are fewer than 300 holders of record of the shares. if the shares were no longer registered under the exchange (page 6 of 14 pages) act, the shares would no longer be eligible for nyse reporting. parent and purchaser intend to cause the company to make an application for termination of registration of the shares as soon as possible after consummation of the offer if the shares are then eligible for such termination. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.
