it being understood that withholding consent will not be unreasonable if patriot determines the transfer or pledge may eliminate or reduce the certainty or likelihood of the proxy shares being voted as contemplated by the proxy agreement. no transfer or pledge may be made unless the transferee or pledgee enters into a written agreement under which it agrees to be bound by all the terms of the proxy agreement. the proxy agreement further provides that each wyndham stockholder that is a party thereto irrevocably constitutes and appoints patriot, or any nominee of patriot, with full power of substitution, during and for the proxy term, as such wyndham stockholder's true and lawful attorney and proxy to vote each of the proxy shares (a) in favor of the adoption of the patriot merger agreement and approval of the patriot merger and the other transactions contemplated by the patriot merger agreement, (b) against any "acquisition proposal" (as that term is defined in the patriot merger agreement), any change in the directors of the company or other material changes in the company's corporate structure or business and (c) in favor of any other matter necessary for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the patriot merger agreement. under the terms of the proxy agreement, each wyndham stockholder agrees that during the proxy term it will not, nor permit any of its affiliates (other than the company, to the extent permitted by the merger agreement), to (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of, any inquiries, proposals or other offers from any person relating to an "acquisition proposal," (b) enter into any agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal or (c) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish information with respect to any inquiries or the making of any proposals that constitute, or would reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal. the proxy agreement also provides that nothing therein shall prevent any wyndham stockholder or its representatives or designees who are serving on the board of directors of the company, or who are officers of the company, from taking any action, subject to the applicable provisions of the patriot merger agreement, while acting in such capacity as a director or officer of the company. revocable proxy simultaneous with the execution of the proxy agreement, mr. crow executed a revocable proxy with respect to the 100 shares of common stock of the company directly held by him, pursuant to which he granted to patriot a proxy with full power of substitution to vote such shares of stock on terms similar to those in the proxy granted by the wyndham stockholders to patriot in the proxy agreement. page 13 of 26 pages 14 the foregoing descriptions of the proxy agreement and revocable proxy are qualified in their entirety by reference to the forms of such documents that are attached hereto as exhibits and incorporated herein by reference. patriot merger as a result of the patriot merger, new patriot reit will acquire all of the assets of the company, including the company's portfolio of 23 owned and leased hotels, with an aggregate of 4,877 rooms, as well as management and/or franchise agreements associated with the company's 79 managed and franchised properties throughout north america, and the wyndham, wyndham garden and wyndham hotels & resorts proprietary brand names. pursuant to the "patriot merger agreement" (as hereinafter used, this term shall be deemed to collectively refer to the agreement and plan of merger and the stock purchase agreement), each outstanding share of common stock of the company will be converted into the right to receive 0.712 shares (the "patriot exchange ratio") of common stock of each of new patriot reit and patriot american hospitality operating company ("new patriot operating company," known as bay meadows operating company prior to the cal-jockey merger), which shares will be paired and transferable and trade together as a single unit following the cal-jockey merger (the "paired shares"). the patriot exchange ratio is subject to adjustment in the event that the average of the closing prices of the paired shares on the twenty trading days preceding the fifth trading day prior to the wyndham stockholders' meeting called to approve the patriot merger (the "average trading price") is less than $42.13 per paired share. if the average trading price is between $40.21 and $42.13 per paired share, the patriot exchange ratio will be adjusted so that each outstanding share of common stock of the company will be converted into the right to receive a number of paired shares equal to $30.00 divided by the average trading price. if the average trading price is less than $40.21 per paired share, there will be no further adjustments to the patriot exchange ratio, which at that point would equate to 0.746 paired shares per share of common stock of the company; however, in such circumstances, the company has the right, waivable by it, to terminate the patriot merger agreement without liability. in lieu of receiving paired shares, stockholders of the company (including cfs) have the right to elect to receive cash in an amount per share equal to the patriot exchange ratio (as it may be adjusted) multiplied by the average of the closing prices of the paired shares on the five trading days immediately preceding the closing of the patriot merger, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $100 million. if stockholders holding shares of common stock of the company with a value in excess of this amount elect to receive cash, such cash will be allocated on a pro rata basis among such stockholders. in connection with the patriot merger, new patriot reit will assume the company's existing indebtedness, which is approximately $138 million as of april 14, 1997. in connection with the execution of the patriot merger agreement, patriot also entered into agreements with partnerships affiliated with members of the trammell crow family providing for the acquisition by new patriot reit of 11 full-service page 14 of 26 pages 15 wyndham-branded hotels with 3,072 rooms, located throughout the united states, for approximately $331.7 million in cash, plus approximately $14 million in additional consideration if two hotels meet certain operational targets (the "crow acquisition" and, collectively with the patriot merger, the "proposed patriot transactions"). the patriot merger and the crow acquisition, which will be consummated concurrently, are subject to various conditions including, without limitation, the consummation of the cal-jockey merger and the transactions related thereto and the approval of the patriot merger and certain of the related transactions by the stockholders of new patriot reit, new patriot operating company and the company. it is currently anticipated that the stockholder meetings to approve the proposed patriot transactions will occur in the fourth quarter of 1997. in connection with the consummation of the proposed patriot transactions, certain changes will be made with respect to the officers and members of the boards of directors of new patriot reit and new patriot operating company. james d. carreker, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, will serve as chairman and chief executive officer of new patriot operating company. paul a. nussbaum will remain chairman and chief executive officer of new patriot reit and william w. evans iii, who currently serves in patriot's office of the chairman, will become president of new patriot reit replacing tom lattin, who will become executive vice president -- property management for new patriot operating company. rex e. stewart, who currently serves as patriot's chief financial officer, will serve as chief financial officer of new patriot operating company and anne l. raymond, currently the chief financial officer of the company, will serve as chief financial officer of new patriot reit. it is also anticipated that the board of directors of new patriot reit and new patriot operating company will be reconstituted in connection with the consummation of the proposed patriot transactions so that each board of directors will consist of 11 members, including (i) two designees of the company and one designee of the trammell crow family to the new patriot reit board of directors and (ii) three designees of the company and one designee of the trammell crow family to the new patriot operating company. it is currently anticipated that harlan crow will serve as the trammell crow family's representative on the new patriot reit board of directors. the remaining members for each board of directors will be selected by new patriot reit and will include members of patriot's existing board of directors, as well as additional persons to be selected prior to the patriot merger. paul a. nussbaum and james d. carreker (who will be one of the wyndham designees) will serve as directors of both new patriot reit and new patriot operating company. the descriptions herein of the patriot merger agreement and the stock purchase agreement are qualified in their entirety to the forms of such agreements that are attached hereto as exhibits and are incorporated herein by reference. the joint press release of patriot and the company dated april 14, 1997 describing in greater detail the terms of the patriot merger is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. page 15 of 26 pages 16 item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.

(c) not applicable. (d) pursuant to the pledge described in item 3(e), the company has the right to require the application of proceeds of sales of pledged shares of common stock to the balance of the promissory note described therein. in september 1996, messrs. carreker, bentley and koonce entered into certain margin loan transactions ("margin loans") with smith barney, inc. (the "lender") for personal loans in which shares of common stock (the "pledged shares") held by such persons were pledged as collateral for the margin loans. in the event of a default under a margin loan and a subsequent foreclosure sale of the pledged shares, the lender would be entitled to receive proceeds from such sale to the extent required to satisfy the obligations owed to it under the related margin loan. as a condition to the margin loans, the company entered into a registration rights agreement with the lender, which provides that the lender and its affiliates may require the company upon written notice to register the pledged shares for sale at any time following (i) the date on which the closing price of the company's common stock, as reported on the new york stock exchange or other exchange or public market on which the common stock is traded, is less than $14.00 per share; or (ii) the borrowers' failure to promptly meet a margin call.

(the "bedrock stockholders"), and cfs, mr. crow, ms. susan t. groenteman, mr. carreker, mr. bentley, ms. raymond, mr. koonce, mr. eric a. danziger (formerly a senior executive officer of the company) and wel (collectively, the "crow/wyndham stockholders"), which imposes certain restrictions on the transfer of common stock held by such stockholders (the "stockholders") and entitles the stockholders to certain rights regarding corporate governance. pursuant to the stockholders' agreement, each of the stockholders agrees not to sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of ("transfer") its common stock otherwise than as permitted by the provisions of the stockholders' agreement. the stockholders' agreement permits the following transfers: (i) open-market sales not exceeding the volume limitations imposed by rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended, (ii) sales in the company's initial public offering and (iii) transfers of common stock by wel to the direct or indirect owners of equity interests in wel. the stockholders' agreement also provides that any stockholders may transfer any common stock, provided that the transferee agrees to be bound by the stockholders' agreement (a) to any wholly-owned affiliate of the transferring stockholder, (b) to certain transferring stockholder family members, trusts or, if the transferring stockholder is a corporation, partnership or other entity, its equity owners, (c) to certain members of the trammell crow family or their lineal descendants (together with any entity not less than 75% of the beneficial interests of which are owned by such members of the trammell crow family, the "crow interests"), (d) to the company or to any then-existing crow/wyndham stockholder or to any full time senior executive officer of the company, (e) as a pledge to secure indebtedness, provided that the pledgee agrees to offer a right of purchase, in the event of any foreclosure of the pledge, to the other stockholders in accordance with the stockholders' agreement, and (f) to the owners of equity interests in a stockholder upon a partial or complete liquidation or dissolution of such stockholder. the stockholders' agreement further provides that except with respect to a permitted transfer described above, the proposed transfer by a stockholder to a third party of common stock shall be subject to a first right of purchase in favor of the stockholders in the other stockholder group (as defined below) at the price and on the other terms of the proposed third-party sale. the company has a prior right to purchase common stock subject to a proposed transfer if the offered common stock represents all of the common stock held by the crow interests, but only to the extent the purchase by the bedrock stockholders of the common stock would cause the bedrock stockholders to own more page 17 of 26 pages 18 than 40% of the outstanding common stock. the company has waived such right in connection with the transfer contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. a similar first right of purchase requirement applies in the event of third-party sales in connection with a shelf registration or an underwritten public offering in which stockholders propose to sell common stock. under the stockholders' agreement, the bedrock stockholders and the crow/wyndham stockholders (each a "stockholder group") are each entitled to nominate a portion of the company's board of directors, such portion to be based upon the proportionate number of shares of common stock held by each stockholder group and to be allocated as proportionately as practicable between independent directors and other directors. each stockholder group is also entitled to nominate directors to serve on each of the board's committees on a similar proportionate basis. subject to certain conditions set forth in the stockholders' agreement, each stockholder group agrees to use its best efforts to elect the director nominated in accordance with the stockholders' agreement and to remove directors under certain circumstances. the stockholders' agreement further provides that as long as the crow interests own at least 30% of the outstanding common stock (excluding any shares acquired from a third party after the date of the stockholders' agreement), the chairman of the board of the company shall be a person designated by the crow interests. in the event the bedrock stockholders own at least 30% of the outstanding common stock (excluding any shares acquired from a third party after the date of the stockholders' agreement) and the crow interests no longer own at least such percentage, the chairman of the board of the company shall be a person designated by the bedrock stockholders. the stockholders' agreement terminates upon the earliest to occur of (a) the sixth anniversary of the date of the stockholders' agreement, (b) the bedrock stockholders and the crow/wyndham stockholders collectively owning less than 37.5% of the outstanding common stock, (c) the termination of management contracts in connection with the development fund organized by the bedrock stockholders and certain lenders, below a specified level, (d) certain changes in control of the bedrock stockholders, (e) the bedrock stockholders owning less than 50% of the number of shares of common stock held by them immediately following the company's initial public offering and (f) any distribution of common stock by the bedrock stockholders to direct or indirect owners of equity interest in the bedrock stockholders that result in such common stock being held by anyone other than a bedrock principal or an entity controlled by such a principal. the parties to the proxy agreement have agreed that to the extent of any conflict between the proxy agreement and the stockholders' agreement, the proxy statement shall control. page 18 of 26 pages 19 registration rights agreement on may 24, 1996, the company entered into a registration rights agreement with cfs, mr. crow, ms. susan t. groenteman, mr. carreker, mr. bentley, ms. raymond, mr. koonce, mr. eric a. danziger, wel and the bedrock stockholders (the "registration rights agreement") pursuant to which the company agreed, subject to certain limitations and under certain circumstances, to register for sale any shares of common stock (and other securities of the company that are exercisable to purchase, convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the company) that are held by the parties thereto (collectively, the "registrable securities"). all of the shares of common stock held by filing persons are registrable securities. the registration rights agreement provides that any holder of registrable securities may require the company upon written notice to register for sale such registrable securities (a "demand registration"), provided that the total amount of registrable securities to be included in the demand registration has a market value of at least $20 million and provided that notice is not given prior to six months after the effective date of the previous demand registration. subject to the foregoing, the holders of registrable securities may request an unlimited number of demand registrations. the registration rights agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, in the event the company proposes to file a registration statement with respect to an offering of any class of equity securities, other than certain types of registrations, the company will offer the holders of registrable securities the opportunity to register the number of registrable securities they request to include (the "piggyback registration"). the company is generally required to pay all of the expenses of demand registrations and piggyback registrations, other than underwriting discounts and commissions. in the event of a demand registration within one year of the date of the registration rights agreement, the holders of the registrable securities being registered must pay up to $250,000 ($125,000 in the case of a shelf registration) of such expenses. promissory notes - see item 3(e)

provided, however, that the shares of unpaired preferred stock to be issued as unpaired share consideration pursuant to the foregoing shall be reduced to the extent that the issuance of such stock causes any rent derived or received by purchaser or its affiliates to fail to qualify as "rents from real property" by reason of section 856(d)(2)(b) of the code or causes the purchaser to be "closely held" within the meaning of section 856(a)(6) of the code (such limitations set forth in this proviso being referred to herein as the "unpaired ownership limitations"). to the extent that the number of shares of unpaired preferred stock to be issued as unpaired share consideration is reduced pursuant to the unpaired ownership limitations, stockholder shall receive cash in lieu of unpaired share consideration, with a share of unpaired preferred stock being valued for such purpose at a value equal to the "fair market value" (determined in accordance with section 5.3(a) of the merger agreement) of a paired share of purchaser stock and operating company stock. purchaser shall reasonably determine, after taking into account the results of the investigation described in section 2.3 3 4 hereof and such other facts and circumstances known to purchaser as are relevant to such determination, the effect, if any, of the paired ownership limitations and the unpaired ownership limitations on the relative amounts of the types of consideration to be paid hereunder, but such limitations shall not decrease or increase the total amount of the consideration payable hereunder; provided, however, that if the product of the number of paired shares of purchaser stock and operating company stock constituting the paired share consideration multiplied by the "fair market value" (determined in accordance with section 5.3(a) of the merger agreement) of a paired share of purchaser stock and operating company stock is less than fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), then stockholder may terminate this agreement at or prior to the closing. the unpaired preferred stock shall have the provisions described on exhibit a hereto, unless purchaser and stockholder otherwise agree.

(nyse:pah) and wyndham hotel corporation (nyse:wyn) jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement providing for patriot's acquisition of wyndham. under terms of the merger agreement, patriot will acquire all of the assets of wyndham, including wyndham's portfolio of 23 owned or leased hotels, with an aggregate of 4,877 rooms, management and franchise agreements associated with wyndham's 79 managed and franchised properties throughout north america and the wyndham(sm), wyndham garden(r) and wyndham hotels & resorts(sm) proprietary brand names for approximately $763 million (based on patriot's closing share price as of april 11, 1997), including approximately $611 million in patriot stock (up to $100 million of which may be replaced with cash, at the option of wyndham shareholders) and $152 million in assumption or retirement of debt. in addition, patriot american announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement with partnerships affiliated with members of the trammell crow family providing for the acquisition by patriot of 11 full-service wyndham-branded hotels with 3,072 rooms, located throughout the united states for approximately $330 million in cash, plus approximately $14 million in additional consideration subject to two of the hotels meeting certain operational targets. patriot expects that the acquisition of wyndham and the purchase of the wyndham branded hotels from the crow family partnerships, transactions which together are valued at approximately $1.1 billion, will be completed concurrently early in the fourth quarter of 1997. "the acquisition of wyndham culminates patriot's evolution from a hotel reit into a nationally branded, fully integrated hotel company," said paul a. nussbaum, chairman and chief executive officer of patriot american. "in wyndham, we will acquire an exceptional -7- 3 hotel management organization, along with a respected and rapidly growing hotel brand. in acquiring wyndham, we also maximize the benefits arising from our acquisition of the paired share ownership structure and take another significant step towards becoming a world-class hotel company." "the merger of patriot american and wyndham is a tremendous strategic fit, combining wyndham's hotel management, franchise and development businesses, with patriot's proven hotel acquisition and asset management expertise," said james d. carreker, chairman, chief executive officer and president of wyndham. "this combination will create a powerful new force in the hospitality industry, with numerous avenues for growth. in joining with patriot, we enhance our ability to grow the wyndham brand both nationally and internationally. likewise, patriot gains the benefit of an experienced hotel management organization as it continues to aggressively pursue its hotel acquisition strategy." the first nationally branded and fully integrated hotel company with the tax- advantaged "paired share" ownership structure as a result of its previously announced merger with california jockey club and bay meadows operating company (amex:cj), which is scheduled to close on or before june 30, patriot american will become one of only four public companies, and one of only two hotel reits, to enjoy the benefits of the unique "paired share" ownership structure. through this structure, patriot's stock will be paired with an operating company and traded as a single unit. patriot will be able to own hotels and lease them to the paired operating company, while retaining the benefits of reit tax status. following the wyndham acquisition, patriot will be the first paired-share reit to integrate hotel acquisition, ownership, management, construction and development capabilities, along with the marketing power of a nationally-recognized hotel brand, within this uniquely efficient corporate structure. "the acquisition of wyndham capitalizes on the power of the paired share ownership structure," said nussbaum. "following the wyndham acquisition, our paired operating company will gain the knowledge and experience of the wyndham organization, one of the most dynamic and successful management companies in the hospitality industry. we will also gain ownership of the wyndham brand, which has become synonymous with high quality and superior customer service in the upscale segment of the lodging industry. and we will accomplish all of this while retaining the tax benefits of patriot's reit status." nussbaum said that, from a financial perspective, patriot expects the acquisitions announced today to be accretive to patriot's funds from operations (ffo) per share upon completion, and to contribute significantly to ffo per share growth in 1998 and future years. upon completion of the cal jockey/bay meadows and wyndham transactions, patriot intends to rename its paired operating company as "wyndham international," the paired -8- 4 shares of patriot american hospitality and wyndham international will trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol" "pah." the merger agreement under terms of the merger agreement, wyndham will merge with and into patriot, with patriot being the surviving corporation. each share of wyndham will be converted into the right to receive 0.712 paired shares of patriot, subject to adjustment as described below. the 0.712 exchange ratio reflects patriot's acquisition of cal jockey/bay meadows, which will be completed prior to the wyndham merger and which, for tax reasons, will involve the merger of patriot with and into cal jockey. on a pre-cal jockey merger basis, the exchange ratio equates to 1.372 patriot shares for each outstanding wyndham share. based on patriot's april 11, 1997 closing share price of $22.25, the exchange ratio reflects a market value of $30.53 for each wyndham share. the exchange ratio is subject to adjustment in the event that patriot's average share price for the twenty trading days preceding the fifth trading day prior to the shareholders' meetings called to approve the merger drops below a specified price (the equivalent of approximately $21.86 on a pre-cal jockey merger basis). between this figure and another specified price (the equivalent of approximately $20.87 on a pre-cal jockey merger basis), the exchange ratio will be adjusted to provide wyndham shareholders with patriot shares having a value of $30.00 based on the average patriot price. below the lower figure, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.746 (which equates to approximately 1.438 patriot shares on a pre-cal/jockey merger basis), although wyndham will have the ability to terminate the merger agreement without liability to patriot. in order to maintain patriot's status as a reit and satisfy certain tax issues, the shareholders of wyndham will have the option to receive cash for a portion of their shares in wyndham, up to a maximum of $100 million (or approximately 16% of the total consideration payable to wyndham shareholders in the merger). the cash will be apportioned on a pro rata basis among all wyndham shareholders who elect to receive cash for a portion of their shares. cash consideration per share will equal the market value (based on a trailing average) of the paired shares otherwise issuable in exchange for outstanding wyndham shares. the merger is expected to be tax-free to shareholders of wyndham with respect to the reit portion of the paired shares received by such shareholders. the paired operating company portion (which is expected to represent 5% to 10% of the total consideration) of the paired shares, as well as any cash received by wyndham shareholders in lieu of paired shares, will generally be taxable to the shareholders of wyndham. -9- 5 a fully integrated management organization following the acquisition of wyndham, paul nussbaum will continue to serve as chairman and chief executive officer of patriot, with responsibility for all of patriot's activities, including acquisitions, asset management, financing and strategic planning. william w. evans iii, who currently serves in patriot's office of the chairman, will assume the position of president of patriot and will be appointed to patriot's board. anne l. raymond, currently chief financial officer of wyndham, will serve as chief financial officer of patriot following the merger. following the merger, james d. carreker, wyndham's chairman, chief executive officer and president, will serve as chairman and chief executive officer of patriot's paired operating company, wyndham international. tom w. lattin, who currently serves as patriot's president, will assume a senior position at wyndham international, as executive vice president overseeing the continuing development of the wyndham brand name through third-party management and franchising. rex e. stewart, who currently serves as chief financial officer of patriot, will serve as chief financial officer of wyndham international. wyndham international will include the carefree resorts organization, for management of the carefree resorts portfolio acquired by patriot in january, and an historic hotels division, for management of the grand heritage hotel portfolio and other historic or landmark hotel properties. both the carefree resorts organization and the historic hotels division will report to mr. carreker. "the senior executive teams of patriot and wyndham complement each other very well," said nussbaum. "as a result of the merger, as well as our acquisition of carefree resorts in january and our planned acquisition of grand heritage hotels, we will have one of the deepest and most experienced management organizations in the lodging industry, with expertise in all phases of the business, from acquisitions to brand management, from operations to construction and development." "on a personal level, jim carreker and i have known each other for many years," said nussbaum. "we worked together closely last year to develop a lessee relationship between patriot and wyndham. i am particularly pleased that jim will serve as chairman and chief executive officer of the paired operating company and that members of the wyndham management team will be integrated throughout our combined organization. the paired operating company, as well as patriot as a whole, will benefit from jim's leadership and the skills of the team he has developed at wyndham." patriot also announced that, following the merger with wyndham, the board of directors of patriot and its paired operating company will each consist of 11 members, including three designees of wyndham to the wyndham international board and two designees of wyndham to the patriot board. the crow family will also have the right to designate one member of both boards. it is currently anticipated that harlan crow, managing partner of crow family holdings, will serve as the designee of the crow family -10- 6 to the patriot board. the remaining directors for each board will be selected by patriot and will include members of patriot's existing board as well as additional members to be selected prior to the merger. paul nussbaum, the chairman of patriot, will also serve as a director of the paired operating company. james carreker, the chairman of wyndham international, will also serve on the board of patriot as one of the two wyndham designees. the combined portfolio upon completion of the transactions announced today, as well as the previously announced acquisition of grand heritage hotels, patriot american's hotel portfolio will include 88 owned or leased hotels, aggregating over 20,500 rooms, located in major markets and primary tourist destinations throughout the united states, as well as in canada and the caribbean. additionally, apart from these transactions, patriot american has signed contracts or letters of intent to acquire 19 hotels, aggregating over 4,600 rooms, for an aggregate purchase price (excluding related acquisition costs) of approximately $441 million. assuming completion of these acquisitions, substantially all of which are currently expected to close prior to completion of the wyndham merger, patriot's post-merger portfolio will include 107 owned or leased hotels, with over 25,000 rooms. in addition to the owned portfolio, following the grand heritage acquisition and the wyndham merger, patriot and its paired operating company will manage or franchise 81 hotels (including 14 hotels currently under construction), aggregating over 17,800 rooms, located throughout north america. finally, patriot will own three upscale hotel brands: wyndham, carefree resorts and grand heritage. "the combined company will be well positioned to optimize growth opportunities, both in the acquisition of additional hotels and in the development of wyndham's management and franchise businesses," said nussbaum. "notably, patriot will directly own or lease more than half of the hotels in its portfolio. this creates a solid base from which to grow the management business and continue to build value in our various brands." "from a hotel acquisitions perspective, patriot will have the ability to maximize returns on newly-acquired properties by leasing them to wyndham international," said carreker. "additionally, patriot will have the ability to create value by reflagging existing and subsequently acquired properties utilizing one of our own proprietary brands. this serves to capture for our shareholders the cash flow in management and franchise fees that would otherwise be paid to third parties and, perhaps more importantly, serves to build equity and public awareness in the brands we own." in addition to wyndham, grand heritage and carefree resort properties, patriot's portfolio also includes hotels operating under numerous national and international hotel brands, including marriott, doubletree, hilton, hyatt, holiday inn, four points by sheraton, radisson, embassy suites and westcoast. as part of its continuing hotel acquisition strategy, patriot has established relationships with various hotel management and franchise -11- 7 companies. "we intend to maintain our relationships with other major hotel companies, and to continue to encourage such companies to bring acquisition opportunities to patriot," said nussbaum. "at the same time, we fully intend to maximize the value of our own brands by reflagging properties or by adding the wyndham flag to unbranded hotels within our portfolio." cal jockey/bay meadows merger remains on-track in announcing the merger with wyndham, executives of patriot reiterated patriot's commitment to complete patriot's merger with cal jockey and bay meadows as expeditiously as possible. patriot announced that it will soon file revised proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission for the cal jockey/bay meadows merger. "we are absolutely committed to completing the cal jockey/bay meadows merger," said nussbaum. "we have remained in regular contact with management and the boards of cal jockey and bay meadows and are working closely with them in preparing definitive proxy materials. in this regard, we expect to distribute proxies and convene shareholder meetings to complete the cal jockey/bay meadows merger on or before june 30, 1997." shareholder vote on wyndham merger expected in the fourth quarter the definitive merger agreement between patriot american and wyndham has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both companies and by the special committee of wyndham's board formed to independently review the merger and the merger agreement. in connection with the merger, patriot american has received a fairness opinion from its financial advisor, painewebber incorporated. wyndham has received a fairness opinion with respect to the merger from its financial advisor, smith barney, inc., and the special committee of the wyndham board of directors has received a separate fairness opinion from its financial advisor, merrill lynch and co. the merger agreement is subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies and is also subject to various closing conditions, including the prior completion of cal jockey/bay meadows merger and the concurrent completion of a substantial number of the hotel acquisitions contemplated by patriot's agreement with the crow family partnerships. in the event that wyndham terminates the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including in order to pursue a superior proposal (as defined in the merger agreement), wyndham will be obligated to pay patriot american certain break-up fees, as specified in the merger agreement. if patriot american terminates the merger agreement under certain circumstances, it will be required to pay certain break-up fees to wyndham. patriot american and wyndham have announced that they intend to complete proxy materials as expeditiously as possible following the cal jockey/bay meadows merger and to submit the wyndham merger to shareholder votes early in the fourth quarter. in connection with the signing of the merger agreement, certain significant wyndham shareholders, including

of the merger. these voting agreements are terminable in the event that wyndham terminates the merger agreement under certain circumstances. about wyndham based in dallas, texas, wyndham hotel
