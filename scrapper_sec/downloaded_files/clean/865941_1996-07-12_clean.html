m.m. warburg & co. luxembourg s.a. item 4. purpose of transaction. ---------------------- on july 3, 1996, hanseatic became the beneficial owner, for purposes of rule 13d-3 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), of an additional 548,314 shares of common stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated the date thereof (the "stock purchase agreement") among leonard r. bennett ("bennett") and peter bennett, and, individually and as agent, stephen russell ("russell"), and hanseatic. in connection with closing under the stock purchase agreement, the corporation, russell, bennett and hanseatic amended the stockholders agreement dated october 8, 1992 (as amended, the "stockholders agreement") to release bennett from his obligations thereunder and to provide that, as long as hanseatic or russell owns, or has the right to obtain, five percent of the outstanding shares of common stock, the corporation must use its best efforts to ensure that one member of its board of directors is a designee of hanseatic and one member is a designee of russell. paul a. biddelman, an incumbent member of the corporation's board of directors, is the designee of hanseatic pursuant to such arrangements. in addition, russell and hanseatic have agreed to vote all shares of common stock owned by them in favor of the election of such nominees or, upon the death of russell, for the designee of the holder of a majority of russell's shares of common stock on the date of death, as a director of the corporation. except as aforesaid, hanseatic has acquired all securities of the corporation which it presently owns as an investment in the performance of the corporation, seeking appreciation thereof through the efforts of current management of the corporation. hanseatic intends to continue to review its investment in the corporation and to discuss with management the corporation's strategies, goals and operations, and hanseatic may in the future change its present course of action with a view towards otherwise influencing the strategic goals and operations of the corporation, and may acquire additional shares of common stock. on the other hand, hanseatic may determine to dispose of all or a portion of the common stock which it now owns or may hereafter acquire. in reaching any conclusions as to the foregoing, hanseatic will take into account various factors, including the corporation's business and prospects, general economic conditions and money and stock market conditions. see item 6 herein for information concerning warrants to acquire additional shares of common stock beneficially owned by hanseatic, which information is incorporated by reference to this item. pursuant to rule 13d-4, any statements by traber herein shall not be construed as an admission that traber is, for purposes of section 13(d) of 13(g) of the exchange act, the beneficial owner of any securities of the corporation. traber does not intend to exercise any power to vote or to direct the vote, or to dispose or to direct the disposition of any securities of the corporation that he may be deemed beneficially to own except as determined by management of hanseatic. except as stated in response to this item 4, none of hanseatic, traber, nor biddelman have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any other action specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. ------------------------------------ (a) as of july 12, 1996, hanseatic beneficially owned, for purposes of

best of the knowledge of hanseatic, 12.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. such shares exclude approximately 983,314 shares beneficially owned by russell (including 25,000 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options exercisable within 60 days) subject to the stockholders agreement. traber holds in excess of a majority of the shares of capital stock of hanseatic and, accordingly, may be deemed beneficially to own the shares, constituting, to the best of the knowledge of traber, 12.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. biddelman is the treasurer of hanseatic, and, accordingly, may be deemed beneficially to own the shares in addition to 12,333 shares (the "option shares") of common stock issuable upon exercise of options granted by the corporation under its 1994 employee stock option plan and exercisable within 60 days, in the aggregate constituting, to the best of the knowledge of biddelman, 13.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. (b) excluding any effect of the relationships set forth under the stockholders agreement, hanseatic has sole power to vote or to direct the vote of, and sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of, 995,056 shares of common stock. excluding any effect of the relationships set forth under the stockholders agreement, traber has shared power to vote or to direct the vote of, and shared power to dispose or to direct the disposition of, 995,056 shares of common stock. excluding any effect of the relationships set forth under the stockholders agreement, biddelman has sole power to vote or direct the vote of, and sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of, the option shares, and shared power to vote or to direct the vote of, and shared power to dispose or to direct the disposition of, 995,056 shares of common stock. (c) on july 3, 1996, hanseatic acquired an additional 548,314 shares of common stock pursuant to the privately negotiated stock purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $4,934,826. all of such shares were acquired on behalf of hanseatic americas ldc, a bahamian limited duration company in which the sole managing member is hansabel partners llc, a delaware limited liability company in which hanseatic is the sole managing member.

(e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. ------------------------------------------------------ as more fully described under item 4 herein (which information is incorporated by reference to this item), hanseatic is party to the stockholders agreement. the stockholders' agreement further provides that russell must give hanseatic notice of a proposed sale of any shares of common stock held by him, and that hanseatic has the right to include certain of its own shares of common stock for sale to such prospective purchaser or, alternatively, the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of the shares proposed to be sold by russell, at the same price being offered by the prospective purchaser. in connection with hanseatic's purchase in 1992 of the note, the corporation issued to hanseatic the warrants to purchase, at any time prior to september 30, 1998, 12,121 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.82 per share. pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated october 8, 1992 extended by the corporation to hanseatic, until october 1998 hanseatic and its permitted transferees have the right to require the corporation to file, subject to certain terms and conditions, a registration statement in respect of any or all of the shares of common stock (subject to a minimum of 363,636 shares) covered by such agreement which are then held by the requesting holders. in addition, hanseatic and its permitted transferees have the right to require the corporation to include, subject to certain exceptions, any or all shares of common stock covered by such agreement in any registration statement filed by the corporation. except as stated in response to this item 6, none of hanseatic, traber nor biddelman, nor, to the best of the knowledge of hanseatic, any of the executive officers or directors listed on annex 1, is a party to any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the corporation, including, but not limited to, the transfer or voting of any such securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guaranties or profits, divisions of profit or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7. materials to be filed as

facilitate the sale and to maximize the price to be obtained upon the sale, including the execution and delivery of all required documents and instruments. without limiting the generality of the

agreement. g. each sale option may be exercised by the purchaser (or any eligible transferee, as the case may be) by giving written notice of exercise to the stockholder or stockholders delivering the sale notice within 30 days after the later of receipt of the sale notice or completion of the determination contemplated by the final sentence of paragraph f immediately preceding; and each purchase option may be exercised by the purchaser by giving written notice of exercise to the stockholder or stockholders delivering the sale notice within 30 days of the latest of receipt of the sale notice or completion of the determination contemplated by the final sentence of paragraph f immediately preceding or the expiration of the aforesaid rights of the eligible stockholders. upon receipt of such notice of exercise of the purchase option, the stockholder or stockholders delivering the sale notice shall forthwith, and in any event within 30 days, deliver to the purchaser the certificates representing the shares to be purchased by the purchaser and thereupon the purchaser shall pay such stockholder or stockholders cash in the amount of the purchase price therefor. if the purchaser shall not have exercised either such right and option within the time provided therefor, the stockholder or stockholders delivering the sale notice shall thereafter be free to effect the sale specified in the sale notice, but only to the person or persons specified in the sale notice and in the manner and at the time specified in the sale notice and at the offer price or for the consideration and on the terms specified in the sale notice. if the sale with respect to which the sale notice is given does not occur within the period specified therein (but no later than 120 days after the date of the sale notice), the shares of common stock proposed to be sold will again be subject to the notice and other provisions of this article ii. h. without limiting any other provision herein, all the provisions of this agreement shall apply to all shares of common stock now owned by the stockholders, or each of them, or which may be issued hereafter to the stockholders, or each of

dividend, or which are acquired by the stockholders, or each of them, in any other manner. i. each stock certificate representing shares of the stockholders, or either of them, subject hereto shall contain upon its face or upon the reverse side thereof a legend to the following effect: "this stock certificate represents shares which are subject to the terms and conditions of a stockholders

(b) if any of the registrable securities covered by such registration are sold in an underwritten offering, the corporation or such security holders, as applicable, agree in writing to sell their securities on the same terms and conditions as apply to the registrable securities being sold (except and to the extent any registration rights agreement entered into by the corporation on or prior to september 1, 1992, as in effect on such date [hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the "prior registration agreements"], affords any such securityholder the right to do otherwise, subject to the operation of such holdback agreements contained in the prior registration agreement entered into by such securityholder as shall be no shorter in duration than those in effect as of such date); and (c) if any of the registrable securities covered by such registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the managing underwriters shall not have advised the corporation, the representative or the holders of registrable securities proposed to be subject to such registration that, in their opinion, the total number or dollar amount of the securities requested to be included in such registration by the corporation and/or such other security holders, together with the registrable securities demanded to be registered hereunder, exceeds the number of securities which can be sold in such offering;

the provisions of this paragraph d), such holders shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel to such holders and the incremental amount of registration expenses incurred as a result of their participation unless the corporation has agreed to pay such expenses and, in the opinion of counsel to the corporation, such payment shall not affect the ability of the registrable securities to be qualified under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. e. selection of underwriters. if any of the registrable securities covered by a demand registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering shall be selected by the representative; provided, however, that such investment bankers and managers must be reasonably satisfactory to the corporation. article iv incidental registrations a. not a demand. a registration of registrable securities pursuant to this article iv shall not be counted as a demand registration under article iii hereof. b. notice and request for incidental registration. whenever the corporation proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act, other than pursuant to a demand registration or a registration on forms s-4 or s-8 or comparable forms (hereinafter referred to as an "incidental registration"), the corporation shall give written notice to the representative of its intention to effect such a registration not later than the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth day following receipt by the corporation of notice of exercise of other demand registration rights or (ii) 45 days prior to the anticipated filing date. subject to the provisions of paragraphs d and e of this article iv, and unless the corporation shall have withdrawn, prior to the effective date of such incidental registration, all but not less than all of the securities (other than the registrable securities, or any of them) from such incidental registration, the corporation shall include in such incidental registration all registrable securities with respect to which the corporation has received written requests for inclusion therein within 15 business days after the receipt by the applicable holder of the corporation's notice. the holders of registrable securities shall be permitted to withdraw all or any part of the registrable securities from an incidental registration at any time prior to the effective date of such incidental registration. if an incidental registration is an underwritten offering effected: (i) under paragraph d of this article iv hereof, all persons whose securities are included in the incidental registration shall be obligated to sell their securities on the same terms and conditions as apply to the securities being issued and sold by the corporation, or (in the case of any holder of registrable securities or, subject to the operation of applicable holdback agreements as aforesaid, any party to a prior registration agreement) in the open market on terms and conditions comparable to those normally applicable to offerings in reasonably similar circumstances; or (ii) under paragraph e of this article iv hereof, all persons whose securities are included in the incidental registration shall be obligated to sell their securities on the same terms and conditions as apply to the securities being sold by the person or persons who initiated the incidental registration under said paragraph, or (in the case of any holder of registrable securities or, subject to the operation of applicable holdback agreements as aforesaid, any party to a prior registration agreement) in the open market on terms and conditions comparable to those normally applicable to offerings in reasonably similar circumstances. c. incidental registration expenses. the corporation shall pay all registration expenses (but not selling expenses) related to such registration, or incurred as a result of the

seller), in proportion to the number of shares sold by each, or by such sellers as they may agree. d. priority on underwritten primary registration. if an incidental registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the corporation, and the managing underwriters advise the corporation in writing that in their opinion the total number or dollar amount of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number or dollar amount of securities which can be sold in such offering, the corporation shall include in such registration: (i) first, all securities the corporation proposes to sell; and (ii) second, the registrable securities and such other securities (provided such securities are of the same class as the securities being sold by the corporation) requested to be included in such registration in excess of the number of securities the corporation proposes to sell which, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold (allocated pro rata among the holders of such registrable securities and other securities on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder); except, in the event any party to a prior registration agreement exercises any rights thereunder with respect to such incidental registration, the provisions of such prior registration agreement with respect to such allocation to such party shall supersede the provisions of this paragraph; and except, in the event of the operation of the immediately preceding exception, if the holders of registrable securities requesting such incidental registration would be entitled to include a greater number of shares pursuant to such prior registration agreement as "other securityholders" (or equivalent capacity) thereunder, the provisions of such prior registration agreement (as so applied) with respect to such allocation to such holders shall supersede the provisions of this paragraph. e. priority on underwritten secondary registration. if an incidental registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the corporation's securities, and the managing underwriters advise the corporation in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number of securities which can be sold in such offering, the corporation shall include in such registration: (i) first, all securities requested to be included in such registration by the security holders initiating such registration; and (ii) second, up to the full number of registrable securities and such other securities (provided such securities are of the same class as the securities being sold by the corporation) requested to be included in such registration in excess of the number of securities the security holders initiating such registration propose to sell which, in the opinion of such underwriters, can be sold (allocated pro rata among the holders of such registrable securities and other securities on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder); except, in the event any party to a prior registration agreement exercises any rights thereunder with respect to such incidental registration, the provisions of such prior registration agreement with respect to such allocation to such party shall supersede the provisions of this paragraph; and except, in the event of the operation of the immediately preceding exception, if the holders of registrable securities requesting such incidental registration would be entitled to include a greater number of shares pursuant to such prior registration agreement as "other securityholders" (or equivalent capacity) thereunder, the provisions of such prior registration agreement (as so applied) with respect to such allocation to such holders shall supersede the provisions of this paragraph. f. selection of underwriters. if any incidental registration is an underwritten offering, the corporation shall have the right to select the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers to administer the offering, except as otherwise agreed in a prior registration agreement. article v holdback agreements a. restrictions on public sale by holder of registrable securities. each holder of registrable securities (including those persons deemed to be holders under the final sentence of paragraph b of article ii hereof) whose registrable securities are covered by a registration statement filed pursuant to article iii or iv hereof shall agree, if requested by the managing underwriters, not to effect any public sale or distribution of securities of the corporation of the same class, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such class as the securities included in such registration statement, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act (except as part of such

managing underwriters. the foregoing provisions shall not apply to any holder of registrable securities if such holder is prevented by applicable statute or regulation from entering any such

class of registrable securities commencing on the date of sale of such applicable class of registrable securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for such class) unless it has provided 45 days' prior written notice of such sale or distribution to the underwriter or underwriters. b. restrictions on public sale by the corporation and others. the corporation agrees: (i) not to effect

holder of its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such equity securities to agree not to effect any public sale or distribution of any such

form shall be available for the sale of the registrable securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; provided, however, that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, including documents incorporated by reference

and agreed that the corporation shall, in any event, pay its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit conducted at the end of the corporation's fiscal year in the ordinary course of business, and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the securities to be registered on each securities exchange and securities association. article viii indemnification a. indemnification by corporation. the corporation agrees to indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, each holder of registrable securities, its officers, directors, employees and agents and each person who controls such holder (within the meaning of the securities act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the corporation by such holder expressly for use therein or by such holder's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus after the corporation has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same. the corporation shall also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and each person who controls such persons (within the meaning of the securities act) to the same extent as hereinabove provided with respect to the indemnification of the holders of registrable securities. b. indemnification by holder of registrable securities. in connection with any registration statement in which a holder of registrable securities is participating, each such holder will furnish to the corporation in writing such information and affidavits as the corporation reasonably requests for use in connection with any registration statement or prospectus and agrees to indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, the corporation, its directors and officers and each person who controls the corporation (within the meaning of the securities act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated in the registration statement or prospectus or preliminary prospectus or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such holder to the corporation specifically for inclusion in such registration statement or prospectus. in no event shall the liability of any selling holder of registrable securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. the corporation shall be entitled to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided above with respect to information so furnished in writing by such persons specifically for inclusion in any prospectus or registration statement. c. conduct of indemnification proceedings. any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (a) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (b) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person, or (c) in the reasonable judgment of any such person and the indemnifying party, based upon advice of their respective counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such person). if such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). no indemnifying party shall be required to consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such additional coun- sel or counsels. d. contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article viii is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under paragraphs a or b immediately preceding, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in said paragraphs a or b, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the corporation, on the one hand, and the participating holders of registrable securities, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the corporation on the one hand or such holders on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph d were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the prior provisions of this paragraph d. the amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the prior provisions of this paragraph d shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim that is the subject of this paragraph d. notwith- standing the provisions of this paragraph d, no participating holder of registrable securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received from the sale of its shares exceeds the amount of any damages that it has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. for purposes of this paragraph d no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. article ix rule 144 the corporation covenants, for as long as it is required to do so under the securities act or the exchange act, that it shall file the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and the rules and regulations adopted by the sec thereunder, and it shall take such further action as any holder of registrable securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the sec. upon the request of any holder of registrable secu- rities, the corporation shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such information and requirements. article x participation in underwritten registrations no person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. article xi miscellaneous a. remedies. each holder of registrable securities, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, shall be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement. the corporation agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this agreement and hereby agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. b. term. the registration rights granted under article iii hereof shall terminate on the sixth anniversary of the date hereof, and the registration rights granted under article iv hereof shall terminate on the third anniversary of the maturity of the note. c. notices. all notices,

corporation is given notice by the transferor at the time of such transfer stating the name and address of the transferee and identifying the securities with respect to which the rights under article iii and iv are being assigned. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties understand and agree that the representative may assign all but not less than all of its rights to enforce this agreement in the capacity as representative, subject to the consent of the corporation in the event of such assignment to a person or entity known to the representative to conduct a business in competition with the principal business of the corporation and its subsidiaries, collectively. g. number of shares. all references herein to numbers of shares of registrable securities shall be subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations of the corporation. h. subsequent registration rights. the corporation shall not, from and after the date hereof, grant any registration rights to stephen russell or leonard bennett in a manner that will obligate the corporation to grant identical rights to any other current securityholder of the corporation. i. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york applicable in the case of agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state. j. captions. the captions appearing herein are for the convenience of the parties only and shall not be construed to affect the meaning of the provisions of this agreement.
