(f) to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, all of the directors and executive officers of the reporting persons are citizens of the united states, except that jan leschly is a citizen of denmark. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration the securities were acquired pursuant to tender agreements dated as of february 14, 2001 (the "tender agreements") between travel services and each of the stockholders of sierracities listed on schedule ii hereto (the "stockholders"). the tender agreements were entered into in connection with and as a condition to the execution and delivery of the merger agreement (as defined below). travel services did not pay additional consideration to the stockholders in connection with the execution and delivery of the tender agreements. 5 references to, and descriptions of, the offer (as defined below), the merger (as defined below), the merger agreement and the tender agreements as set forth herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the merger agreement and the tender agreements, respectively, included as exhibits to this schedule 13d, and are incorporated herein in their entirety where such references and descriptions appear. item 4. purpose of transaction (a) - (b) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of february 14, 2001 (the "merger agreement"), among travel services, amtrs corp., a newly formed delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of travel services ("amtrs"), and sierracities, and subject to the conditions set forth therein, amtrs will commence a tender offer (the "offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of sierracities at a purchase price of $5.68 per share (such price, or such higher price as may be paid in the offer, being referred to herein as the "per share amount"), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon. following the completion of the offer, amtrs will merge with and into sierracities and sierracities will become a wholly owned subsidiary of travel services (such events constituting the "merger"). once the merger is consummated, amtrs will cease to exist as a separate corporation and all of the business, assets, liabilities and obligations of amtrs will be merged into sierracities with sierracities remaining as the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation"). as a result of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock, other than shares owned by sierracities, travel services, amtrs, any subsidiary of sierracities or travel services and, if applicable, stockholders exercising appraisal rights, will be converted into the right to receive the per share amount in cash payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the "merger consideration"). pursuant to the merger agreement, each outstanding option to purchase common stock shall be canceled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment (less any applicable tax withholdings) payable by the surviving corporation, equal to the amount, if any, by which the merger consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such sierracities stock option, multiplied by the number of shares then subject to such sierracities stock option. the stockholders have, by executing the tender agreements, agreed to tender in the offer the 3,817,057 shares of common stock beneficially owned by them (the "shares"). the shares constitute approximately 20.1% of the total outstanding shares of common stock as of february 12, 2001. in addition, as part of the tender agreements, each stockholder has granted to travel services an irrevocable proxy to vote or consent in writing, at every sierracities stockholders meeting and on every action or approval by written consent instead of a meeting, (i) in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger, and in favor of each of the other actions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) against any proposal for any recapitalization, merger, sale of assets or other business combination between sierracities and any person or entity (other than the merger) and (iii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or would result in any obligation or agreement of sierracities under the merger agreement not being fulfilled or would result in sierracities being required to pay to parent or purchaser the termination fee described in the merger agreement. the tender agreements terminate upon the earliest of the following: (i) the date upon which the merger agreement is terminated; (ii) the date upon which the merger is effected; (iii) the date upon which all of the stockholders' now owned or hereafter acquired shares of sierracities' common 6 stock are purchased by travel services or amtrs pursuant to the offer and (iv) the date on which the offer terminates without the prompt purchase of common stock thereunder. the purpose of the transactions under the tender agreements are to assist travel services and sierracities in consummating the transactions contemplated under the merger agreement.
