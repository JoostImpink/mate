(ii) separate vote of series a preferred stock. subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock which may hereafter from time to time come into existence, for so long as at least 10% of the series a preferred stock theretofore issued remain outstanding (subject to adjustment for any stock split, reverse stock split or other similar event affecting the series a preferred stock), in addition to any other vote or consent required herein or by law, the vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding series a preferred stock shall be necessary for effecting or validating the following actions: (a) any amendment, alteration, or repeal of any provision of the certificate of incorporation (including this certificate of designation) or the bylaws of the company (including any filing of a certificate of designation), that alters or changes or adversely affects the voting or other powers, preferences, or other special rights or privileges, or restrictions of the series a preferred stock; (b) reclassification or recapitalization of any outstanding shares of securities of the company into shares having rights, preferences or privileges senior to or on a parity with the series a preferred stock; (c) authorization or issuance of any other stock having rights, preferences or privileges senior to or on a parity with the series a preferred stock; (d) reorganization, merger or consolidation with or into any corporation if such reorganization, merger or consolidation would result in the stockholders of the company immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation holding less than a majority of the voting power of the stock of the surviving corporation immediately after such reorganization, merger or consolidation; (e) sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of, or encumbrance of, all or substantially all the company's assets in a single transaction or series of related transactions; (f) liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company; 3 (g) amendment of the certificate of incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock or preferred stock; (h) redemption, purchase or other acquisition by the company, either direct or indirect, of any of the company's capital stock or other equity securities (including any securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities) excluding redemptions, repurchases or other reacquisitions at cost with respect to shares issued in accordance with plans or agreements approved by the board of directors from current or former employees, consultants, advisors or directors upon or in connection with their death, disability or termination of employment with the company and excluding the series a preferred stock pursuant to section (e) below; (i) authorization, declaration or payment of any dividend (other than a stock dividend paid pro rata to the company's stockholders) on any shares of common stock or preferred stock, other than the series a preferred stock; or (j) increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of series a preferred stock; or (k) issuance, reservation or authorization of shares of common stock or any right or option to purchase common stock or other security convertible into common stock to employees, consultants or directors in an amount which would result in total options outstanding at any time exceeding 15% of the total number of shares, warrants and options issued and outstanding immediately after the series a original issue date (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares). (c) liquidation rights. (i) upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any series a junior stock, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence and which is expressly senior to the rights of the series a preferred stock, the holders of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the company an amount per share of series a preferred stock equal to 100% of the series a original issue price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares) for each share of series a preferred stock held by each such holder. if, upon any such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets of the company shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of series a preferred stock, then such assets shall be distributed among the holders of series a preferred stock at the time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. after the payment of the foregoing full 4 liquidation preference of the series a preferred stock and any other distribution that may be required with respect to any series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence and which is expressly senior to the rights of the series a preferred stock, the assets of the company legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of series a preferred stock, on an as converted basis, and the holders of series a junior stock. (ii) the following events shall be considered a liquidation under this section, unless by vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the series a preferred stock then outstanding, such holders waive the right to treat any of the following events as a deemed liquidation: (a) any consolidation or merger of the company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the stockholders of the company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than 50% of the company's voting power immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization, or any transaction or series of related transactions to which the company is a party in which in excess of 50% of the company's voting power is transferred, excluding any consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the company (an "acquisition"); (b) a transaction or a series of related transactions, other than transactions involving a holder of series a preferred stock, in which a majority of the voting power is transferred to a third party (or group of affiliated third parties) who were not previously stockholders of the company; or (c) a sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company (an "asset transfer"). (iii) in any of the events set forth in subparagraph (ii), if the consideration received by the company is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined in good faith by the board of directors. any securities shall be valued as follows: (a) securities not subject to restrictions on free marketability covered by subparagraph (b) below: (1) if traded on a securities exchange or through the nasdaq national market (or a similar national quotation system), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such quotation system over the 30 day period ending three days prior to the closing; 5 (2) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30 day period ending three days prior to the closing; and (3) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the board of directors.

(d) conversion rights. the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have the following rights with respect to the conversion of the series a preferred stock into shares of common stock: (i) optional conversion. subject to and in compliance with the provisions of this section (d), any shares of series a preferred stock may, at the option of the holder, be converted at any time into fully-paid and nonassessable shares of common stock the number of shares of common stock to which a holder of series a preferred stock shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying the "series a preferred conversion rate" then in effect (determined as provided in subsection (ii)) by the number of shares of series a preferred stock being converted. (ii) series a preferred conversion rate. the conversion rate in effect at any time for conversion of the series a preferred stock (the "series a preferred conversion rate") shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the series a original issue price by the "series a preferred conversion price," calculated as provided in subsection (iii) below. 6 (iii) series a preferred conversion price. the conversion price for the series a preferred stock shall initially be $0.70 (the "series a preferred conversion price"). such initial series a preferred conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this section (d). all references to the series a preferred conversion price herein shall mean the series a preferred conversion price as so adjusted. (iv) mechanics of conversion. each holder of series a preferred stock who desires to convert the same into shares of common stock pursuant to this section (d) shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the company or any transfer agent for the series a preferred, and shall give written notice to the company at such office that such holder elects to convert the same. such notice shall state the number of shares of series a preferred being converted. thereupon, the company shall promptly issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay in cash (at the common stock's fair market value determined by the board of directors as of the date of conversion) the value of any fractional share of common stock otherwise issuable to any holder of series a preferred. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificates representing the shares of series a preferred to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of common stock on such date. (v) adjustment upon common stock event. upon the happening of a common stock event (as hereinafter defined) at any time or from time to time after the date that the first share of series a preferred is issued (the "series a original issue date"), the series a preferred conversion price shall, simultaneously with the happening of such common stock event, be adjusted by multiplying the series a preferred conversion price in effect immediately prior to such common stock event by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such common stock event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately after such common stock event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter be the series a preferred conversion price. the series a preferred conversion price shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of each subsequent common stock event. as used in this section (d), the term "common stock event" shall mean (i) the issue by the company of additional shares of common stock as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding common stock, (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares of common stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise), or (iii) a combination or consolidation, by reclassification or otherwise, of the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock. 7 (vi) adjustment for other dividends and distributions. if at any time or from time to time after the series a original issue date the company pays a dividend or makes another distribution to the holders of the common stock (or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution) payable in securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries other than shares of common stock, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of series a preferred stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of common stock receivable upon conversion thereof, the amount of securities of the company which they would have received had their series a preferred stock been converted into common stock on the date of such event (or such record date, as applicable) and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event (or such record date, as applicable) to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this section (d) with respect to the rights of the holders of the series a preferred stock or with respect to such other securities by their terms. (vii) adjustment for reclassification, exchange and substitution. if at any time or from time to time after the series a original issue date, the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an acquisition or asset transfer as defined in section (c) or a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this section (d)), in any such event each holder of series a preferred stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the maximum number of shares of common stock into which such shares of series a preferred stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof. (viii) adjustment for reorganizations, mergers or consolidations. if at any time or from time to time after the series a original issue date, there is a capital reorganization of the common stock or the merger or consolidation of the company with or into another corporation or another entity or person (other than an acquisition or asset transfer as defined in section (c) or a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this section (d)), as a part of such capital reorganization, provision shall be made so that the holders of the series a preferred stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the series a preferred stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the company to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, subject to adjustment in respect of such stock or securities by the terms thereof. 8 in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section (d) with respect to the rights of the holders of series a preferred stock after the capital reorganization to the end that the provisions of this section (d) (including adjustment of the series a preferred conversion price then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent as practicable. (ix) sale of shares below series a preferred conversion price. (a) if at any time or from time to time after the series a original issue date, the company issues or sells, or is deemed by the express provisions of this subsection (ix) to have issued or sold additional shares of common stock (as defined in subsection (ix)(b)(1) below), other than (w) as a dividend or distribution on the series a preferred stock, (x) in connection with a common stock event as provided in subsection (v) above, (y) as a dividend or other distribution on any class of stock as provided in subsection (vi) above, and (z) a subdivision or combination of shares of common stock as provided in subsection (vii) above, for an effective price (as defined in subsection (ix)(b)(4) below) less than the then effective series a preferred conversion price, then and in each such case the then existing series a preferred conversion price shall be reduced, as of the opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price equal to the price per share paid for such additional shares of common stock (but not less than the par value of the common stock). (b) certain definitions. for the purpose of making any adjustment required under this subsection (ix): (1) "additional shares of common stock" shall mean all shares of common stock issued (or, pursuant to this section, deemed to be issued) by the company, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the company, other than: (a) shares of common stock issued or issuable upon exercise of options, warrants (other than outstanding warrants granted in favor of invest inc.), convertible securities or other rights outstanding as of the series a original issue date; and (b) shares of common stock issued or issuable by the company or any subsidiary to employees, officers, directors or consultants pursuant to stock option plans that are permitted by section 7.4 of the series a preferred stock purchase agreement, dated as of february 16, 2001, among the company, scp private equity partners ii, l.p., and icg holdings, inc., unless otherwise approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock; (2) the "aggregate consideration received" by the company for any issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (i) (a) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the gross 9 amount of cash received by the company before deduction of any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions paid or allowed by the company in connection with such issue or sale and without deduction of any expenses payable by the company; (b) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property at the time of such issue as determined in good faith by the board; and (c) if additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or rights or options are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the company for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the board to be allocable to such additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or rights or options or (ii) if no consideration is received by the company, be considered zero; (3) "convertible securities" shall mean any evidence of indebtedness, stock or other securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock; (4) the "effective price" of additional shares of common stock shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the total number of additional shares of common stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold by the company by the provisions of clause (1), into the aggregate consideration received, or deemed to have been received by the company by the provisions of this clause (4), for such issue or sale of such additional shares of common stock; and (5) "rights or options" shall mean warrants, options or other rights to purchase or otherwise acquire shares of common stock or convertible securities. (c) deemed issuances. for the purpose of making any adjustment to the series a preferred conversion price required under this subsection (ix), if the company issues or sells any rights or options or convertible securities (or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities then entitled to receive any such rights or options or convertible securities), then the company shall be deemed (x) to have issued, at the time of the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities, that number of additional shares of common stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights or options or conversion or exchange of such convertible securities upon their issuance (or, in the case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date) and (y) to have received, as the aggregate consideration received for the deemed issuance of such additional shares of common stock, an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the 10 company for the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities, plus, in the case of such rights or options, the minimum total amount of consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the exercise in full of such rights or options (including, with respect to rights or options for convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of consideration payable to the company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such rights or options) upon the conversion or exchange of such underlying convertible securities), plus, in the case of convertible securities, the minimum total amount of consideration, if any, payable to the company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such convertible securities) upon the conversion or exchange thereof; provided that: (1) if the minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the company shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses; (2) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is reduced or the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is increased over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events, other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the series a preferred conversion price computed upon the original issue or deemed issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such decrease or increase becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such decrease or increase, as the case may be (provided, however, that no such adjustment of the series a preferred conversion price shall affect common stock previously issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock); and (3) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is subsequently increased or the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is subsequently decreased, then the series a preferred conversion price computed upon the original issue or deemed issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease, as the case may be, (provided, however, that no such adjustment of the series a preferred conversion price shall af- 11 fect common stock previously issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock, and further provided that no readjustment pursuant to this clause (3) shall have the effect of increasing the series a preferred conversion price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the series a preferred conversion price on the original adjustment date, or (b) the series a preferred conversion price that would have resulted from any issuance of additional shares of common stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date). no further adjustment of the series a preferred conversion price, adjusted upon the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities, shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of common stock on the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of any such convertible securities. if any such rights or options or the conversion rights represented by any such convertible securities shall expire without having been fully exercised, then the series a preferred conversion price as adjusted upon the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall be readjusted to the series a preferred conversion price which would have been in effect had an adjustment been made on the basis that (x) the only additional shares of common stock so issued were the shares of common stock, if any, that were actually issued or sold on the exercise of such rights or options or rights of conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and (y) the consideration received with respect to additional shares of common stock was the consideration actually received by the company upon such exercise of such rights or options, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the company for the granting of all such rights or options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration received for issuing or selling all such convertible securities actually converted or exchanged, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the company (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such convertible securities) on the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities provided, however, that no such adjustment of the series a preferred conversion price shall affect common stock previously issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock. in the case of any rights or options which expire by their terms not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the series a preferred conversion price shall be made (except as to shares of series a preferred stock converted in such period) until the expiration or exercise of all such rights or options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided above. if any such record date shall have been fixed and such rights or options or convertible securities are not issued on the date fixed thereof, the adjustment previously made in the series a preferred conversion price which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and shall instead be made on the actual date of issuance, if any. 12 (x) waiver. the series a preferred conversion price adjustment provisions of this section 4 may be waived by the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding series a preferred stock, voting together as a single class. (xi) certificate of adjustment. in each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the series a preferred conversion price for the number of shares of common stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock, if the series a preferred stock is then convertible pursuant to this section (d), the company, at its expense, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of series a preferred stock at the holder's address as shown in the company's books. the certificate shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or deemed to be received by the company for any additional shares of common stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (ii) the series a preferred conversion price at the time in effect, (iii) the number of additional shares of common stock and (iv) the type and amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the series a preferred stock. (xii) notices of record date. upon (i) any taking by the company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) any acquisition (as defined in section (c)) or other capital reorganization of the company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the company, any merger or consolidation of the company with or into any other corporation, or any asset transfer (as defined in section (c)), or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company, the company shall mail to each holder of series a preferred stock at least 10 days prior to the record date specified therein (or such shorter period approved by a majority of the outstanding series a preferred stock) a notice specifying (a) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (b) the date on which any such acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, asset transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (c) the date, if any, that is to be fixed as to when the holders of record of common stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such acquisition, reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, asset transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. (xiii) automatic conversion. 13 (a) each share of series a preferred stock shall automatically be converted into shares of common stock, based on the then-effective series a preferred conversion price, (a) at any time upon the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock, (b) upon the closing of a qualified public offering, or (c) upon a qualified sale. the term "qualified public offering" shall mean a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of common stock for the account of the company in which (i) the per share price is at least four times the then effective series a preferred conversion price, and (ii) the gross cash proceeds to the company (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) are at least $60,000,000. the term "qualified sale" shall mean an acquisition or asset transfer (as defined in section (c)) which provides for minimum consideration payable with respect to each share of common stock (on a fully diluted basis) of at least three times the then effective series a preferred conversion price in cash or liquid stock. the term "liquid stock" shall mean capital stock which is registered under section 12(b) or section 12(g) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, the disposition of which would not be significantly restricted by low trading volume or otherwise; provided, that capital stock which is either (i) listed for trading on the nasdaq national market system with average daily trading volume over the past six months of at least 100,000 shares, or (ii) listed for trading on the new york stock exchange, inc. shall be deemed to be liquid stock. upon such automatic conversion, any accrued and unpaid dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of section (a). (b) upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in subparagraph (a), the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of series a preferred stock are either delivered to the company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the company to indemnify the company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of the series a preferred stock, the holders of series a preferred stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the office of the company or any transfer agent for the series a preferred stock. thereupon, there shall be issued and delivered to such holder promptly at such office and in its name as shown on such surrendered certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock into which the shares of series a preferred stock surrendered were convertible on the date on 14 which such automatic conversion occurred. if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities pursuant to the securities act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of series a preferred stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the holder entitled to receive the common stock upon conversion of the series a preferred stock shall not be deemed to have converted such series a preferred stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. (xiv) fractional shares. no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock. all shares of common stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of series a preferred stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. if, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share, the company shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the common stock's fair market value (as determined by the board of directors) on the date of conversion. (xv) reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the series a preferred stock, such number of its shares of common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock. if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock, the company will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of common stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose. (xvi) notices. any notice required by the provisions of this section (d) shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) 5 days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) 1 day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with verification of receipt. all notices shall be addressed to each holder of record at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the company. (xvii) payment of taxes. the company will pay all taxes (other than taxes based upon income) and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to the issue or delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of shares of series a preferred stock, excluding any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of common stock in a 15 name other than that in which the shares of series a preferred stock so converted were registered. (xviii) no impairment. the company shall not avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the company, but shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the series a preferred stock against impairment. (xix) satisfaction of accrued dividends. except as otherwise expressly provided, upon the conversion of any shares of series a preferred stock into common stock as provided herein, the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive a payment in satisfaction of all accrued but unpaid dividends, subject to limitations regarding the cancellation of pik shares contained in this section. (e) optional redemption. (i) redemption at option of holders of series a preferred stock. at any time on and after january 20, 2006, at the request of any holder of series a preferred stock, such holder may require the company to redeem all, but not less than all, of the shares of series a preferred stock held by such holder in accordance with the provisions contained in this section (e). in no event shall the company be required to redeem shares in excess of the amount permitted by law; provided, however, that such inability to redeem shall not have any impact or effect upon the per- share series a redemption price (as hereinafter defined). all redemptions shall be made in the order in which notices of redemption are received (with any notice of redemption received within 25 days of delivery of notice by an initial redeeming holder (as hereinafter defined) under subsection (iii) being treated as having been received simultaneously with that of the initial redeeming holder), and, if less than all of the shares submitted for redemption in a particular 25-day period are capable of being redeemed, then such shares shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares that each stockholder submitted for redemption. (ii) redemption price of series a preferred stock. the price at which the series a preferred stock shall be redeemed (the "series a redemption price") shall be equal to the series a original issue price (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares) for each share of series a preferred stock plus accrued but unpaid dividends. (iii) exercise of option to redeem series a preferred stock. if a holder of series a preferred stock desires to exercise such holder's option to redeem all, but not less than all, of such holder's shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to this section (e), such holder (the "initial redeeming holder") must give written notice to the company specifying the number of shares to be redeemed, and the company shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each other holder of series a preferred 16 stock. no later than 25 days after receipt by the company of notice of the initial redeeming holder, if any other holder of series a preferred stock also wishes to redeem all of such holder's shares of series a preferred stock at the same time as the redemption of the shares of the initial redeeming holder, such additional holder shall provide a notice comparable to that of the initial redeeming holder to the company and the company shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each other holder of series a preferred stock. redemptions shall be made on a date 30 calendar days after the date on which the company receives the notice of the initial redeeming holder (or the first business day thereafter). each such date of redemption shall be a "series a redemption date." to receive the series a redemption price, the holder of shares of series a preferred stock must present and surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares (duly endorsed for transfer) to the company at the principal executive offices of the company no later than three business days prior to the series a redemption date. the company shall pay the series a redemption price to, or to the order of, the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. the company shall pay the entire series a redemption price on the series a redemption date. (iv) effect of redemption. from and after the series a redemption date, unless the company shall default in providing for the payment of the series a redemption price, all dividends on such shares requested to be redeemed pursuant to this section (e) shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the holders of any such shares subject to redemption as stockholders of the company with respect to such shares, except the right to receive the series a redemption price, shall cease and terminate. any shares of series a preferred stock that are redeemed by the company shall be retired and shall not be reissued. (v) failure to redeem. if the company shall for any reason fail to redeem any shares of series a preferred stock as required by this section (e), and such failure shall continue for a period of 30 days, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this certificate of designation, with respect to all shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding: (i) the conversion rights set forth in section (d) hereof shall continue beyond any date for redemption specified in said section, and said rights may be exercised at any time; and (ii) the company may not, other than in the ordinary course of business, incur any indebtedness for money borrowed or borrow or reborrow any amounts under any lines of credit or any other borrowing facility which it may then have outstanding without the prior written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, unless the proceeds of such incurrence of such indebtedness or borrowing or reborrowing are to be used to make all redemptions then required to be made; and (iii) dividends shall continue to accrue and be paid in accordance with and as defined in section (a), and, to the extent not paid, shall be added to the series a redemption price. nothing herein shall limit the company's obligations to redeem as set forth above, or limit the remedies available to the holders of series a preferred stock in the event of a failure of the company to honor such obligations. 17 (f) waiver. any rights of the holders of series a preferred stock set forth herein may be waived by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding. (g) limitation on reissuance of shares. no share of shares of series a preferred stock acquired by the company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be cancelled, retired and eliminated from the shares that the company is authorized to issue. 18 exhibit c --------- schedule of purchasers - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ purchaser number of shares purchase price number of warrants purchase price for for shares warrants - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ scp private equity partners 214,286 $15,000,020 28,571,429 $285.71 ii, l.p. building 300 435 devon park drive wayne, pa 19087-1993 attn: wayne weisman telephone: 610 254-4124 facsimile: 610 975-9546 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ icg holdings, inc. 142,858 $10,000,060 14,285,720 $142.86 pencador corporate center 100 lake drive, suite 4 newark, de 19742 attn: henry nassau telephone: 302 292-3971 facsimile: 302 292-3972 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ exhibit d --------- breakaway solutions, inc. investor rights agreement investor rights agreement this investor rights agreement (the "agreement") is made as of the _____ day of march, 2001, by and between breakaway solutions, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), scp private equity partners ii, l.p., a delaware limited partnership ("scp"), and icg holdings, inc., a delaware corporation ("icg").

and the company will pay to such holder, partner, officer, director, underwriter or controlling person, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defendant any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.4(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by such holder, partner, officer, director, underwriter or controlling person. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed a shelf registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the act, any underwriter, and any controlling person of any such underwriter, each other holder, each of its partners, officers and directors and any controlling person of any such holder, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the act, or the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise 5 out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such shelf registration statement; and the holder will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this subsection 1.4(b), in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.4(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this subsection 1.4(b) exceed the gross proceeds from the offering related to such shelf registration statement received by the holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 1.4 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 1.4, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 1.4 but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 1.4. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 1.4 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 6 (e) the obligations of the company and holders under this section 1.4 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities relating to the shelf registration statement covering such securities, and otherwise. 1.5. reports under the securities exchange act of 1934. the company shall ------------------------------------------------- cause its common stock to continue to be registered under sections 12(b) or 12(g) of the 1934 act, shall comply in all respects with its reporting and filing obligations under the 1934 act, and shall not take any action or file any document (whether or not permitted by the 1934 act or the rules thereunder) to terminate or suspend such registration or to terminate or suspend its reporting and filing obligations under the 1934 act. the company shall use its best efforts to continue the listing of its common stock on the automated quotation system of the national association of securities dealers, and shall comply in all material respects with its reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of such exchange or association. 1.6. assignment of registration rights. the rights to cause the company to --------------------------------- register registrable securities pursuant to this article 1 may be assigned (but only with all related obligations) by a holder to one or more transferees of the registrable securities; provided: (i) the company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned; (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions

the act. 1.7. limitations on subsequent registration rights. from and after the date --------------------------------------------- of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders representing in the aggregate at least 50% of the then outstanding registrable securities, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company which would allow such holder or prospective holder to interfere with or otherwise limit a holder's registration rights under this agreement. 1.8. investor information. each holder who includes registrable securities -------------------- in any registration pursuant to this article i shall promptly furnish to the company such information regarding such holder and the distribution

statement and will otherwise cooperate with the investor in conducting an investigation for the purpose of reducing or eliminating such investor's exposure to liability under the act, including the reasonable production of information at the company's headquarters; provided, that the company shall not be required to disclose any confidential information to or meet at its headquarters with any investor until and unless the investor shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company with the company with respect thereto; and (d) such other information relating to the financial condition, business, prospects or corporate affairs of the company as an investor may from time to time request, provided, however, that the company

("scp") and icg holdings, inc. ("icg") have entered into a bridge financing facility with breakaway solutions, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), pursuant to which each of scp and icg have made bridge loans to the company and may make additional loans to the company, as evidenced and to be evidenced by the company's promissory notes (the "bridge notes"). the bridge notes held and to be held by scp are referred to as the "scp bridge notes", and the bridge notes held and to be held by icg are referred to as the "icg bridge notes". it is understood between scp and icg that all fundings of new money to the company under the bridge notes shall be on the basis of $2 by scp to every $1 by icg. in recognition of the $2.4 million of new money most recently advanced by icg to the company, scp shall advance to the company on the date hereof, $4.8 million. all subsequent fundings under the bridge notes shall maintain the same $2 to $1 relationship. icg represents to scp that it has reserved sufficient funds to allow it to hereafter extend an additional $2.6 million under the icg bridge notes concurrently with advances of $5.2 million by scp, should it and scp agree that the company qualifies for such advances. scp and icg are this day entering into a series a preferred stock purchase agreement, among scp, icg, and the company (the "purchase agreement"), pursuant to which, inter alia, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (1) scp and icg have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 357,143 shares (the "initial shares") of the company's series a preferred stock, $0.0001 par value (the "series a stock"), (2) scp has committed to purchase from the company an additional 71,429 shares of series a stock, and (3) scp has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 28,571,429 warrants to purchase shares of common stock, $0.000125 par value (the "common stock"), of which 21,428,571 warrants are referred to as the "initial warrants." section 1.2 of the purchase agreement provides that at the closing of the purchase of the series a stock, scp and icg (the "purchasers") shall deliver the bridge notes held by them to the company for cancellation, and the outstanding principal amounts of such bridge notes plus accrued interest shall be applied on account of the purchase price of the series a stock. section 1.2 further provides that the balance of the purchase price of the series a stock is payable in installments if, as and when the company satisfies certain conditions. at the closing, scp will purchase, inter alia, 60% of the initial shares (the "scp initial shares") and 60% of the initial warrants (the "scp initial warrants"), and icg will purchase 40% of the initial shares (the "icg initial shares") and 40% of the initial warrants (the "icg initial warrants"). scp and icg recognize that certain circumstances could exist that would result in icg paying on account of the purchase price of the icg initial shares ("icg's purchase contribution") an amount greater than 40% of the total amount paid by both scp and icg on account of the purchase price of the initial shares ("total purchase contribution"). (the fraction obtained by dividing icg's percentage contribution by the total purchase contribution is referred to as "icg's contribution share.") in order to rectify potential disparities in the relative cash contributions to the company by scp and icg on account of the purchase price of the initial shares, scp and icg agree that if (1) during a four-week period following (a) the closing or (b) such time as a request (as defined in the purchase agreement) or requests in the amount necessary to satisfy scp's funding obligations under the proviso set forth in the last sentence of section 1.2(b) of the purchase agreement are made, no additional payments to the company on account of the purchase price of the initial shares are made because of either the failure of the company to satisfy the conditions precedent to such additional payments or scp's breach, (2) if scp and icg shall sooner agree that the company is unlikely to qualify for additional payments on account of the purchase price for a period of at least that duration, or (3) if icg shall have made an additional payment to the company on account of the purchase of the initial shares in response to a valid request and in the amount required to be paid by icg pursuant to the terms of section 1.2(b) of the purchase agreement and scp does not pay the full amount that it is required to pay pursuant to the terms of section 1.2(b) of the purchase agreement in connection with such request within five (5) business days of icg's payment, then scp shall promptly deliver to icg a sufficient number of initial shares and a sufficient number of initial warrants such that (1) the fraction obtained by dividing icg's total ownership of initial shares by the total number of initial shares owned by both scp and icg shall equal icg's contribution share, and (2) the fraction obtained by dividing icg's total ownership of initial warrants by the total number of initial warrants owned by both scp and icg shall equal icg's contribution share. should, for any reason, the situation be reversed and icg's purchase contribution be less than 40% on or after closing, it shall rectify this disparity by delivering initial shares and initial warrants to scp in the same fashion as scp is obligated to do under the foregoing paragraph. in the event that after a disparity is rectified in accordance with the terms of this letter agreement the company qualifies for additional payments on account of the purchase price of -2- the initial shares, icg or scp, as applicable, shall from time to time as appropriate return to the other party such number of initial shares and initial warrants so that after such payments, each party owns such number of initial shares and initial warrants as corresponds with its respective contribution share. scp shall support, and shall cause directors designated by it to support, an agreement between icg and the company pursuant to which the board seat currently occupied by walter w. buckley will be occupied by an icg designee from and after the time walter w. buckley vacates such seat until such time as icg no longer owns at least 10% of the company on a primary basis. scp shall vote its shares on favor of, and cause the directors designated by it to vote in favor of, such icg designee. if the foregoing correctly set forth our understanding, please sign where indicated below. very truly yours, scp private equity partners ii, l.p. by: scp private equity ii general partner, l.p., its general partner by: scp private equity ii, llc, its manager by: /s/ wayne b. weisman ____________________________________ name: wayne b. weisman ___________________________ title: manager ____________________________ confirmed and agreed to: icg holdings, inc. by: /s/ henry n. nassau ________________________________ name: henry n. nassau title: managing director and general counsel date: february 16, 2001 -3- ex-4 5 0005.txt letter agreement, dated as of february 16, 2001 exhibit 4 scp equity partners ii, l.p. building 300 435 devon park drive wayne, pa 19087 as of february 16, 2001 icg holdings, inc. pencador corporate center 100 lake drive, suite 4 newark, de 19742 attention: henry nassau breakaway solutions, inc. 3 clock tower place, 4th floor maynard, ma 01754 attn: corporate secretary re: series a preferred stock purchase agreement (the "purchase agreement"), dated as of february 16, 2001, among breakaway solutions, inc.
