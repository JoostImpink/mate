obligations and rights under the support agreement will not apply and will be suspended for so long as such change of recommendation by the board of directors of reachlocal remains in effect. if the board of directors of reachlocal withdraws such change of recommendation and renews its recommendation with respect to the offer, such suspended obligations and rights of the supporting shareholders will remain in full force and effect. after the consummation of the offer, purchaser intends to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable. at the effective time of the merger, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form of purchaser&#146;s certificate of incorporation (except with respect to name);
