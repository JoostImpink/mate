meeting of lauro 57 to be resolved with the favourable vote of more than 70% of the share capital of lauro 57. the cash consideration(s) paid to lauro 57 for the above mentioned sale(s) will be distributed, without delay and pro-rata , to the shareholders, net of the relevant costs and expenses borne by the company and in compliance with any applicable provision of law. h. further distributions to the shareholders will be also distributed, without delay and pro-rata , to the shareholders (net of the relevant costs and expenses borne by the company and in compliance with any applicable provision of law) the portion of the cash amount of the euticals consideration which will not be deposited in escrow pursuant to the spa and which will be therefore actually paid to lauro 57 simultaneously with the sale of euticals, the portion of the above-mentioned spa&rsquo;s escrow which will be released from time to time in favour of the company (if any) and any further cash amount paid to lauro 57 pursuant to the spa and its ancillary agreements. i. transfer to the shareholders of the amri&rsquo;s shares owned by lauro 57 unless otherwise agreed in writing, after 30 (thirty) months following the completion of the sale of euticals to amri pursuant to the spa, the shareholders of lauro 57 will cause the company to transfer to the same shareholders without delay the portion of the amri&rsquo;s shares still unsold at that date, with technical modalities to be agreed in good faith, including, without limitation, a partial demerger of lauro 57, the partial withdrawal of the shareholders from the company or the distribution of a dividend in kind to the same shareholders. l. duration of the shareholders&rsquo;
