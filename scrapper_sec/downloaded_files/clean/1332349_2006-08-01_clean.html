ric reporting persons ------------------------------------ on may 12, 2006, the issuer entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "arc merger agreement") with beta merger sub corporation, a delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer ("merger sub"), and american retirement corporation, a tennessee corporation ("arc"), pursuant to which merger sub was merged with and into arc (the "arc merger") with arc continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer. pursuant to the arc merger agreement, the issuer agreed to purchase all issued and outstanding shares of arc common stock for $33.00 per share in cash, and all shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options for the excess, if any, of $33.00 over the applicable exercise price, for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.2 billion in cash, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the arc merger agreement. also on may 12, 2006, in connection with the execution of the arc merger agreement, the issuer entered into an investment agreement (the "investment agreement") with ric, pursuant to which ric committed to purchase from the issuer, at the closing of the arc merger (the "arc closing"), up to $1.3 billion in the aggregate of the issuer's common stock at a price per share of $36.93. prior to the arc closing, in connection with a public offering of the issuer's equity securities and pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement, the $1.3 billion aggregate commitment from ric was reduced to $650.0 million. the purchase of the shares by ric closed simultaneously with the arc closing. this issuance of these securities was made pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by section 4(2) of the securities act of 1933, as amended. on may 25, 2006, in connection with the arc merger, the issuer's board of directors unanimously approved an amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of directors from not more than seven members to not more than eight members, in the event that the issuer decides to offer a current member of the board of directors of arc or some other qualified individual the opportunity to join its board of directors after the consummation of the arc merger. as of the date of this statement, the issuer has no arrangement with any individual to join its board of directors. the investment agreement is filed hereto as exhibit 1.2 and is incorporated herein by reference, and any description thereof is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. shares held by existing reporting persons and june transfer reporting persons ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- in september 2005, the issuer entered into a conveyance agreement with certain equity holders of its predecessor entities, including certain of the existing reporting persons, pursuant to which the equity holders of these entities received an aggregate of 58,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for all of their equity interests in these entities and became direct owners of 100% of the issuer's common stock prior to its initial public offering. pursuant to the conveyance agreement, the existing reporting persons acquired the beneficial ownership of 43,407,000 shares of common stock, of which (i) 9,929,000 shares were held directly by fba, (ii) 13,228,000 were held directly by fit-alt, and (iii) 20,000,000 were held directly by fit ii. on june 28, 2006, the following distributions and contributions of common stock were made (together, the "june transfers"): (i) fba distributed all of the shares of the issuer's common stock beneficially owned by it to its two members, frit, which received 9,102,708 shares, and fbif, which received 826,292 shares; (ii) frit contributed 7,400,000 of the shares of common stock received from fba to fith; and (iii) fit ii contributed the 20,000,000 shares of common stock beneficially owned by it to frith. following the june transfers, the june transfer reporting persons beneficially owned 29,929,000 shares of common stock. in connection with the closing of the initial public offering of the issuer, fit-alt, fba, and fit ii entered into a stockholders agreement with health partners, a bermuda exempted partnership ("hp" and, together with fit-alt, fba, and fit ii, the "stockholders"), dated as of november 28, 2005. upon the consummation of the june transfers, the issuer and each of frit, fbif, frith and fith agreed that each of frit, fbif, frith and fith will be considered a "stockholder" and a "fortress stockholder" (as defined below) for purposes of the stockholders agreement and will be bound by all of the restrictions and obligations of the stockholders agreement. upon consummation of the arc merger, the issuer, the stockholders and ric agreed that ric will be considered a "stockholder" and a "fortress stockholder" for purposes of the stockholders agreement and will be bound by all of the restrictions and obligations of the stockholders agreement. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, the issuer granted to the stockholders, for so long as such stockholders collectively and beneficially own an amount of the issuer's common stock at least equal to 5% or more of the shares issued and outstanding immediately after the consummation of its initial public offering (a "registrable amount"), "demand" registration rights that allow them at any time to request that the issuer register under the securities act of 1933, as amended, an amount equal to or greater than 5% of the common stock outstanding on the date such demand is made. each of the stockholders is entitled to an aggregate of two demand registrations. the issuer is not required to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for more than 60 days. the issuer is also not required to effect any demand registration within six months of a "firm commitment" underwritten offering to which the requestor held "piggyback" rights and which included at least 50% of the securities requested by the requestor to be included. the issuer is not obligated to grant a request for a demand registration within four months of any other demand registration, and may refuse a request for demand registration if in its reasonable judgment, it is not feasible for the issuer to proceed with the registration because of the unavailability of audited financial statements. the issuer granted the stockholders "piggyback" registration rights that allow them to include the shares of common stock that they own in any public offering of equity securities initiated by the issuer (other than those public offerings pursuant to registration statements on forms s-4 or s-8) or by any of the issuer's other stockholders that have registration rights. the "piggyback" registration rights of these stockholders are subject to proportional cutbacks based on the manner of the offering and the identity of the party initiating such offering. the issuer granted the stockholders, for so long as each beneficially owns a registrable amount, the right to request a shelf registration on form s-3 providing for an offering of the shares of common stock owned by such stockholders to be made on a continuous basis, subject to a time limit on the issuer's efforts to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective and the issuer's right to suspend the use of the shelf registration prospectus for a reasonable period of time (not exceeding 60 days in succession or 90 days in the aggregate in any 12 month period) if the issuer determines that certain disclosures required by the shelf registration statement would be detrimental to it or its stockholders. in addition, each stockholder that has not made a request for a shelf registration may elect to participate in such shelf registration within ten days after notice of the registration is received. the issuer agreed to indemnify each of the stockholders against any losses or damages resulting from any untrue statement or omission of material fact in any registration statement or prospectus pursuant to which they sell shares of the issuer's common stock, unless such liability arose from such stockholder's misstatement or omission, and each such stockholder has agreed to indemnify the issuer against all losses caused by its misstatements or omissions. the issuer will pay all expenses incident to its performance under the stockholders agreement, and the stockholders will pay their respective portions of all underwriting discounts, commissions and transfer taxes relating to the sale of their shares under the stockholders agreement. the stockholders agreement is filed hereto as exhibit 1.3 and is incorporated herein by reference, and any description thereof is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. except as set forth above, each reporting person has no present plans or intentions which would result in or relate to any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) and (b). for the

beneficially own more than 50% of the voting power of the company. the reporting persons disclaim membership of a "group" with hp and disclaim beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock

(c) if an indemnifying party chooses to defend any claim, the applicable indemnitee shall make available to such indemnifying party any personnel or any books, records or other documents within its control that are reasonably necessary or appropriate for such defense. (d) if the aggregate amount of any loss shall, at any time subsequent to payment pursuant to this agreement, be reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise, the amount of such reduction, net of any expenses incurred in connection therewith or additional losses incurred, shall promptly be repaid by the applicable indemnitee to the applicable indemnifying party. (e) in the event of payment by an indemnifying party to any indemnitee in connection with any claim, such indemnifying party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such indemnitee may have any right or claim relating to such claim. such indemnitee shall cooperate with such indemnifying party in a reasonable manner, and, at the cost and expense of such indemnifying party, in prosecuting any subrogated right or claim. section 9.4 sole remedy. except in the case of fraud, the rights to indemnification provided for in this article ix for a breach of representations or warranties by the investor (in the case of indemnification pursuant to section 9.2(b)(i)) or the company (in the case of indemnification pursuant to section 9.2(a)(i)) shall constitute the sole post-closing remedy of the company and the investor respectively, for such breach, and the company and the investor shall have no other liability or damages to the other party resulting from any such breach. 25 article x miscellaneous ------------- section 10.1 governing law. this agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal and substantive laws of the state of new york without giving effect to conflicts of law principles thereof. section 10.2 jurisdiction;

(c) any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligation, except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such failure to provide such notice on a timely basis. (d) in any case in which any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not (so long as it shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle the matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, supervision and monitoring (unless (i) such indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to the defenses available to such indemnifying party or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed 22 within a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and the indemnified party is or is reasonably likely to be prejudiced by such delay, in either event the indemnified party shall be promptly reimbursed by the indemnifying party for the expenses incurred in connection with retaining separate legal counsel). an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of an action or claim effected without its consent. the indemnifying party shall lose its right to defend, contest, litigate and settle a matter if it shall fail to diligently contest such matter (except to the extent settled in accordance with the next following sentence). no matter shall be settled by an indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, it being understood that the indemnified party shall not be deemed to be unreasonable in withholding its consent if the proposed settlement imposes any obligation on the indemnified party other than the payment of money). (e) the indemnification provided for under this agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified person and will survive the transfer of the registrable securities and the termination of this agreement. (f) if recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions for any reason or reasons other than as specified therein, any person who would otherwise be entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall nevertheless be entitled to contribution with respect to any losses with respect to which such person would be entitled to such indemnification but for such reason or reasons. in determining the amount of contribution to which the respective persons are entitled, there shall be considered the persons' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. it is hereby agreed that it would not necessarily be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. notwithstanding the foregoing, no selling holder or transferee thereof shall be required to make a contribution in excess of the net amount received by such holder from its sale of registrable securities in connection with the offering that gave rise to the contribution obligation. (g) not less than five business days before the expected filing date of each registration statement pursuant to this agreement, the company shall notify each stockholder who has timely provided the requisite notice hereunder entitling the stockholder to register registrable securities in such registration statement of the information, documents and instruments from such stockholder that the company or any underwriter reasonably requests in connection with such registration statement, including, but not limited to a questionnaire, custody agreement, power of attorney, lock-up letter and underwriting agreement (the "requested information"). if the company has not received, on or before the second day before the expected filing date, the requested information from such stockholder, the company may file the registration statement without including registrable securities of such stockholder. the failure to so include in 23 any registration statement the registrable securities of a stockholder (with regard to that registration statement) shall not in and of itself result in any liability on the part of the company to such stockholder. article vi miscellaneous section 6.1 headings. the headings in this agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not control or effect the meaning or construction of any provisions hereof. section 6.2 entire agreement. this agreement constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein, and there are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or undertakings with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein. this agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. section 6.3 further actions; cooperation. each of the stockholders agrees to use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this agreement. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the stockholders (i) acknowledges that the stockholders will prepare and file with the commission filings under the exchange act, including under section 13(d) of the exchange act, relating to their beneficial ownership of the common stock and (ii) agrees to use its reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with the other parties in promptly preparing, reviewing and executing any such filings under the exchange act, including any amendments thereto. section 6.4 notices. all notices, requests, consents and other communications hereunder to any party shall be deemed to be sufficient if contained in a written instrument delivered in person or sent by telecopy, nationally recognized overnight courier or first class registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to such party at the address set forth below or such other address as may hereafter be designated on the signature pages of this agreement or in writing by such party to the other parties: (a) if to any of the fortress stockholders, to: c/o fortress investment group llc 1251 avenue of the americas, 16th floor new york, ny 10020 fax: (212) 798-6122 attn: randal a. nardone 24 with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to: skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp 4 times square new york, ny 10036-6522 fax: (212) 735-2000 attn: joseph a. coco, esq.
