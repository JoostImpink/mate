(c) the rights of ees under this section 3.4 with respect to any proposed transfer of offered securities may be transferred in whole but not in part by ees, without any consent or other action on the part of any other party hereto, to any ees group holder or to an affiliate of any ees group holder. 3.5 co-sale provisions.

(b) in connection with any proposed transfer that is subject to this section 3.5, the transferring party shall give written notice to each other party of the participation offer (the "co-sale notice") at least twenty (20) days prior to any proposed transfer that is subject to this section 3.5. the co-sale notice shall specify the proposed transferee, the number of and types of transferred securities to be transferred to such transferee, the amount and type of consideration to be received therefor, if applicable, a description of any consideration to be received by the transferring party in connection with the proposed transfer and any transactions related thereto that has not been allocated by the proposed purchaser or transferring party to shares of common stock or common stock equivalents (the "proposed consideration allocation"), and the place and date on which the transfer is expected to be consummated. the co-sale notice shall include an offer (the "participation offer") by the transferring party to include in the proposed transfer on the terms described in paragraph (c) below a number of shares of common stock or common stock equivalents designated by any of the other parties, not to exceed, in respect of any such other party, the product of (a) the aggregate number of transferred securities to be sold by the transferring party to the proposed transferee and (b) a fraction with a numerator equal to the number of shares of fully-diluted common stock held by such other party and a denominator equal to the number of shares of fully-diluted common stock held by all parties; provided that for purposes of the foregoing, a share of common stock, a share of non-voting common stock, a special warrant to acquire one share of common stock or non-voting common stock and an investor warrant to acquire one share of common stock or non-voting common stock shall all be deemed to be equivalent except that if a party elects to include special warrants or investor warrants pursuant to the participation offer, then (i) if the consideration to be received in connection with the sale of the transferred securities is cash, then the consideration to be received by a party transferring special warrants or investor warrants shall be reduced by the aggregate exercise price of all such warrants to be included and (ii) if the consideration to be received in connection with the sale of the transferred securities includes non-cash consideration, then a party may include special warrants or investor warrants only if such party tenders in connection with such sale cash in the aggregate amount of the exercise price of such warrants; provided further, however, that a party may not include investor warrants in any such sale without first including all shares of common stock, non-voting common stock and special warrants owned by it or its affiliates. (c) except as set forth herein and in paragraph (b) above, the consideration to be received for any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents included in a proposed transfer hereunder shall be the same consideration to be received by the transferring party as set forth in the participation offer (giving effect to the proposed consideration allocation, if applicable). each party who wishes to include shares of common stock and common stock equivalents in the proposed transfer in accordance with the terms set forth in the participation offer shall so notify the transferring party not more than fifteen (15) days after the date of the co-sale notice, failing which such party shall not be entitled to participate in the proposed transfer; provided that if the participation offer includes a proposed consideration allocation and the holders of at least a majority of the shares of common stock or common stock equivalents that would be entitled to participate in such proposed transfer pursuant to this section 3.5 object to the fairness of such proposed consideration allocation, such holders may deliver notice of such objection to the transferring party and the company (an "objection notice") within such fifteen (15)-day period, upon which the following terms will apply. upon timely receipt of an objection notice, the company will as promptly as practicable hire a nationally recognized investment banking firm, not affiliated with any party and reasonably acceptable to the special committee and the transferring party, to evaluate the fairness of the proposed consideration allocation using customary investment banking valuation techniques and, if such investment banking firm determines that such proposed consideration allocation does not represent a fair allocation of the value of the consideration to be received in connection with the proposed transaction to the common stock and common stock equivalents to be included in such proposed transfer, to determine a revised allocation that in the judgment of such investment banking firm would be fair (a "revised consideration allocation"). the company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the investment banking firm to make the foregoing determinations within twenty (20) days of receipt of an objection notice. the transferring party will as promptly as practicable provide such investment banking firm with such information concerning the proposed transfer and related transactions as shall reasonably be requested by such investment banking firm subject to the execution and delivery of a customary confidentiality agreement. the investment banking firm shall notify the company, the transferring party and each other party of its determination, including the terms of its revised consideration allocation, if any (the "determination notice"). if the investment banking firm determines that the proposed consideration allocation was fair, then each party who wishes to include shares of common stock and common stock equivalents in the proposed transfer in accordance with the terms set forth in the participation offer shall so notify the transferring party not more than ten (10) days after the date of the determination notice, failing which such party shall not be entitled to participate in the proposed transfer. if the investment banking firm determines that the proposed consideration allocation was not fair and provides a revised consideration allocation, then each party who wishes to include shares of common stock and common stock equivalents in the proposed transfer in accordance with the terms set forth in the participation offer revised to reflect the revised consideration allocation shall so notify the transferring party not more than ten (10) days after the date of the determination notice, failing which such party shall not be entitled to participate in the proposed transfer; provided, however, that in any event, the transferring party may elect not to proceed with the proposed transfer for any reason. the fees and expenses of any investment banking firm hired for the foregoing purposes shall be borne by the company. (d) the participation offer shall be conditioned upon the transferring party's transfer of transferred securities pursuant to the transactions contemplated in the co-sale notice with the transferee named therein. if any other party or other parties have accepted the participation offer, the transferring party shall reduce to the extent necessary the number of transferred securities it otherwise would have transferred in the proposed transfer so as to permit other parties who have accepted the participation offer to sell the number of shares that they are entitled to sell under this section 3.5, and the transferring party and such other party or other parties shall sell the number of shares specified in the participation offer to the proposed transferee in accordance with the terms of such sale as set forth in the co-sale notice. any party other than the transferring party who participates in a transfer under this section 3.5 shall not be liable for any transaction costs associated with such a transfer other than the legal costs incurred by that party and, if the transferring party is obligated to pay selling commissions, then a pro rata portion of such selling commissions. (e) each such party to a transfer pursuant to this section 3.5 shall not be required to make any representations or warranties in connection with such transfer other than representations and warranties as to (i) such person's ownership of the shares of common stock and common stock equivalents to be transferred free and clear of all liens, claims and other encumbrances other than those arising under this agreement, (ii) such party's power and authority to effect such transfer, and (iii) such matters pertaining to compliance with securities laws as the transferee may reasonably require. (f) the closing of such purchase by the transferee shall be on the same date that the transferee acquires transferred securities from the transferring party, provided that such other parties are given twenty (20) days advance notice of such closing; provided further, however, that any such closing shall be delayed, to the extent required until two (2) business days following the expiration of any required waiting periods under the hsr act and the fpa and the obtaining of all other governmental approvals reasonably deemed necessary by a party. (g) each party who participates in a transfer pursuant to this section 3.5 shall promptly perform, whether before or after any such closing, such additional acts (including, without limitation, executing and delivering additional documents) as are reasonably required to effect more fully the transactions contemplated by this section 3.5. 3.6 drag along rights. (a) for as long as ees and cortez and their respective affiliates and other ees group holders that received common stock or common stock equivalents in a transfer subject to section 3.5(a)(iii) (the "ees parties") own at least a majority of the fully-diluted common stock, then, subject to paragraph (c) below, in connection with any transfer for value of all of the shares of common stock and common stock equivalents owned by the ees parties to any person, other than an affiliate of ees or cortez, the ees parties shall have the right to require all other parties to sell all, but not less than all, of their shares of common stock and common stock equivalents on the terms described in paragraph (b) below; provided that for purposes of calculating the value of investor warrants and special warrants transferred pursuant to this section 3.6, the value of such investor warrants and special warrants shall be deemed to be the value of the shares of common stock subject to such warrants, less the aggregate exercise price thereof, and provided further that the non-voting common stock shall be deemed to have the same value as undesignated common stock for such purpose. (b) in connection with any proposed transfer subject to this section 3.6, the ees parties shall give written notice to each other party at least twenty (20) days prior to such transfer, which notice shall specify the amount and type of consideration to be received for the common stock and common stock equivalents to be received by the ees parties in connection with such transfer, if applicable, a proposed consideration allocation (as defined in section 3.5(b)), and the place and date on which the transfer is expected to be consummated (a "drag-along notice"). the consideration to be received by the parties other than the ees parties in a transfer governed by this section 3.6 shall be equal to the consideration to be received by the ees parties (subject to paragraph (a) above) as reflected in the drag-along notice (including giving effect to any proposed consideration allocation, if applicable), unless (i) the drag-along notice includes a proposed consideration allocation, and (ii) the holders of at least a majority of the shares of common stock or common stock equivalents that would be obligated to participate in such proposed transfer pursuant to this section 3.6 object to the fairness of such proposed consideration allocation and deliver an objection notice (as defined in section 3.5(c)) to the ees parties within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the drag-along notice, in which case the following provisions shall apply. upon timely receipt of an objection notice, the company will as promptly as practicable hire a nationally recognized investment banking firm, not affiliated with any party and reasonably acceptable to the special committee and the transferring party, to evaluate the fairness of the proposed consideration allocation as in the same manner as set forth in section 3.5(c) (including, if applicable, to determine a revised consideration allocation as described therein). the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the investment banking firm to make the foregoing determinations within twenty (20) days of receipt of an objection notice. the ees parties will as promptly as practicable provide such investment banking firm with such information concerning the proposed transfer and related transactions as shall reasonably be requested by such investment banking firm subject to the execution and delivery of a customary confidentiality agreement. the investment banking firm shall notify the company, the ees parties and each other party of its determination, including the terms of its revised consideration allocation, if any. if the investment banking firm determines that the proposed consideration allocation was fair, then the other parties shall be obligated to sell their shares of common stock and common stock equivalents on the terms set forth in the drag-along notice. if the investment banking firm determines that the proposed consideration allocation was not fair and provides a revised consideration allocation, then the ees parties may elect, by notice to the other parties, either to not proceed with the proposed transaction, or to modify the terms of the proposed transaction to give effect to the revised consideration allocation, whereupon each other party shall be obligated to sell its shares of common stock and common stock equivalents on terms that give effect to such revised consideration allocation. the fees and expenses of any investment banking firm hired for the foregoing purposes shall be borne by the company. (c) the obligation of any party to sell its shares of common stock and common stock equivalents owned by such party pursuant to this section 3.6 shall apply (i) during the period ending on the first anniversary of this agreement, if and only if the proposed transaction is approved by the special committee, and (ii) with respect to an initial party, after the first anniversary of the date of this agreement, if and only if such initial party would (in connection with the proposed transaction) realize an internal rate of return of at least thirty percent (30%) per annum, calculated based on the party's aggregate initial investment in the company and giving effect to all dividends and other distributions or amounts received in respect of the common stock and common stock equivalents initially purchased by such party with any non-cash consideration reasonably valued in good faith by the special committee at the time of the distribution thereof, and if an initial party has transferred any common stock or common stock equivalents prior to the proposed sale under section 3.6, then with the calculation of such internal rate of return assuming no such transfers had occurred and that such initial party then retained such transferred common stock and common stock equivalents. (d) each party to a transfer pursuant to this section 3.6 shall not be required to make any representations or warranties in connection with such transfer other than representations and warranties as to (i) such person's ownership of the shares of common stock and common stock equivalents to be transferred free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, (ii) such party's power and authority to effect such transfer, and (iii) such matters pertaining to compliance with securities laws as the transferee may reasonably require. (e) the closing of such purchase by the transferee shall be on the same date that the transferee acquires securities from the ees parties (it being acknowledged that in no event shall the ees parties be obligated to transfer any securities and the investor group holders shall not be obligated to transfer any securities unless and until the ees parties transfer securities hereunder), provided that such other parties are given twenty (20) days advance notice of such closing; provided further, however, that any such closing shall be delayed, to the extent required until two (2) business days following the expiration of any required waiting periods under the hsr act and the fpa and the obtaining of all other governmental approvals reasonably deemed necessary by a party. (f) each party who participates in a transfer pursuant to this section 3.6 shall promptly perform, whether before or after any such closing, such additional acts (including, without limitation, executing and delivering additional documents) as are reasonably required to effect more fully the transactions contemplated by this section 3.6. 3.7 conditions to permitted transfers; continued applicability of agreement. as a condition to any transfer permitted under this agreement, any transferee (other than any transferee that is then a party or pursuant to section 3.6) of common stock or common stock equivalents shall be required to become a party to this agreement, by executing an adoption agreement in substantially the form of exhibit b hereto, and shall have all the obligations of a party hereunder and the rights that are expressly provided for herein. if any person acquires common stock or common stock equivalents from a party in a transfer notwithstanding such person's failure to execute an adoption agreement in accordance with the preceding sentence (whether such transfer resulted by operation of law or otherwise), such person and such common stock or common stock equivalents shall be subject to this agreement, even if such person is not a party. 3.8 transfers subject to compliance with securities act and regulatory compliance. (a) no common stock or common stock equivalents may be transferred by a party (other than pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act) unless such party first delivers to the company an opinion of counsel, which opinion of counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the company, to the effect that such transfer is not required to be registered under the securities act; provided, however, that the company may waive this requirement. (b) each party agrees that prior to any transfer of common stock or common stock equivalents, and prior to any change of control of such party or any affiliate of such party who, directly or indirectly, controls such party, such party will, and will cause its respective affiliates and any person who will be the successor person in any such change of control to, make all required filings and obtain all required governmental approvals if the failure to obtain any such governmental approval would have any adverse effect on the company or its affiliates that the company controls. 3.9 transfer and exchange. when common stock or common stock equivalents are presented to the company with a request to register the transfer of such common stock or common stock equivalents or to exchange such common stock or common stock equivalents for common stock or common stock equivalents of other authorized denominations, the company shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if the requirements of this agreement for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the common stock or common stock equivalents surrendered for transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the company, duly executed by the holder thereof or its attorney and duly authorized in writing. no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental costs payable in connection therewith. the company may refuse to register a transfer of common stock or common stock equivalents on the transfer records of the company if such proposed transfer would constitute a violation of this agreement. the company may also give related instructions to its stock transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of any such securities. 3.10 restrictive legends. (a) except as otherwise provided in section 3.11 hereof, each certificate representing a share of common stock or common stock equivalent held by a party, and each certificate representing a share of common stock or common stock equivalent issued to any subsequent transferee, shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form: the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws. such securities may not be offered for sale, sold, pledged, transferred, or otherwise disposed of until the holder hereof provides evidence satisfactory to the issuer (which, in the discretion of the issuer, may include an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the issuer) that such offer, sale, pledge, transfer, or other disposition will not violate applicable federal or state securities laws. (b) each certificate representing a share of common stock or common stock equivalent issued to each party or a subsequent transferee shall include a legend in substantially the following form: this security is subject to restrictions on transfer, voting and other terms and conditions set forth in the stockholders agreement dated as of january 6, 2000, a copy of which may be obtained from the company at its principal executive offices. 3.11 termination of certain restrictions. notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.10, (a) the restrictive legends required by section 3.10(a) shall terminate as to any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents (i) when and so long as such shares of common stock or common stock equivalents shall have been effectively registered under the securities act and disposed of pursuant thereto or disposed of pursuant to the provisions of rule 144 promulgated under the securities act or (ii) when the company shall have received an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to it that such shares of common stock or common stock equivalents may be transferred without registration thereof under the securities act and that such legend may be removed, and (b) the restrictive legends required by section 3.10(b) shall terminate as to any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents upon an initial public offering. whenever the restrictions described in the legends set forth in section 3.10(a) or (b), as applicable, shall terminate as to any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from the company, at the company's expense, a new certificate representing such common stock or common stock equivalents not bearing such restrictive legend. 3.12 certain repurchase rights in lieu of registration rights. (a) in the event that an investor group demand holder makes a demand request (each as defined in exhibit a hereto) after the second anniversary hereof but prior to an initial public offering, then ees shall have the right, which it may exercise by giving written notice to such investor group demand holder (the "demand holder") and the company within ten (10) days following receipt of such demand request, to elect to have the fair market value of the shares covered by such request (the "demand request shares") determined as set forth below (an "appraisal notice"). upon receipt of an appraisal notice, the investor group holder and ees shall have fifteen (15)-days to attempt to agree upon the value of the shares covered by such demand request. if the investor group holder and ees cannot agree, the company, as soon as practicable following such fifteen (15)-day period after receipt of an appraisal notice (or earlier upon notice of the parties that they cannot agree on the value), will cause the fair market value of the demand request shares to be determined by an independent qualified appraiser (i.e., an appraiser that is unaffiliated with any of the investor group demand holders, ees or the company and who has at least five years experience in appraising equity securities of privately held companies) selected by the special committee and reasonably acceptable to ees and the investor group holder (such appraisal being herein referred to as the "appraisal" and the fair market value of the demand request shares determined by such appraisal or by mutual agreement being referred to herein as the "appraised value"). in conducting any appraisal, the appraiser shall, in accordance with customary investment banking practice, determine the price at which the demand request shares would most likely be able to be sold to the public in an initial public offering of such shares, assuming such shares are being sold in a firm commitment offering of reasonable size and liquidity for an entity of the company's size (such price to be determined as the mid-point of the range of the public offering price that would ordinarily be set forth in a preliminary prospectus relating to an initial public offering of shares of common stock). the company shall furnish a copy of the appraisal to ees and the demand holder. the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the appraisal completed within thirty (30) days following its receipt of the appraisal notice. (b) following its receipt of the appraisal or agreement as to the appraised value, ees shall have fifteen (15) days to give written notice (a "purchase offer") to the demand holder that ees is willing to purchase the demand request shares for the appraised value. if ees fails to give a purchase offer, then such demand holder's demand request shall be honored by the company in accordance with exhibit a hereto and ees shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the appraisal. if ees makes a purchase offer, the demand holder shall have fifteen (15) days to accept ees's purchase offer by giving written notice (an "acceptance") to ees that the demand holder accepts ees's purchase offer. if the demand holder fails to give an acceptance, then such demand holder's demand request shall be deemed revoked but shall not count as a demand request for the purpose of determining the number of demand requests the demand holder may make, provided that the demand holder shall not be permitted to make another demand request prior to the initial public offering and the demand holder shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the appraisal. if the demand holder does give an acceptance, then ees shall purchase the demand request shares in accordance with section 3.12(c), the demand request shall be deemed revoked and the company shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the appraisal. (c) the closing of the purchase of any demand request shares at the appraised value will take place at the offices of the company in houston, texas on the fifth business day after ees' receipt of the acceptance, unless otherwise agreed by the demand holder and ees; provided, however, that any such closing shall be delayed, to the extent required, until two (2) business days following the expiration of any required waiting periods under the hsr act and fpa, and the obtaining of all other governmental approvals deemed reasonably necessary by the demand holder or ees. at the closing, ees will pay the appraised value for the demand request shares in cash (by wire transfer) solely upon the demand holder's delivery to ees of valid certificates evidencing all of the demand request shares then being purchased. certificates or instruments representing such demand request shares will be duly endorsed (with signature guaranteed) for delivery to ees. in connection with the delivery of such certificates or agreements to ees, the demand holder will execute such written evidence as ees may reasonably request to represent and warrant to ees that the demand request shares are owned by such demand holder free and clear of all liens, adverse claims, and other encumbrances other than as provided in this agreement. the demand holder will promptly perform, whether before or after any such closing, such additional acts (including, without limitation, executing and delivering additional documents) as are reasonably required by ees to effect more fully the sale of any demand request shares as provided by this section 3.12. (d) the rights of ees under this section 3.12 with respect to any demand request shares may be transferred in whole, but not in part, by ees, without any consent or other action on the part of any other party hereto, to any ees group holder or to an affiliate of any ees group holder. 3.13 control of ees. ees agrees that, until the earlier of (i) three years from the date of this agreement, or (ii) termination of the noncompetition agreement entered into on or about the date hereof among enron, ees and the company, ees will take such action as shall be necessary so that enron will not sell or otherwise transfer any of its interest in ees if, after giving effect to such sale or transfer, enron would own, directly or indirectly, less than a majority economic and voting interest in ees, unless prior to such sale or transfer, ees distributes or otherwise transfers to enron or one or more of its affiliates a number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents that represent enron's direct or indirect proportionate economic interest in the shares of common stock and common stock equivalents then held by ees, if any, such that enron's direct or indirect proportionate economic ownership in the outstanding common stock or common stock equivalents is not reduced by reason of such sale or transfer. article iv registration of stock 4.1 registration rights. the company hereby grants to each party the applicable registration rights with respect to its common stock set forth in exhibit a hereto (and such exhibit a is incorporated herein by reference). article v certain covenants 5.1 financial statements and other information. the company covenants that, until the consummation of an initial public offering, it will deliver to each party: (a) as soon as practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) days after the end of each calendar month, a report showing in reasonable detail the financial and operating performance and results for the prior calendar month;

(d) as soon as practicable, and in any event within the applicable time period specified in the instructions to form 8-k under the securities exchange act of 1934, notice of any event that would be required to be reported on such form if the company were then required to file such reports; and (e) such other data and information as from time to time may be reasonably requested by any initial party who is then a party. 5.2 books and records; inspection rights. the company will keep proper books of record and accounts in which full, true and correct entries in conformity with gaap shall be made of all dealings and transactions in relation to its business and activities. the company will provide each initial party who is then a party during normal business hours after receipt of prior written notice with (i) reasonable access to the properties, books, records and contracts of the company and information relating to the company, its operations, properties, financial condition and affairs, and (ii) the opportunity to consult with management of the company from time to time regarding the company, its operations, properties, financial condition and affairs. 5.3 regulatory matters. ees and the company have advised the parties that after the date hereof, the company will make applications to various federal, state and local governmental and regulatory authorities necessary to conduct the company's business which may include, without limitation, applications for licenses and/or marketing certificates with state public utility commissions and the federal energy regulatory commission. the company agrees to provide to each party, within a reasonable period prior to the filing of any such applications, written notice of any requirements that to the company's knowledge are or will be required by a party to provide notices or otherwise take any actions under applicable laws as a result of the company's applications. each party agrees that it will, in conjunction with any such applications made by the company with federal, state and local governmental and regulatory authorities, comply with applicable laws imposed on such parties in connection with the foregoing company applications. 5.4 media investments. the company may not, directly or through one of its affiliates, make a media investment unless it gives each party reasonable advance notice of its desire to make such media investment and, prior to the consummation of such media investment and to the extent reasonably requested by any party, implements such arrangements as may be reasonably necessary to insulate such party from the applicability of any multiple ownership rules or other restrictions or limitations promulgated by the fcc that would be triggered as a result of the consummation of such media investment by the company or such affiliate. article vi termination 6.1 termination. the provisions of article ii (other than sections 2.3 and 2.5), sections 3.1 through 3.7, section 3.8(a), section 3.12, section 3.13 and article v of this agreement shall terminate in respect of all parties upon the earlier of (a) consummation of an initial public offering;

(a) request for registration. (i) from and after the earlier to occur of (a) the second anniversary of the date of the agreement or (b) six months following an initial public offering, any ees group demand holder or any investor group demand holder may make a written request of the company (a "demand request") to have the company effect a registration under the securities act (a "demand registration") for the sale of all or part of its registrable securities. prior to an initial public offering, a copy of the demand request shall also be given to ees for purposes of section 3.12 of the agreement. following receipt of such demand request, the company shall be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such demand registration subject to the terms hereof and subject to section 3.12 of the agreement; provided that the registrable securities proposed to be offered by the requesting holders must have a reasonably anticipated aggregate offering price of at least $50,000,000 net of underwriting discounts and commissions; and provided further that (i) the ees group demand holders shall be entitled to make no more than three demand requests pursuant to the foregoing provisions, provided that the company shall not be obligated to effect more than one demand registration at the request of any of the ees group demand holders in any six-month period, and (ii) each investor group demand holder shall be entitled to make only one demand request pursuant to the foregoing provisions, provided that the company shall not be obligated to effect more than one demand registration at the request of any of the investor group demand holders in any six-month period. (ii) each demand request shall specify the number of shares of registrable securities proposed to be sold. subject to section 4(c), the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file under the securities act a registration statement on an appropriate form to effect the demand registration within 30 days after receiving a demand request (or if an initial public offering has not occurred, within 60 days after it has been determined in accordance with section 3.12 of the agreement that such demand request will not be revoked) (as applicable, the "required filing date") and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to be declared effective by the sec as promptly as practicable after such filing. (b) effective registration and expenses. a registration will not count as a demand registration until it has become effective (unless the requesting holders withdraw their demand request, in which case such demand will count as a demand registration unless (i) the requesting holders pay all registration expenses in connection with such withdrawn registration, or (ii) the company has not complied in all material respects with its obligations hereunder), provided that if, after it has become effective, an offering of registrable securities pursuant to a registration is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the sec or other governmental agency or court, such registration will be deemed not to have been effected. notwithstanding the foregoing, an investor group demand holder who makes a demand request shall be entitled to make one additional demand request if, in connection with the first demand request made by such investor group holder only, the number of registrable securities of such investor group demand holder included in such registration after giving effect to the provisions of paragraph (d) below is less than one-third (1/3) of the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration pursuant to its demand request. (c) selection of underwriters. the offering of registrable securities pursuant to a demand registration shall be in the form of a "firm commitment" underwritten offering. the company shall select the managing underwriter for any demand registration, provided that such underwriter is reasonably acceptable to the holders of a majority of the shares of registrable securities to be registered in a demand registration (the "majority requesting holders"). (d) priority on demand registrations. no securities to be sold for the account of any person (including the company) other than a requesting holder shall be included in a demand registration if the managing underwriter or underwriters shall advise the requesting holders in writing that the inclusion of such securities will materially and adversely affect the price or success of the offering (a "material adverse effect"); provided, however, that for purposes of the foregoing, with respect to a demand request made by an investor group demand holder, all other investor group holders who desire to participate in such demand registration shall be deemed to be requesting holders for all purposes other than determining the number of demand requests made by such investor group holders and with respect to a demand request made by an ees group demand holder, all other ees group holders who desire to participate in such demand registration shall be deemed to be requesting holders for all purposes other than determining the number of demand requests made by such ees group holders. furthermore, in the event the managing underwriter or underwriters shall advise the requesting holders that even after exclusion of all securities of other persons pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the amount of registrable securities proposed to be included in such demand registration by requesting holders is sufficiently large to cause a material adverse effect, the registrable securities of requesting holders to be included in such demand registration shall be allocated pro rata among the requesting holders on the basis of the number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such registration by each such requesting holder. (e) multiple demands. if the company shall receive, within a period of 15 days, a request to file a registration statement from more than one person who has the contractual right (whether exercisable alone or in conjunction with other rights) to require the company to file a registration statement (whether or not such person is a demand holder), only the first such person requesting the company to file a registration statement shall be considered a requesting holder for the purposes of determining the number of demand requests that may be made by such person pursuant to this section 2, and all other persons making such requests shall be considered a requesting holder for all purposes other than determining the number of demand requests made by such person. in the event the company shall receive a request to file a demand registration statement from any person (including a demand holder) who has the contractual right to cause the company to do so, the company shall promptly (and in any event within five days after its receipt of such request) notify all demand holders thereof. 3. piggy-back registration. (a) if the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering of any shares of common stock by the company for its own account (other than an initial public offering) or for the account of any holder of common stock or common stock equivalents (including any holder) (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 or any substitute form that may be adopted by the sec or any registration statement filed in connection with an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the company's existing security holders), then the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of the registrable securities as soon as practicable (but in no event less than 15 days before the anticipated filing date of such registration statement), and such notice shall offer such holders the opportunity to register such number of registrable securities as each such holder may request (a "piggyback registration"). subject to section 3(b) hereof, the company shall include in each such piggyback registration all registrable securities requested to be included in the registration for such offering by written notice to the company within 15 days of delivery of the company's notice referred to above. each holder of registrable securities shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of such holder's registrable securities from a piggyback registration at any time prior to the effective date thereof. (b) the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit the registrable securities requested to be included in the registration statement for such offering under section 3(a) or pursuant to other piggyback registration rights granted by the company ("piggyback securities"), to be included on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities included therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not be required to include any holder's piggyback securities in such offering unless such holder accepts the terms of the underwriting agreement between the company and the managing underwriter or underwriters and otherwise complies with the provisions of section 8 below. if the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering advise the company that in their opinion the total amount of securities, including piggyback securities, to be included in such offering is sufficiently large to cause a material adverse effect, then in such event the securities to be included in such offering shall be allocated first to the requesting holders if such registration statement is pursuant to a demand request or, if not, then the company, and then, to the extent that any additional securities can, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, be sold without any such material adverse effect, pro rata among the holders of piggyback securities on the basis of the number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such registration by each such holder. 4. holdback agreements. (a) restrictions on public sale by holder of registrable securities. following any underwritten public offering of equity securities by the company or any holder of registrable securities effected pursuant to this agreement, each holder of registrable securities that owns, together with its affiliates (or in the case of calpers and otp, together with each other and each of their respective affiliates (except with respect to either of the foregoing who owns less than 1% of the outstanding common stock)), 5% or more of the then outstanding shares of common stock taking into account all shares of common stock acquirable pursuant to common stock equivalents owned by such holder and its affiliates (whether or not such registrable securities are included in such offering) and each holder of registrable securities that owns, together with its affiliates (or in the case of calpers and otp, together with each other and each of their respective affiliates), less than 5% of the then outstanding shares of common stock (if and only if such registrable securities are included in such offering), agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of the issue being registered or of any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, during the 5 days prior to, and during such period (up to 180 days) beginning on the date of the final prospectus used with respect to such offering hereto as shall be requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters except as part of such registration, and, if and to the extent requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters, each such holder of registrable securities agrees to execute an agreement to the foregoing effect with the underwriters for such offering on such terms as the managing underwriter or underwriters shall reasonably request. (b) restrictions on public sale by the company and others. following any underwritten public offering of equity securities by any holder of registrable securities effected pursuant to this agreement, the company agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of any securities similar to those being registered, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the 5 days prior to, and during such period (up to 180 days) beginning on date of the final prospectus used with respect to such offering hereto as shall be requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters except as part of such registration as permitted hereby. (c) deferral of filing. the company may defer the filing (but not the preparation) of a registration statement required by section 2 until a date not later than 60 days after the required filing date if (i) at the time the company receives the demand request, the company or its subsidiaries are engaged in confidential negotiations or other confidential business activities that would be material to the company, disclosure of which would be required in such registration statement (but would not be required if such registration statement were not filed), and the board determines in good faith that such disclosure would be materially detrimental to the company, or (ii) subject to section 2(e), the company had received, prior to receiving the demand request, a demand request from a different group of requesting holders (a "preferred request") and is proceeding with reasonable diligence to comply with the preferred request, or (iii) prior to receiving the demand request, the board had determined to effect a registered underwritten public offering of the company's equity securities for the company's account and the company had taken substantial steps (including, but not limited to, selecting or entering into a letter of intent with the managing underwriter for such offering) and is proceeding with reasonable diligence to effect such offering. a deferral of the filing of a registration statement pursuant to this section 4(c) shall be lifted, and the requested registration statement shall be filed forthwith, if, in the case of a deferral pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the negotiations or other activities are disclosed or terminated, or, in the case of a deferral pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the preferred request is withdrawn, or in the case of a deferral pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the proposed registration for the company's account is abandoned. in order to defer the filing of a registration statement pursuant to this section 4(c), the company shall promptly, upon determining to seek such deferral, deliver to each requesting holder a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the company stating that the company is deferring such filing pursuant to this section 4(c) and the basis therefor in reasonable detail. within 20 days after receiving such certificate, the holders of a majority of the registrable securities held by the requesting holders and for which registration was previously requested may withdraw such request by giving notice to the company; if withdrawn, the demand request shall be deemed not to have been made for all purposes of this agreement. the company may defer the filing of a demand registration pursuant to this section 4(c) only one time during any 12 month period. 5. registration procedures. whenever the holders have requested that any registrable securities be registered pursuant to section 2 hereof, the company will, at its expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration and the sale of such registrable securities under the securities act in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof prior to the required filing date, and in connection with any such request, the company will as expeditiously as practicable: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies or which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of the registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use commercially reasonable efforts and proceed diligently and in good faith to cause such filed registration statement to become effective under the securities act; provided that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the company will furnish to all selling holders and to one counsel reasonably acceptable to the company selected by the selling holders, copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review of such counsel; provided further that in connection with a demand registration, the company shall not file any registration statement or prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, if the requesting holders who hold a majority of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement or their counsel shall reasonably object on a timely basis; (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective pursuant to section 2 for a period (except as provided in the last paragraph of this section 5) of not less than 180 consecutive days or, if shorter, the period terminating when all registrable securities covered by such registration statement have been sold (but not before the expiration of the applicable period referred to in section 4(3) of the securities act and rule 174 thereunder, if applicable) and comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended method of disposition by the selling holders thereof set forth in such registration statement; (c) furnish to each such selling holder such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto), the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as such selling holder may reasonably request, including, but not limited to, the matters set forth in sections 5(a)(i), (ii), (iii) and (v), in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by such selling holder; (d) notify the selling holders promptly, and (if requested by any such person) confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective under the securities act and each applicable state law, (ii) of any request by the sec or any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a registration statement or related prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the sec of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) if at any time the representations or warranties of the company or any subsidiary contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) contemplated by section 5(i) below cease to be true and correct in any material respect, (v) of the receipt by the company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (vi) of the happening of any event which makes any statement made in such registration statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in such registration statement, prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the registration statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vii) of the company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a registration statement would be appropriate; (e) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment; (f) cooperate with the selling holders and the managing underwriter or underwriters to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing registrable securities to be sold, which certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends and shall be in a form eligible for deposit with the depositary trust company; (g) use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such registrable securities as promptly as practicable under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any selling holder or managing underwriter reasonably (in light of the intended plan of distribution) requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such selling holder or managing underwriter to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the registrable securities owned by such selling holder; provided that the company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (g), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

contribution. (a) indemnification by the company. the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each selling holder, each person, if any, who controls such selling holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, and the officers, directors, agents, general and limited partners, and employees of each selling holder and each such controlling person from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (joint or several), and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and attorneys' fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of, or are based upon and in conformity with, any such untrue statement or omission or allegation thereof based upon information furnished in writing to the company by such selling holder or on such selling holder's behalf expressly for use therein; provided, however, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense results from the fact that a current copy of the prospectus was not sent or given to the persons asserting any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities to such person if it is determined that (i) it was the responsibility of such selling holder or any underwriter or dealer for such selling holder to provide such person with a current copy of the prospectus, (ii) such selling holder was provided with a current copy of the prospectus prior to the written confirmation of sale and (iii) such current copy of the prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. the company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the selling holders provided in this section 7(a). (b) indemnification by holder of registrable securities. each selling holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each other selling holder, the company, and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act and the officers, directors, agents and employees of each other selling holder, the company and each such controlling person to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to such selling holder, but only with respect to information furnished in writing by such selling holder or on such selling holder's behalf expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities. the liability of any selling holder under this section 7(b) shall be limited to the aggregate cash and property received by such selling holder pursuant to the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement or prospectus. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnification under section 7(a) or 7(b) above (an "indemnified party") in respect of which indemnity may be sought from any person who has agreed to provide such indemnification under section 7(a) or 7(b) above (an "indemnifying party"), the indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and shall assume the payment of all reasonable expenses of such defense. such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the indemnifying party fails promptly to assume the defense of such action or proceeding or fails to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and indemnifying party (or an affiliate of the indemnifying party), and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or there is a conflict of interest on the part of counsel employed by the indemnifying party to represent such indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party). notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable at any time for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together in each case with appropriate local counsel). the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified party from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. the indemnifying party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect of such action or proceeding for which such indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 7 is unavailable to the indemnified parties in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to herein, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified parties, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified parties as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments as between the company on the one hand and each selling holder on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company and of each selling holder in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of each selling holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such person, and the person's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and the selling holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 7(d), no selling holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities of such selling holder were offered to the public (less any underwriting discounts or commissions) exceeds the amount of any damages which such selling holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason by such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8. participation in underwritten registrations. no holder may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such holder (a) agrees to sell such holder's registrable securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the person entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and this agreement. 9. transfers of registration rights. the provisions hereof will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the initial parties; provided, however, that the registration rights granted hereby may be transferred only (i) by operation of law, or (ii) to any person to whom a holder transfers registrable securities, provided that any such transferee shall not be entitled to rights pursuant to section 2 or 3 hereof unless such transferee of registration rights hereunder agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof and agrees to execute and deliver to the company an acknowledgment and agreement to such effect. 10. acknowledgement of certain other registration rights. the parties hereto agree that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, aol and its permitted assigns shall be entitled to the piggyback registration rights granted or to be granted pursuant to the that certain subscription agreement to be entered into on or about the date hereof pursuant to the terms of the interactive marketing agreement dated as of november 24, 1999 between the company and aol. exhibit b adoption agreement this adoption agreement ("adoption") is executed pursuant to the terms of the stockholders agreement of emw energy services corp.

(a) trust certificates shall, subject to applicable securities laws, be freely transferable by a holder to any other person or transferee, provided that until the former trust certificate is delivered to the trustee for cancellation and issuance of a new trust certificate in the name of the transferee, the transfer shall not be effective with respect to the trustee and the trustee shall not treat the transferee as a holder until a trust certificate is issued in such transferee's name. (b) except as provided in sections 8 and 10 and in subsections (i) and (ii) of this section 9(b), certificates (or the equivalent evidence of ownership in the case of share equivalents) for deposited shares may not be delivered by the trustee to a holder, a holder's designee or any other third party prior to the termination of the voting trust created herein.

certificate or certificates (or the equivalent evidence of ownership in the case of share equivalents) for deposited shares in which the requesting party holds a trust certificate hereunder; provided, however, that no such request shall be made if immediately after giving effect thereto either (a) dlj affiliates will own in the aggregate in excess of 5% in the aggregate of the total number of shares of the voting capital stock (of any class) of the corporation then outstanding or (b) dlj or any "group" (as defined in section 13d-5 under the exchange act and the rules and regulations

the rules and regulations promulgated under the securities act, and provided further if the requesting party is not dlj, the trustee shall not honor such request unless dlj consents in writing to such request. in determining, for purposes of this subsection (ii) only, whether dlj affiliates will own in the aggregate in excess of 5% in the aggregate of the total number of shares of the voting capital stock (of any class) of the corporation then outstanding, (x) no effect shall be given to the exclusions set forth in section 2(b), (y) shares of common stock underlying share equivalents owned by a dlj affiliate shall be deemed to be outstanding and owned by such dlj affiliate and (z) shares of common stock held by the trustee pursuant to this agreement shall be excluded. such written request (in relying on which the trustee shall be fully protected) shall contain the requesting party's agreement and representation that it will execute and deliver any agreement or other document required by the stockholders agreement, and shall name such requesting party and shall state (i) the proposed transfer date (which date shall be not less than five days after the trustee's receipt of such request) and (ii) the number and type of shares to be transferred. the written request to the trustee shall also be accompanied by (i) a trust certificate or certificates of the requesting party, duly endorsed for transfer, representing the beneficial interest in not less than the number of shares of the type to be transferred to the requesting party, (ii) a certificate of an officer of the requesting party and of dlj (in relying on which the trustee shall be fully protected) certifying that immediately after giving effect to such request dlj affiliates will own in the aggregate not more than 5% in the aggregate of the total number of shares of the voting capital stock (of any class) of the corporation then outstanding and (iii) an opinion of independent nationally recognized counsel who are experts in matters involving the federal securities law that, immediately after giving effect to such transfer, neither dlj nor any "group" (as defined in section 13d-5 under the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of which dlj is a member will be the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation's common stock or an "affiliate" of the corporation within the meaning of rule 144 of the rules and regulations promulgated under the securities act. on the date specified in such request, and upon receipt by the trustee from the requesting party of such certificates, the trustee shall deliver to the requesting party a certificate (or the equivalent evidence of ownership in the case of share equivalents) for the number of shares of the type specified in such notice, issued in the name of the trustee and duly endorsed for transfer. 10. exercise, conversion, exchange or cancellation of shares. the trustee shall, upon written instruction of a holder, submit to the corporation for exercise, conversion, exchange or cancellation such number of shares as correspond to the number of shares specified in such holder's trust certificate (or such lesser number as may be specified in such instruction). such instruction shall state (a) whether such shares are to be exercised, converted, exchanged or canceled, and the basis for such action, (b) the date on which a certificate or certificates representing such shares are to be submitted to the corporation (which date shall not be less than five days after the trustee's receipt of such instruction), (c) the number and type of shares to be submitted to the corporation and (d) the consideration, if any, to be received upon such exercise, conversion, exchange or cancellation from the corporation. the instruction (in relying on which the trustee shall be fully protected) shall be accompanied by (x) a trust certificate or certificates of the holder, duly endorsed for transfer, representing not less than the number of shares of the type to be submitted to the corporation and (y) any exercise price or other payment and any agreement, certificate or other documentation required in connection with such exercise, conversion, exchange or cancellation. on the date specified in such instruction, and against receipt from the corporation of the specified consideration, if any, the trustee shall deliver: (i) to the corporation, (x) a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of the type specified in such instruction issued in the name of the trustee and duly endorsed for transfer and (y) any exercise price or other payment and any agreement, certificate or other documentation delivered to the trustee by such holder with such notice and (ii) to the holder, (x) a trust certificate representing the beneficial interest in a number of shares equal to the number of shares represented by the surrendered trust certificate or certificates less the number of shares submitted to the corporation and (y) upon receipt, the consideration, if any, received by the trustee pursuant to such exercise, conversion, exchange or cancellation; provided that if such consideration includes shares, such shares shall be held by the trustee pursuant to this agreement and new trust certificates representing the beneficial interest in such shares shall be issued to such holder. 11. increase or decrease in number of shares. if the number of outstanding shares is increased by virtue of a stock split or the decrease in the number of outstanding shares because of a contraction of shares or a change in the number of outstanding shares as a result of some other recapitalization in which the corporation receives no consideration for the issuance of the additional or reduced number of shares, the new additional or changed number of shares shall be held by the trustee under this agreement, the trust certificates outstanding immediately prior to such increase, decrease, or change in the number of outstanding shares shall thereupon represent the beneficial interest in the number of shares to which the holders are entitled as a result of such increase, decrease, or change, and new trust certificates evidencing the changed number of shares on deposit shall be issued to holders upon surrender of the then existing trust certificates. 12. successor trustee. there shall initially be one trustee of the voting trust created herein. upon the liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, suspension, incapacity, resignation or removal (in accordance with section 13 below) of the initial trustee, dlj or the holders of trust certificates representing the beneficial interest in 50% or more of the deposited shares shall appoint a successor trustee by written notice to the other parties hereto and the other holders; provided, however, that such successor trustee shall not be a control affiliate, an employee affiliate, or an other dlj affiliate. if a successor trustee shall not have been appointed within 30 days of such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, suspension, incapacity or removal, the trustee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint such a successor. if the trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all of substantially all of its corporate trust assets or another entity that is a bank or trust company, the resulting, surviving, or transferee entity shall become the successor trustee upon notice to the signatories hereto but without further action by the signatories or any holder. 13. removal/resignation of trustee. (a) a trustee may be removed by dlj or the holders of trust certificates representing the beneficial interest in 50% or more of the deposited shares by written notice to the other parties hereto and the other holders: (i) if it is determined as a result of binding arbitration pursuant to this section 13 that either (a) the trustee has willfully and materially violated the terms of this agreement, or (b) the trustee has been guilty of malfeasance, misfeasance or dereliction of duty hereunder; (ii) if the trustee shall have commenced a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to itself or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of it or any substantial part of its property, or shall have consented to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall have made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall have failed generally to pay its debts as they become due, or shall have taken any corporate action to authorize any of the foregoing; or (iii) if an involuntary case or other proceeding shall have been commenced against the trustee seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to it or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of it or any substantial part of its property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding shall have remained undismissed and unstayed for a period of 60 days; or an order for relief shall have been entered against the trustee under the federal bankruptcy laws as now or hereafter in effect.

connection with, or based upon this agreement or the actions or failures to act of the trustee hereunder or thereunder, except to the extent such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense is caused by or results from the trustee's malfeasance (as determined by a final and unappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction). dlj agrees on behalf of itself and the holders that it will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the trustee, as such and in its individual, capacity, and its directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against any indemnified claims. dlj's obligation hereunder

that the trustee shall be obligated to return any such portion of such reimbursement as may be subsequently determined by a final and unappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have

other interested party and shall give rise to no personal liability on the part of the trustee. the trustee shall not be personally liable in any event for acts or defaults of any other trustee or

require the trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. 20. certain calculations.
