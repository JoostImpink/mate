the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the company for such shelf registration statement or by the securities act or any rules and regulations thereunder; provided, however, that the company shall not be deemed to have used its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective during the applicable period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in the holders not being able to sell shelf registrable securities covered thereby during that period, unless such action is required under applicable law or the company has filed a post-effective amendment to the shelf registration statement and the commission has not declared it effective or except as otherwise permitted by the last six sentences of section 3.2(b). the holders will provide information reasonably requested by the company in connection with the shelf registration statement as promptly as practicable after receipt of such request. the "plan of distribution" section of the shelf registration statement shall permit negotiated purchases, secondary distributions, block trades, ordinary brokerage transactions or a combination of such methods of sale, provided, however, that the company's obligations under sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof shall not include participation in underwritten offerings or other organized

(ii) or (iii) in this section 3.2(b), section 3.2(d) or section 3.2(i) with respect to the shelf registrable securities (x) to the extent that (i) in the reasonable opinion of the company (a) securities laws applicable to such sale would require the company to disclose material non-public information ("non-public information") and (b) the disclosure of such non-public information would materially adversely affect the company; (ii) such sale would occur during the measurement period for determining the amount of common stock, or the amount of any other consideration the amount of which will be based on the price of the common stock, in connection with the acquisition of a business or assets by the company (a "measurement period"); or (iii) the company is contemplating an underwritten public offering of its securities and in the reasonable opinion of the underwriters such sale would interfere materially with such public offering by the company (a "financing period"); and the company delivers written notice to the holders to the effect that the holders may not make offers or sales under the shelf registration statement for a period not to exceed 45 days from the date of such notice; provided, however, that the company may deliver only four such notices under this section 3.2(b) and section 3.4(a) within any twelve-month period, provided, further, that the company may deliver only two such notices under this section 3.2(b) and section 3.4(a) within the twelve-month period immediately following the expiration of the six-month period referred to in section 3.3(f)(i) hereof and (y) unless and until the company has received a written notice (a "shelf registration notice") from any holder that such holder intends to make offers or sales under the shelf registration statement as specified in such shelf registration notice; provided, however, that the company shall have ten business days to prepare and file any such amendment or supplement after receipt of the shelf registration notice. the measurement period and financing period are collectively referred to herein as the "restricted period." in the event the sale by the holders of shelf registrable securities is deferred because of the existence of non-public information, the company will notify the holders promptly upon such non-public information being included by the company in a

company, the holders shall again be entitled to sell shelf registrable securities as provided herein. in the event the sale by the holders of shelf registrable securities is deferred because it is proposed to be made during a restricted period, the company shall specify, in notifying the holders of the deferral of its sale, when the restricted period will end, at which time the holders shall again be entitled to sell shelf registrable securities as provided herein. if the restricted period is thereafter changed, the company will promptly notify the holders of such change and upon the end

qualification effective during the period such shelf registration statement is required to be kept effective or during the period offers or sales are being made by the holders after a holder has delivered a shelf registration notice to the company, whichever is shorter; provided, however, that in connection therewith, the company shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation to do business or to register as a broker or dealer in any such jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify or register but for this section 3.2(d), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (iii) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction; v. notify the holders promptly and, if requested by a holder, confirm in writing, (i)

securities; ix. subject to the last six sentences of section 3.2(b) hereof, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by clause (v) of section 3.2(e) hereof, use its reasonable best efforts promptly to prepare and file an amendment or a supplement to the shelf prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or prepare, file and obtain effectiveness of a post-effective amendment to the shelf registration statement, or file any other required document, in any such case to the extent necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the shelf registrable

company's obligations with respect to the shelf registration statement pursuant to section 3.1 hereof and this section 3.2, the holders covenant and agree that (i) they will not offer or sell any shelf registrable securities under the shelf registration statement until a holder has provided a shelf registration notice pursuant to section 3.2(b) and have received copies of the shelf prospectus as then amended or supplemented as contemplated by section 3.2(c) and notice from the company that the shelf registration statement and any post-effective amendments thereto have become effective as contemplated by section 3.2(e); (ii) upon receipt of any notice from the company contemplated by section 3.2(b) or section 3.2(e) (in respect of the occurrence of an event contemplated therein), the

affiliates, if any, will enter into such written agreements as the company shall reasonably request to ensure compliance with clauses (iv) and (v) above. c. demand offerings. i. requests for demand offering. pggm, dihc or a holder or holders owning a majority of the demand offering securities (the "demand initiating holder") may request the offering under the securities act of all or any portion of the demand offering securities held by such holders for sale in the manner specified in such request, including an underwritten offering. upon receipt of such request, the company will promptly, but in any event within 20 days, give written notice of such requested registration to all holders of demand offering securities, and thereupon, in accordance with section 3.4 hereof, the company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and sale of: (1) the demand offering securities which the company has been so requested to register by such demand initiating holder; (2) all other demand offering securities which the company has been requested to register by the other holders thereof by written request delivered to the company within 15 days after the giving of such written notice by the company, and (3) all shares of common stock which the company may elect to register for its own account or for the account of others in connection with the offering of demand

only when all such demand offering securities shall have been sold pursuant thereto; provided, however, that if a demand prospectus filed by the company pursuant to a demand offering request shall be abandoned or withdrawn at the behest of the demand initiating holder, then, unless the holders shall, promptly upon receipt of a request by the company therefor supported by an invoice setting forth the expenses in reasonable detail, reimburse the company for the demand offering expenses in respect of such prospectus attributable to the holders, the company shall be deemed to have effected a demand offering. iii. minimum offering amount. the company shall not be required to comply with this section 3.3 unless the aggregate current market price of all demand offering securities covered by the demand offering request and the demand offering securities described in section 3.3(a)(ii) shall be $75 million or more (unless and to the extent the demand initiating holder shall hold less than $75 million of demand offering securities, in which case such minimum offering amount shall be equal to the amount of demand offering securities so held). iv. selection of underwriters. if the method of disposition specified by pggm shall be an underwritten public offering, the company may designate the managing underwriter of such offering, subject to the approval of the demand initiating holder which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. v. priority on demand offerings. the company shall be entitled to include in any offering referred to in this section 3.3, for sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified by the demand initiating holder shares of common stock to be sold by the company for its own account or by other shareholders of the company for their account. nonetheless, whether or not the company desires to include any such additional shares in a demand offering, if the managing underwriters advise the company in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the maximum number which can be included in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (the "maximum number"), then the company will limit the number of shares included in such offering to the maximum number, and the shares offered shall be selected in the following order of priority: (i) first,

(b) shall not be reduced to less than one-third of the total number of shares in such offering, and (iv) fourth, other securities requested to be included in such registration. vi. exception. anything in this section 3.3 to the contrary notwithstanding, the company shall not be required to file a demand prospectus in connection with a demand offering (i) within six months after the closing date of a demand offering or the effective date of any registration statement (other than pursuant to section 3.1 or a registration statement on form s-8 with respect to an employee benefit plan or a registration statement on form s-4 relating to securities to be issued in a merger or in exchange for securities or assets of another person) of the company or (ii) if counsel for the company, reasonably acceptable to the demand initiating holder shall deliver an opinion to the holders to the effect that, pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act or otherwise, the holders can publicly offer and sell the demand offering securities as to which sale has been requested without registration under the securities act. d. demand offering procedures. if and whenever the company is required by the provisions of section 3.3 hereof to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the sale of any of the demand offering securities under the securities act, the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and sale of the demand offering securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof and will, as expeditiously as possible: i. within 45 days after receiving a request for a demand offering, prepare and file with the commission a demand prospectus as a supplement to the shelf registration statement with respect to such demand offering securities. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the filing of such demand prospectus may be delayed for a period not to exceed 45 days if (i) any of the events specified in clause (x) of section 3.2(b) hereof shall have occurred, or (ii) the company is engaged in any program for the repurchase of common stock or other securities of the company and the company provides written notice to the demand initiating holder; provided, however, that the company may deliver only four notices under this section 3.4(a) and 3.2(b) hereof within any twelve-month period; provided, further, that the company may deliver only two such notices under this section 3.4(a) and section 3.2(b) within the twelve-month period immediately following the expiration of the six-month period

requested by the holders, confirm in writing, (i) when the demand prospectus has been filed with the commission, (ii) when any amendment or supplement to the demand prospectus has been filed with the

demand prospectus for such period; vii. furnish to the holders and to each underwriter such number of copies of the shelf registration statement and the demand prospectus included therein (including

related demand prospectus, and each amendment or supplement thereto, comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the securities act and the applicable rules and regulations of the commission thereunder and that such counsel does not believe that any such shelf registration statement, demand prospectus, amendment or supplement contains a misstatement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no opinion as to financial statements or financial or statistical data contained therein) and (c) to such other effects as may reasonably be requested by counsel for the underwriters or by the holders or their counsel, and (ii) a "cold comfort" letter dated such date from the independent public accountants retained by the company, addressed to the underwriters,

such underwriters for comparable transactions that the company keep a registration statement effective to permit each underwriter to complete the distribution of all securities purchased by it, and the period of distribution of demand offering securities in any other registration shall be deemed to extend until the earlier of the sale of all demand offering securities covered thereby or nine months after the effective date thereof. in connection with each registration hereunder, each holder will furnish to the company in writing such information with respect to itself and the proposed distribution by itself as shall be reasonably necessary in order to assure compliance with federal and applicable state securities laws. reasonable compliance with the obligation to furnish such information shall be a condition to the rights afforded such holder hereunder. in addition, each holder and any of its partners, officers, directors or affiliates, if any, (i) will comply with the

offering expenses. in connection with any demand offering, the company shall pay all demand offering expenses and the holders shall pay all selling expenses applicable to the shares sold by the holders. f. piggyback registrations. i. right to piggyback. in the event that a holder is not permitted to effect sales under the shelf registration statement under section 3.2(b)(x)(iii) hereof or the holders are not permitted to effect demand offering due to section 3.4(a)(i), holders shall become entitled to the rights of this section 3.6. the company will promptly (but in any event within 30 days) give written notice to the holders of its intention to effect such registration and a description of any underwriting agreement to be entered into with respect thereto and will include in such registration all shelf registrable securities or demand offering securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion within 15 days after the receipt of the company's notice (a "piggyback registration request"); provided, however, that the company shall not be required to include shelf registrable securities or demand offering securities in the securities to be registered pursuant to a registration statement on any form which limits the amount of securities which may be registered by the issuer and/or selling security holders if, and to the extent that, such inclusion would make the use of such form unavailable. in the event that any piggyback registration shall be, in whole or in part, an underwritten public offering of common stock, the holders shall agree that such demand offering securities or shelf registrable securities are to be included in the underwriting on the same terms and conditions as the shares of common stock otherwise being sold through underwriters under such registration. ii. priority on primary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the company, and the managing underwriters advise the company in writing that in their opinion the number of shares requested to be included in such registration exceeds the maximum number, the company will limit the

sell, subject to the proviso set forth in clause (ii) below, (ii) second, (a) shelf registrable securities or demand offering securities covered by piggyback registration requests, and (b) securities requested to be included in such registration pursuant to (x) the stockholders' agreement, dated as of november 22, 1996, by and among the company and the new york state teachers' retirement system and (y) the stockholders' agreement, dated as of november 7, 1996, by and between the company and hexalon real estate, inc., pro rata among the holders thereof on the basis of the number of shares requested to be included in such registration; provided that the securities requested to be included pursuant to clauses (x) and (y) shall not be reduced to less than one-third of the total number of shares in such offering and (iii) third, other securities requested to be included in such registration. iii. priority on secondary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the company's securities, and the managing underwriters advise the company in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the maximum number, the company will include in such registration the shares requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration and the shelf registrable securities and demand offering securities covered by piggyback registration requests and any other securities requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among the holders thereof on the basis of the number of shares requested to be included in such registration; provided, however, that if the holders requesting registration are doing so pursuant to demand registration rights of such holders, such holders' shares shall take priority over any shelf registrable securities and demand offering securities and any other securities requested to be included, which shall be included on a pro rata basis, subject to the proviso set forth in section 3.6(b)(ii)(b). g. indemnification. i. indemnification by the company. to the extent permitted by law, the company shall indemnify and hold harmless the seller of any shares covered by any registration statement filed pursuant to section 3, its directors, trustees and officers, each other person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, joint or several, to which such seller or any such director, trustee or officer or participating or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or related actions or proceedings) arise out of or are based upon (x) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in such registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to such registration statement, or any document incorporated by reference in such registration statement, or (y) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the company will reimburse such seller, and each such director, trustee, officer, participating person and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding, provided that the company shall not be liable in any such case (1) to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument duly executed by such seller or any such director, trustee, officer, participating person or controlling person specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement or (2) to the extent any amount paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action of such settlement is effected without the written consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such seller or any such director, trustee, officer, participating person or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. the company shall agree to make provision for contribution relating to such indemnity as shall be reasonably requested by any seller of shares or the underwriters. ii. indemnification by the sellers. the company may require, as a condition to including any shares in any registration statement filed pursuant to section 3, that the company shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from each prospective seller of such securities, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 3.6(a)) the company, each director of the company, each officer of the company who shall sign such registration statement and each other person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, with respect to any untrue statement in or omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus included in such registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to such registration statement, of a material fact if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument duly executed by such seller specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. iii. indemnification procedure. promptly after receipt by any party entitled to indemnification pursuant to section 3.7(a) or 3.7(b) of this agreement (an "indemnified party") of notice by a third party of any complaint or the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, such indemnified party shall notify the party obligated to provide such indemnification (the "indemnifying party") of such complaint or of the commencement of such action or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from liability for such claim arising otherwise than under this agreement, and such failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party from liability which the indemnifying party may have hereunder with respect to such claim if, but only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to notify the indemnifying party results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of material rights and defenses otherwise available to the indemnifying party with respect to such claim. the indemnifying party shall have the right, upon written notice to the indemnified party, to assume the defense of such action or proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel. in the event, however, that the indemnifying party declines or fails to assume the defense of the action or proceeding or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, in either case in a timely manner, then such indemnified party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in any such action or proceeding and the indemnifying party shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all indemnified parties in any jurisdiction in any single action or proceeding. in any action or proceeding with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the indemnified party or the indemnifying party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in such litigation and to retain its own counsel at such party's own expense. the indemnifying party or the indemnified party, as the case may be, shall at all times use reasonable best efforts to keep the indemnifying party or the indemnified party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any action, the defense of which it is maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with the indemnifying party or the indemnified party, as the case may be, with respect to the defense of any such action. no indemnified party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the indemnifying party from all liability arising out of such claim. an indemnifying party may not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim and does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the indemnified party or any of the indemnified party's affiliates. in the event an indemnified party shall claim a right to payment pursuant to this agreement, such indemnified party shall send written notice of such claim to the appropriate indemnifying party. such notice shall specify the basis for such claim. as promptly as possible after the indemnified party has given such notice, such indemnified party and the appropriate indemnifying party shall establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement or otherwise) and, within five business days of the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the indemnifying party shall deliver to the indemnified party immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder. if for any reason the indemnification provided for in this section 3.7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated by this section 3.7, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided that in no event shall the liability of any holder for such contribution and indemnification exceed, in the aggregate, the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder upon the sale of shares giving rise to such indemnification and contribution obligations. the obligations of the parties under this section 3.7 shall be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise have to any other party. h. limitations on registration rights of others. the company represents and warrants that, except pursuant to this agreement and pursuant to rights granted pursuant to the agreements set forth on exhibit a hereto, it has not granted to any person the right to request or require the company to register any securities issued by the company. 4. rule 144. the company shall comply with the requirements of rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time (or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission), regarding the availability of current public information to the extent required to enable any holder of shares to sell shares without registration under the securities act pursuant to rule 144 (or any similar rule or regulation). upon the request of any holder of shares, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 5. amendments and waivers. this agreement may be amended and the company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the company shall have obtained the written consent to such amendment, action or omission to act, of the holder or holders of a majority of the shares (and, in the case of any amendment, action or omission to act which adversely affects any specific holder of shares or a specific group of holders of shares, the written consent of each such holder or holders of a majority of the shares held by such group). each holder of any shares at the time shall be bound by any consent authorized by this section 5. 6. nominees for beneficial owners. in the event that any shares are held by a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof, the beneficial owner thereof may, at its election, be treated as the holder of such shares for purposes of any request or other action by any holder or holders of shares pursuant to this agreement or any determination of any number or percentage of shares of shares held by any holder or holders of shares contemplated by this agreement. if the beneficial owner of any shares so elects, the company may require assurances reasonably satisfactory to it of such owner's beneficial ownership of such shares. 7. covenants of the parties. a. board of

(b) to the extent any purported transfer of shares by any u.s. person would cause a non-u.s. person to beneficially own shares of a class of stock of the corporation in excess of the non-u.s. ownership limit, those shares of the corporation as to which the non-u.s. person has most recently acquired beneficial ownership shall constitute "excess shares" under this article 9. excess shares shall have the following characteristics: (1) the holder of excess shares shall be deemed to have transferred those shares to the corporation as trustee (the "trustee") for the benefit of such person to whom such holder shall later transfer such shares provided that such shares shall not be excess shares in the hands of such person; (2) an interest in the trust holding such excess shares shall be freely transferable by the holder thereof at a price not in excess of the price paid by such holder for the excess shares; (3) holders of excess shares shall not be entitled to exercise any voting rights with respect to such excess shares; (4) excess shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of determining a quorum at the annual meeting or any special meeting of stockholders; (5) any dividends or other distributions with respect to excess shares which would have been payable in respect of shares of the corporation had they not constituted "excess shares" shall be accumulated by the trustee and deposited in a savings account in a new york bank (which may be the corporation's dividend disbursing agent) for the benefit of, and be payable to, the holder or holders of such shares of the corporation at such time as such excess shares shall cease to be excess shares; and (6) excess shares shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the corporation or its designee at their fair market value for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of (i) the transfer of stock which made the shares excess shares if the corporation has actual knowledge that such transfer creates excess shares as of the date of transfer or (ii) if such transfer is not actually known to the corporation, the determination by the board of directors in good faith by resolution duly adopted that a transfer creating excess shares has taken place. fair market value shall be determined as of the date of (i) or (ii) above, as appropriate, and shall be the closing price on the new york stock exchange or any other national stock exchange in the united states; but if the shares are not listed on the new york stock exchange or any other national stock exchange in the united states, then the closing price on the frankfurt, luxembourg, or dusseldorf stock exchanges; but if the shares are not listed on the frankfurt, luxembourg, or dusseldorf stock exchanges, then the bid price in the over-the-counter market; but if the shares are not traded in the over-the-counter market, then the price determined in good faith by the board of directors.

(d) if the board of directors shall at any time determine in good faith, by resolution duly adopted, that a transfer has taken place in violation of section 9.01(a), the board of directors may, but shall not be obligated to, take such action as it deems advisable to prevent or refuse to give effect to such transfer, including, but not limited to, refusing to give effect to such transfer on the books of the corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin such transfer. (e) any non-u.s. person to whom a transfer of shares is made in violation of section 9.01(a) is obliged immediately to give or cause to be given written notice thereof to the corporation and such other information as the corporation may reasonably require of such non-u.s. person relating to such person's status as a non-u.s. person and the shares beneficially owned or purported to be beneficially owned by such non-u.s. person.
