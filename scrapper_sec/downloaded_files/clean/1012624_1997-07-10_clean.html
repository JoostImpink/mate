(b) under no circumstances will interest be paid by the company or the partnership by reason of any delay in making such issuance or delivery of shares of common stock as a result of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph. (c) the partnership, effective as of the settlement date with respect to any partnership units tendered to and acquired by the partnership, assumes all obligations related to the tendered partnership units arising from and after the applicable settlement date and will hold the person tendering those partnership units harmless from any such obligations other than with respect to any breach of any representation contained in the letter of transmittal to be delivered in connection with the exercise of rights pursuant to this agreement. 4. procedure for tendering partnership units.

(c) the tender of partnership units pursuant to the foregoing will constitute a binding agreement between the tendering offeree and the partnership upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement and will not be subject to withdrawal or change. (d) all questions as to the validity and form of any tender of partnership units will be determined in the sole discretion of the partnership, which determination shall be final and binding. 5. rights as a partner. until the settlement date, each tendering offeree shall continue to own its respective tendered partnership units, and will continue to be treated as the holder of such tendered partnership units for all purposes of the partnership agreement, including, without limitation, for purposes of voting, consent, allocations and distributions (subject only to reasonable accounting conventions adopted by the partnership for purposes of determining the partners' varying percentage interests in the partnership during the taxable year). tendered partnership units will be transferred to the partnership only upon receipt by the tendering offeree of common stock in payment in full therefor. 6. cash options. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to the contrary, with regard to any partnership units properly tendered by an offeree, if such offeree advises either the partnership or the company that such offeree intends within 30 days thereafter to exercise any of its registration rights under the registration rights agreement, then at the sole and absolute discretion of the partnership, part or all of such partnership units may be redeemed by the partnership (or one or more of its affiliates) in exchange for cash (in amounts as set forth below), otherwise pursuant to the terms of this agreement. the amount of cash paid for such partnership units will be equal to the fair market value of the common stock which the offeree would have received had such partnership units been tendered in exchange for shares of common stock. 7. right to set off. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the contribution agreement, the registration rights agreement or any other agreement relating thereto, the partnership will have the absolute right to set off against amounts owed to the offerees (whether cash or shares of common 7 8 stock) for any amounts owed by any of the offerees to the partnership, the company or to their affiliates. 8. miscellaneous.

(d) if for any reason the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable to an indemnified person or is insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated hereby, then the indemnifying person shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified person as a result of such loss, cost, expense, claim, damage, liability, action or judgment in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnified person and the indemnifying person, but also the relative fault of the indemnified person and the indemnifying person as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. 6. lock-up. provision. each shareholder agrees in connection with any public offering of the company's securities following the date hereof that, upon the request of

(c) any claim by an indemnitee on account of an indemnifiable loss which does not result from a third party claim (a "direct claim") will be asserted by giving the indemnifying party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 15 calendar days after the indemnitee becomes aware of such direct claim, and the indemnifying party will have a period of 15 calendar days within which to respond in writing to such direct claim. if the indemnifying party does not so 51 55 respond within such 15 calendar day period, the indemnifying party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the indemnitee will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the indemnitee on the terms and subject to the provisions of this article v. (d) a failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information in any notice as provided in sections 5.2(a) or 5.2(b) will not affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder except and only to the extent that such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights or obligations of the indemnifying party. vi. miscellaneous provisions 6.1. notices. all notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder will be in writing and, unless otherwise provided in this agreement, will be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person or when dispatched by telegram or electronic facsimile transfer (confirmed in writing by mail simultaneously dispatched) or one business day after having been dispatched by a nationally recognized overnight courier service to the appropriate party at the address specified below: (a) if to crossroads and the partnership, to: interstate hotels corporation foster plaza ten, 680 andersen drive pittsburgh, pa 15220-8216 52 56 facsimile: 412-937-3265 attention: kevin p. kilkeary with a copy to: interstate hotels corporation foster plaza ten, 680 andersen drive pittsburgh, pennsylvania 15220-8216 facsimile: 412-937-3116 attention: marvin i. droz, esquire, vice president and general counsel (b) if to companies or mcneill, to: 4735 spottswood #102 memphis, tn 38117 facsimile: 901-761-3945 attention: mr. phillip h. mcneill, sr. with a copy to: bogatin law firm 860 ridge lake blvd., suite 360 memphis, tn 38120 facsimile: 901-767-1234 attention: patrick g. arnoult, esq. or to such other address or addresses as any such party may from time to time designate as to itself by like notice. 6.2. successors and assigns. this agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but will not be assignable or delegable by any party without the prior written consent of the other party. 6.3. waiver. crossroads and the partnership on the one hand, and mcneill and companies on the other hand, by written notice to the other may (a) extend the time for performance of 53 57 any of the obligations or other actions of the other under this agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of the other contained in this agreement, (c) waive compliance with any of the conditions or covenants of the other contained in this agreement, or (d) waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of the other under this agreement;
