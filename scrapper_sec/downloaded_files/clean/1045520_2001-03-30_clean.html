corporate square, atlanta, georgia 30329-2010. item 2. identity and background. this statement is being filed by canadian imperial bank of commerce ("cibc"), a bank governed by the bank act (canada). cibc's principal executive office is located at commerce court, toronto, ontario, canada m5l 1a2. cibc is a financial institution that provides a wide range of services to individuals, corporations and governments throughout canada and internationally, including commercial banking, investment advisory, mutual fund, broker/dealer and trust services. to the best knowledge of cibc as of the date

item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. on november 9, 2000, cibc and gpi, directly and indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an asset purchase agreement and

the control of gpi. cibc intends to review and evaluate its investment in gpi from time to time. upon the basis of such review and evaluation, as well as general economic and industry conditions existing at the time, and subject to the terms of certain restrictive agreements described in item 6 below, cibc may acquire additional shares of gpi common stock from time to time in market transactions or otherwise or may dispose of some or all of its holdings of gpi common stock from time to time in market transactions or otherwise. other than as described above, cibc has no current plans or proposals that relate to or would result in (i) the acquisition or disposition of gpi common stock; (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving gpi or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of gpi or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) any change in the present board of directors or management of gpi, including any current plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board of directors of gpi; (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of gpi; (vi) any other material change in gpi's business or corporate structure; (vii) any changes in gpi's charter, by-laws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of gpi by any other person; (viii) causing a class of equity securities of gpi to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (ix) causing a class of equity securities of gpi to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended; or (x) any action similar to any of those enumerated in clauses (i) through (ix) of this

restrictions contained in the agreements described in item 6. cibc has the sole right to receive and the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the shares of gpi common stock owned by it. to the best knowledge of cibc as of the date hereof, no executive officers or directors of cibc have legal or beneficial ownership of any shares of gpi common stock and there have been no transactions in the shares of gpi common -5- cusip no. 37940x 10 2 stock effected during the past 60 days by cibc nor, to the best knowledge of cibc, by any executive officers or directors of cibc, except as described in item 3. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. in connection with the asset sale and stock purchase described in item 3, cibc, gpi and national data payment systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of gpi ("ndps"), entered into a marketing alliance agreement (the "marketing alliance agreement") on the closing date. under the marketing alliance agreement, which has an initial term of ten years, (i) cibc will refer all new merchant card processing relationships exclusively to gpi in exchange for a referral fee; (ii) gpi will encourage its new merchant customers who were initially targeted by cibc's and gpi's joint marketing efforts to open merchant accounts with cibc; and (iii) cibc and gpi will work together to develop emerging payment solutions. the marketing alliance will be branded and advertised under the name "cibc merchant services, a global payments alliance" and gpi's use of the cibc name will be covered by a separate trademark license agreement. cibc will also continue to provide the banking services required as part of the merchant card processing business and will provide gpi with access to visa (registered trademark) and mastercard (registered trademark) clearing capabilities in the united states and visa (registered trademark) clearing capabilities in canada. on the closing date, cibc and gpi also entered into an investor rights agreement (the "investor rights agreement"), which grants certain rights and imposes certain restrictions on cibc, as a shareholder of gpi. the investor rights agreement provides, among other things, that during the first two years after the closing date, cibc may sell its shares, without the prior written consent of gpi, only if the sale is to a cibc subsidiary or if cibc is required to do so by a governmental or regulatory body. during the period beginning two years after the closing date and ending on the earlier of (i) six months after termination of the marketing alliance agreement or (ii) the third anniversary of the closing date (such earlier date, the "permitted third party transfer date"), cibc may only sell its shares pursuant to the limitations provided in rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to a tender offer that has not been rejected by the board of directors of gpi (in addition to the means described in the preceding sentence). all transfer restrictions terminate on the permitted third party transfer date. on the earlier of the permitted third party transfer date or the date that cibc is required to sell its shares by a governmental or regulatory body, cibc may participate in any of gpi's registered public offerings of -6- cusip no. 37940x 10 2 securities or may require gpi to register its shares of gpi common stock for sale to the public, subject to customary limitations. in addition, the investor rights agreement restricts cibc's ability to purchase additional shares of gpi common stock until the earlier of (i) five years after the closing date or (ii) six months after the termination of the marketing alliance agreement (the "standstill period"). during the standstill period, cibc may not acquire ownership of more than 29.9% of the aggregate outstanding shares of gpi common stock, unless (i) an unaffiliated third party has commenced a tender offer for 40% or more of the outstanding gpi common stock that the board of directors of gpi does not reject or (ii) an unaffiliated third party acquires 35% or more of the outstanding gpi common stock. furthermore, during the standstill period, cibc may not effect or seek to effect any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to gpi or any of its subsidiaries, form, join or participate in a group for the purposes of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of gpi's voting securities or seek to exercise a controlling influence over the board of directors of gpi. on the closing date, pursuant to the terms of the investor rights agreement, gpi appointed two designees of cibc to the board of directors of gpi, one whose term expires at gpi's annual shareholders' meeting in 2002 and the other whose term expires at gpi's annual shareholders' meeting in 2003. at the expiration of their respective initial terms in office, gpi shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election or re-election of each cibc-designated director to a three-year term on the board of directors of gpi. one of the cibc-designated directors will also be appointed to the audit and compensation committees of the gpi board of directors, as well as other key committees. in the event that gpi fails to comply with the provisions of the u.s. bank holding company act and the bank act (canada), cibc will no longer be bound by the restrictions on transfer of its shares of gpi common stock and will automatically be permitted to demand registration of its shares for resale under the securities act of 1933, as amended. except as set forth above in this item 6, there is no understanding or relationship (legal or otherwise) among the persons named above in item 2 or between any such person and any other person with respect to any securities of gpi, including but not limited to the transfer or voting of any securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or losses, or the giving or withholding of proxies. -7- cusip no. 37940x 10 2 item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibits: 1. asset purchase agreement, dated as of november 9, 2000, among canadian

(d) if a requested registration pursuant to this section 4.2 involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter advises the company in writing that, in its opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration (including securities of the company which are not registrable securities) exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without being reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the price or timing of such offering of the securities to be registered, then the company will include in such registration only the registrable securities requested by the holders to be included in such registration. in the event that the number of registrable securities requested by the holders to be included in such registration exceeds the number which, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, can be sold without having the adverse effect referred to above, the number of such registrable securities to be included in such registration shall be allocated pro rata among all the requesting holders on the basis of the relative number of registrable securities then held by each such holder (provided that any amount thereby allocated to any such holder that exceeds such holder's request will be reallocated among the remaining requesting holders in like manner). in the event that the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration is less than the number which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, can be sold without having the adverse effect referred to above, the company may include in such registration the securities the company or other securityholders of the company propose to sell up to the number of securities -11- that, in the opinion of the underwriter, can be sold without having the adverse effect referred to above. 4.3. obligations of the company. whenever required under this section 4 to effect the registration of any registrable securities, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec within the applicable time period specified by this agreement a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for up to 120 days or such shorter period as is provided herein;

(i) if the indemnification provided for in this section 4.7 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in -18- such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact which gave rise to such action or liability, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party under this section 4.7(d) as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (ii) the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding anything in this section 4.7 to the contrary, no indemnifying party (other than the company) shall be required pursuant to this section 4.7 to contribute any amount in excess of the gross proceeds received by such indemnifying party from the sale of registrable securities in the offering to which the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the indemnified parties relate. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) non-exclusivity. indemnification pursuant to this section 4.7 shall be a non-exclusive remedy, and the obligations of the parties under this section 4.7 shall be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise have to any other party.
