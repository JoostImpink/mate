whereas, the company and stonor are parties to that certain stockholder agreement dated as of may 15, 1996 (the "original agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, the company has granted to stonor certain registration rights with respect to the shares; whereas, immediately prior to the execution of this agreement, the company and stonor are terminating the original agreement; and whereas, the company and the holders desire to enter into this agreement to provide for certain registration rights on the part of the holders. now, therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: article i. registration rights section 1.01. shelf registration: "piggy-back" registration rights (a) if, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the second anniversary of the date hereof, a majority in interest of the holders (as hereinafter defined) shall notify the company in writing that they intend to offer or cause to be offered for public sale all or any portion of their registrable securities (as hereinafter defined), the company will use its best efforts to cause such of the registrable securities as may be requested by the holders to be registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), pursuant to a registration statement on form s-3 (or any comparable successor form) (a "registration statement") for sale on a delayed or continuous basis under rule 415 under the securities act, and to keep such registration effective until the earlier of the second anniversary of the date hereof or the date on which all of such holders' registrable securities registered thereunder are sold; provided, however, that the company shall have no obligation to file a registration statement pursuant to this section 1.01(a) prior to may 15, 1997. if the company shall not then be entitled to utilize form s-3 for any requested registration of registrable securities, the company shall effect any requested registration on such form of registration statement as the company shall then be entitled to utilize. all registration expenses (as hereinafter defined) of such registration and offerings attributable to any registration pursuant to this section 1.01(a) shall be borne by the company. the company may postpone the filing of any registration statement required under this section 1.01(a) for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 120 days if a suspension event (as hereinafter defined) has occurred and is continuing. the company shall not be required to cause a registration statement requested pursuant to this section 1.01(a) to become effective prior to 120 days following the effective date of a registration statement initiated by the company, if the request for registration has been received by the company subsequent to the giving of written notice by the company, made in good faith, to the holders to the page 12 of 26 pages effect that the company is commencing to prepare a company-initiated registration statement (other than a registration effected solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a transaction to which rule 145 or any other similar rule of the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") under the securities act is applicable); provided, however, that the company shall use its best efforts to achieve such effectiveness promptly. the company represents and warrants to each of the holders that (i) no suspension event has occurred and it is not aware of any facts or circumstances which would cause a suspension event to occur on or prior to may 15, 1997 and (ii) it has no current intention of filing with the commission (as hereinafter defined) a company-initiated registration statement. (b) if at any time or times after the date hereof, the company shall determine or be required to register any shares of its common stock for sale under the securities act (whether in connection with a public offering of securities by the company (a "primary offering"), a public offering of securities by stockholders of the company (a "secondary offering"), or both (but not in connection with a registration (i) effected solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a transaction to which rule 145 or any other similar rule of the commission under the securities act is applicable or (ii) in connection with the registration of preferred stock or debt securities of the company which are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock)), the company will promptly give written notice thereof to each of the holders. in connection with any such registration, if within 20 days after the receipt of such notice one or more holders of registrable securities (as hereinafter defined), request the inclusion of some or all of the registrable securities (but not any other shares) held by them in such registration, the company will use its best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of all registrable securities which such holders request to be registered in a writing delivered to the company within 20 days after such holders' receipt of the notice referred to above. in the case of the registration of shares of common stock by the company in connection with an underwritten public offering, (i) the company shall not be required to include any registrable securities in such underwriting unless the holders thereof accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the company and the underwriter or underwriters selected by it, and (ii) if the underwriter(s) determines that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of registrable securities to be offered, the company shall not be required to register registrable securities of the holders in excess of the amount, if any, of shares of the capital stock which the principal underwriter of such underwritten offering shall reasonably and in good faith agree to include in such offering in excess of any amount to be registered for the company, and in the event of any such limitation the number of registrable securities of any holder requesting inclusion in such registration shall be based upon the relative holdings of common stock of all holders requesting such registration (and if any holder would thus be entitled to include more registrable securities as such holder requested to be registered, the excess shall be allocated among other requesting holders pro rata based upon their relative holdings of common stock). all registration expenses relating to the registration and offering of registrable securities pursuant to this section 1.01(b) shall be borne by the company. section 1.02. selection of underwriter. if the holders so elect, the offering of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement filed under this article i shall be in the form of an underwritten offering. if they so elect, the company shall select one or more nationally recognized firms of investment bankers to act as the book-running managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with such offering and shall select any additional investment bankers and managers to be used in connection with the offering. section 1.03. definitions.

(b) holders. for purposes of this agreement, the term "holder" shall mean any holder of registrable securities from time to time, including, without limitation, (i) the holders signatory to this agreement and (ii) any subsequent transferees of such holders of registrable securities.

(b) use its best efforts to continue to qualify at all times for registration of its capital stock on form s-3 or a comparable successor form; (c) furnish to each selling holder such copies of each preliminary and final prospectus and such other documents as such holder may reasonably request to facilitate the sale of such holder's registrable securities; (d) enter into any reasonable underwriting agreement required by the underwriter selected pursuant to section 1.02 on terms satisfactory to the company and the holders; (e) use its best efforts to register or qualify the securities covered by said registration statement under the securities or "blue-sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any selling holders may page 14 of 26 pages reasonably request, provided that the company shall not be required to register or qualify the securities in any jurisdictions which require it to qualify to do business or subject itself to general service of process therein; (f) immediately notify each selling holder, at any time when a prospectus relating to such holder's registrable securities is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event as a result of which such prospectus contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, at the request of any such selling holder, prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (g) cause all such registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange or quoted in each quotation system on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed or quoted; (h) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission and make generally available to its security holders, in each case as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the close of the period covered thereby (90 days in case the period covered corresponds to a fiscal year of the company), an earnings statement of the company which will satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act; and (i) obtain and furnish to each selling holder, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement (and, in the case of an underwritten offering, at the time of delivery of any registrable securities sold pursuant thereto), a cold comfort letter from the company's independent public accountants in the same form and covering the same matters as is typically delivered to underwriters and, in the event that an underwriter or underwriters have been retained in connection with such registration, such cold comfort letter to be provided to the selling holders shall be the same cold comfort letter delivered to such underwriter or underwriters. section 1.05. stop orders;
