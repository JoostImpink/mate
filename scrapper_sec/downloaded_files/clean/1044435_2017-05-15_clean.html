provided, however, that any such sale must not constitute a prohibited transfer and provided, further , that the agent shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if, in the agent&#146;s discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the market for the company securities or otherwise would adversely affect the value of the 5 company securities. if the purported transferee has resold the excess securities before receiving the company&#146;s demand to surrender excess securities to the agent, the purported transferee shall be deemed to have sold the excess securities for the agent, and shall be required to transfer to the agent any prohibited distributions and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the company grants written permission to the purported transferee to retain a portion of such sale proceeds not exceeding the amount that the purported transferee would have received from the agent pursuant to section 14.6 of this article xiv if the agent rather than the purported transferee had resold the excess securities. 14.6 application of proceeds and prohibited distributions. the agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of excess securities and, if the purported transferee has previously resold the excess securities, any amounts received by it from a purported transferee, together, in either case, with any prohibited distributions, as follows: (i) first, such amounts shall be paid to the agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in connection with its duties hereunder; (ii) second, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the purported transferee, up to the amount paid by the purported transferee for the excess securities (or the fair market value at the time of the transfer, in the event the purported transfer of the excess securities was, in whole or in part, a gift, inheritance or similar transfer) which amount (or fair market value) shall be determined at the discretion of the board of directors; and (iii) third, any remaining amounts shall be paid to one or more organizations selected by the board of directors which is described under section 501(c)(3) of the code (or any comparable successor provision) and contributions to which are eligible for deduction under each of sections 170(b)(1)(a), 2055 and 2552 of the code. the purported transferee of excess securities shall have no claim, cause of action or any other recourse whatsoever against any transferor of excess securities. the purported transferee&#146;s sole right with respect to such shares shall be limited to the amount payable to the purported transferee pursuant to this section 14.6 of this article xiv. in no event shall the proceeds of any sale of excess securities pursuant to this section 14.6 of this article xiv inure to the benefit of the company or the agent, except to the extent used to cover costs and expenses incurred by agent in performing its duties hereunder. 14.7 modification of remedies for certain indirect transfers. in the event of any transfer which does not involve a transfer of company securities within the meaning of delaware law but which would cause a 4.99-percent stockholder to violate a restriction on transfers provided for in this article xiv, the application of sections 14.5 and 14.6 of this article xiv shall be modified as described in this section 14.7 of this article xiv. in such case, no such 4.99-percent stockholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is not a company security, but such 4.99-percent stockholder and/or any person whose ownership of company securities is attributed to such 4.99-percent stockholder (such 4.99-percent stockholder or other person, a &#147;remedial holder&#148;) shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to dispose of sufficient company securities (which company securities shall be disposed of in the inverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such 4.99-percent stockholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of this article xiv. such disposition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such number of company securities that are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered excess securities and shall be disposed of through the agent as provided in sections 14.5 and 14.6 of this article xiv, except that the maximum aggregate amount payable to a remedial holder in connection with such sale shall be the fair market value 6 of such excess securities at the time of the purported transfer. a remedial holder shall not be entitled, with respect to such excess securities, to any rights of stockholders of the company, including, without limitation, the right to vote such excess securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any, following the time of the purported transfer. all expenses incurred by the agent in disposing of such excess stock shall be paid out of any amounts due such 4.99- percent stockholder or such other person. the purpose of this section 14.7 of this article xiv is to extend the restrictions in sections 14.2 and 14.5 of this article xiv to situations in which there is a 4.99-percent transaction without a direct transfer of company securities, and this section 14.7 of this article xiv, along with the other provisions of this article xiv, shall be interpreted to produce the same results, with differences as the context requires, as a direct transfer of company securities. 14.8 legal proceedings; prompt enforcement. if the purported transferee fails to surrender the excess securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof to the agent within thirty days from the date on which the company makes a written demand pursuant to section 14.5 of this article xiv (whether or not made within the time specified in section 14.5 of this article xiv), then the company may take such actions as it deems appropriate to enforce the provisions hereof, including the institution of legal proceedings to compel the surrender. nothing in this section 14.8 of this article xiv shall (i) be deemed inconsistent with any transfer of the excess securities provided in this article xiv being void ab initio , (ii) preclude the company in its discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings without a prior demand or (iii) cause any failure of the company to act within the time periods set forth in section 14.5 of this article xiv to constitute a waiver or loss of any right of the company under this article xiv. the board of directors may authorize such additional actions as it deems advisable to give effect to the provisions of this article xiv. 14.9 liability. to the fullest extent permitted by law, any stockholder subject to the provisions of this article xiv who knowingly violates the provisions of this article xiv and any persons controlling, controlled by or under common control with such stockholder shall be jointly and severally liable to the company for, and shall indemnify and hold the company harmless against, any and all damages suffered as a result of such violation, including but not limited to damages resulting from a reduction in, or elimination of, the company&#146;s ability to utilize its tax benefits, and attorneys&#146; and auditors&#146; fees incurred in connection with such violation. 14.10 obligation to provide information. as a condition to the registration of the transfer of any stock, any person who is a beneficial, legal or record holder of stock, and any proposed transferee and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the proposed transferee, shall provide such information as the company may request from time to time in order to determine compliance with this article xiv or the status of the tax benefits of the company. 7 14.11 legends. the board of directors may require that any certificates issued by the company evidencing ownership of shares of stock that are subject to the restrictions on transfer and ownership contained in this article xiv bear the following legend: &#147;the restated certificate of incorporation of the corporation as amended (the &#147;certificate of incorporation&#148;) contains restrictions prohibiting the transfer (as defined in the certificate of incorporation) of stock of the corporation (including the creation or grant of certain options, rights and warrants) without the prior authorization of the board of directors of the corporation (the &#147;board of directors&#148;) if such transfer affects the percentage of stock of the corporation (within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;code&#148;) and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder) that is treated as owned by a 4.99-percent stockholder (as defined in the certificate of incorporation). if the transfer restrictions are violated, then the transfer will be void ab initio and the purported transferee of the stock will be required to transfer excess securities (as defined in the certificate of incorporation) to the corporation&#146;s agent. in the event of a transfer which does not involve securities of the corporation within the meaning of the general corporation law of the state of delaware (&#147;securities&#148;) but which would violate the transfer restrictions, the purported transferee (or the record owner) of the securities that violate the transfer restrictions will be required to transfer sufficient securities pursuant to the terms provided for in the certificate of incorporation to cause the 4.99-percent stockholder to no longer be in violation of the transfer restrictions. the corporation will furnish without charge to the holder of record of this certificate a copy of the certificate of incorporation containing the above-referenced transfer restrictions upon written request to the corporation at its principal place of business.&#148;
