provided that the failure to give such notice to the company or the major holders shall not give rise to any claim or liability against the company or the underwriters, including the representatives. notwithstanding any other provisions of this lock-up agreement, if the representatives, in their reasonable judgment, after consultation with the company, determine that a record or beneficial owner of any lock-up securities should be granted an early release from a lock-up agreement due to circumstances of an emergency or hardship, then the major holders shall not have any right to be granted an early release pursuant to the terms of this paragraph. for purposes of this lock-up agreement, each of the following persons is a "major holder": each record or beneficial owner, as of the date hereof, of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the company on an as- converted to common stock basis (for purposes of determining record or beneficial ownership of a stockholder, all shares of capital stock held by investment funds affiliated with such stockholder shall be aggregated). the undersigned understands that, if (1) the execution of the underwriting agreement in connection with the offering shall not have occurred on or before december 31, 2017, (2) the company files an application to withdraw the registration statement relating to the offering, (3) the underwriting agreement (other than the provisions thereof which survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to payment for and delivery of the common stock to be sold thereunder or (4) the representatives, on behalf of the underwriters, advise the company, or the company advises the representatives, in writing, prior to the execution of the underwriting agreement, that they have determined not to proceed with the offering, the undersigned shall be released from all obligations under this agreement.
