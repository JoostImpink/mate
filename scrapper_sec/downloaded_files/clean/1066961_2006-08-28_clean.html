(f) mr. kwok is a citizen of hong kong. item 3. source and amount of funds and other consideration. on july 7, 2006, cyber merchants exchange, inc., a california corporation (the "registrant" or "cyber") entered into an agreement to acquire a hong-kong based recordable digital versatile disk manufacturing company by executing an exchange agreement ("exchange agreement") with ki equity partners ii, llc, a delaware limited liability company ("ki equity"), prime fortune enterprises limited, an international business company incorporated in the british virgin islands ("prime"), the equity owners of prime that consist of (a) prime corporate developments limited ("prime corporate"), (b) kwok chung and (c) lui sau wan (collectively, the "prime shareholders"), and hamptons investment group ltd. ("hig"). under the terms of the exchange agreement, immediately prior to the closing, hig was to receive 58.82352 shares of prime's issued capital shares (the "hig shares") as payment for its services as a finder in connection with the exchange, and worldwide gateway co., ltd. ("gateway") was to receive 2,850,000 shares of cyber's common stock from cyber as payment for consulting services gateway rendered to cyber in connection with the exchange. pursuant to the exchange agreement, cyber was to acquire all of the issued capital shares and equity ownership interests of prime (the "prime shares") from the prime shareholders and hig, in exchange for cyber issuing 1,000,000 shares of its series a convertible preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of cyber ("series a preferred shares") to the prime shareholders and hig (the "exchange"). on the execution date of the exchange agreement, prime owned all of the equity interest in infosmart group limited, an international business company incorporated in the british virgin islands ("infosmart"), which consisted of one (1) infosmart issued capital share. however, in august 2006 and prior to the closing of the exchange (the "closing"), the board of directors of prime and infosmart and their respective shareholders decided to re-structure certain shareholdings in infosmart, so that after the re-structuring, prime would no longer own 100% of infosmart's issued capital shares and so that the prime shareholders would replace prime as the direct owners of 100% of the issued capital shares and equity ownership of infosmart (the "re-structuring"). as a result of the re-structuring, the prime shareholders became the direct equity owners of 100% of infosmart's issued capital shares. after the re-structuring, on august 14, 2006, cyber entered into a first amendment to the exchange agreement (the "amendment") with ki equity, prime, the prime shareholders, hig, infosmart, and each of the equity owners of infosmart. under the terms of the amendment, the exchange agreement was amended so that the term "company", which was defined in the exchange agreement as "prime fortune enterprises limited, an international business company incorporated in the british virgin islands", was changed to be defined instead as "infosmart group limited, an international business company incorporated in the british virgin islands" so that all of the obligations, representations, warranties, liabilities and responsibilities of prime under the exchange agreement became the obligations, representations, warranties, liabilities and responsibilities of infosmart. the parties further agreed and acknowledged that the infosmart shareholders (defined below) would replace the prime shareholders as the exchanging party to the exchange agreement that will transfer and contribute all of their infosmart shares to cyber in exchange for cyber's issuance to the infosmart shareholders of 1,000,000 shares of cyber's series a preferred shares, and that all of the obligations, representations, warranties, liabilities and responsibilities of the prime shareholders under the exchange agreement became the obligations, representations, warranties, liabilities and responsibilities of the infosmart shareholders. as a result of the amendment: (1) prime's obligation under the exchange agreement to issue capital shares to hig immediately prior to the closing was transferred to infosmart, and thus infosmart issued 58.82352 infosmart capital shares to hig as payment for hig's services; (2) the capital shares exchanged with cyber's series a preferred shares pursuant to the exchange agreement consisted of 100% of infosmart issued capital shares (the "infosmart shares"), (2) the holders of 100% of infosmart's issued capital shares, which immediately prior to the closing were prime corporate, kwok chung, lui sau wan and hig (collectively referred to as the "infosmart shareholders"), transferred their infosmart shares to cyber in exchange for cyber's issuance of cyber's series a preferred stock to the infosmart shareholders, and (3) infosmart and the infosmart shareholders replaced prime and the prime shareholders as a parties to the exchange agreement and assumed all of prime's and the prime shareholders' obligations, representations, warranties, liabilities and responsibilities under the exchange agreement. the closing of the exchange occurred on august 16, 2006. at the closing, cyber acquired all of the infosmart shares from the infosmart shareholders, and the infosmart shareholders transferred and contributed all of their infosmart shares to cyber. in exchange, cyber issued 1,000,000 series a preferred shares to the infosmart shareholders. each series a preferred share shall be convertible into 116.721360 shares of cyber's common stock, subject to adjustments. the series a preferred shares will immediately and automatically be converted into shares of cyber's common stock (the "mandatory conversion") upon the approval by a majority of cyber's stockholders (voting together on an as-converted-to-common-stock basis), following the exchange, of an increase in the number of authorized shares of cyber's common stock from 40,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares and a change of cyber's corporate name (collectively, the "corporate actions"). in connection with the exchange and as a condition to the closing of the exchange, on august 16, 2006, ki equity, the infosmart shareholders, and gateway entered into a shareholder voting agreement (the "voting agreement") to vote their cyber shares in favor of the corporate actions. pursuant to the voting agreement, ki equity, gateway and the infosmart shareholders also agreed (a) that they will take all such actions so that the number of cyber's directors shall be seven, (b) to vote in favor of the election of the six infosmart director designees (which currently includes po nei sze, chung kwok and andrew chang and three other independent directors to be designated by infosmart) and ki equity's one director designee to the board of directors of cyber (collectively the "director designees") as set forth in the voting agreement, and (c) that they will not vote (or cause a vote) for the removal of the director designees from the board of directors. the voting agreement terminates on the first anniversary of the date of the voting agreement. the consummation of the exchange was contingent on a minimum of $7,000,000 (or such lesser amount as mutually agreed to by infosmart and the placement agent) being subscribed for, and funded into escrow, by certain accredited and institutional investors ("investors") for the purchase of shares of cyber's series b convertible preferred stock ("series b preferred shares") promptly after the closing of the exchange under terms and conditions approved by cyber's board of directors immediately following the exchange (the "financing"). the closing of the financing was contingent on the closing of the exchange, and the exchange was contingent on the closing of the financing. the closing of the financing also occurred on august 16, 2006. immediately following the closing, cyber received gross proceeds of approximately $7.65 million in connection with the financing from the investors. pursuant to subscription agreements entered into with these investors, cyber sold 1,092,857.143 shares of its series b preferred shares to the investors at a price per share of $7.00. each share of series b preferred stock is currently convertible into 26.819924 shares of cyber's common stock, subject to adjustments. on an as-converted basis, the series b preferred shares would currently convert into 29,310,345 shares of cyber's common stock. the holders of series b and series a preferred shares are entitled to vote together with the holders of the common stock, as a single class, upon all matters submitted to holders of common stock for a vote. each series a and series b preferred share will carry a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion based on the then applicable conversion rate. of the 1,000,000 series a preferred shares issued, 200,222.2302 shares of the series a preferred shares were issued to the reporting person, and on an as-converted basis, these shares would currently convert into 23,370,211 shares of cyber's common stock. a copy of the exchange agreement was filed as exhibit 2.1 to cyber's current report on form 8-k filed by the company on july 12, 2006, and such exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
