(this "statement") relates to the common stock, par value $.001 per share ("unison common stock"), of unison software, inc., a delaware corporation ("unison"). the address of the principal executive offices of unison is 5101 patrick henry drive, santa clara, california 95054. item 2. identity and background. international business machines corporation ("ibm") is a new york corporation with its principal office and business at new orchard road, armonk, new york 10504. ibm develops, manufactures and sells advanced information processing products, including computers and micro electronic technology, software, networking systems and information technology-related services. the attached schedule i is a list of the directors and executive officers of ibm which contains the following information with respect to each such person: (a) name; (b) business address; (c) present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted; and (d) citizenship. during the last five years, neither ibm nor, to the best of ibm's knowledge, any person named in schedule i (i) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of which such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violations with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. pursuant to the stockholder agreement dated as of september 12, 1997 (the "stockholder agreement"), among ibm and certain stockholders (the "significant stockholders") of unison set forth on schedule a thereto, ibm may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 3,723,601 shares of unison common stock. see the response to item 5. the significant stockholders entered into the stockholder agreement to induce ibm to enter into the agreement and plan of merger dated as of september 12, 1997 (the "merger agreement"), among ibm, new orchard corp., a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of ibm ("sub"), and unison. the descriptions of the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively. item 4. purpose of transaction. the purpose of the stockholder agreement was to induce ibm to enter into the merger agreement and to increase the likelihood that the approval of unison's stockholders required in connection with the merger of unison with and into sub (the "merger") pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement will be obtained. in the merger, sub will continue as the surviving corporation ("surviving corporation") and as a wholly owned subsidiary of ibm. in addition to providing for the merger, the merger agreement restricts unison from, among other things, engaging in certain transactions, including extraordinary corporate transactions (other than the merger), selling certain assets, changing its capitalization (including by purchasing any of its capital stock or by issuing any capital stock or other voting securities), amending its certificate of incorporation or by-laws, paying dividends, incurring indebtedness, making loans or advances to other persons, making certain acquisitions and making certain capital expenditures, and otherwise requires unison to operate in the ordinary course of business. pursuant to the merger agreement, in connection with the merger the directors of sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (the "effective time") will be the directors of the surviving corporation and the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will become the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws, respectively, of the surviving corporation. in connection with the merger, it is expected that the unison common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market system and will become eligible for termination of registration under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"). ibm intends, subject to market conditions, to make open market purchases of such number of additional shares of unison common stock as will constitute, when taken together with the shares of unison common stock subject to the stockholder agreement, 40% of the fully diluted number of shares of unison common stock. any material changes in the percentage of unison common stock beneficially owned by ibm will be reported by the filing of an amendment to this schedule 13d in accordance with rule 13d-2 under the exchange act. the descriptions of the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. as of september 12, 1997, 3,723,601 shares of unison common stock were subject to the stockholder agreement. such shares represented approximately 31% of unison common stock issued and outstanding as of september 12, 1997. under the terms of the stockholder agreement, the significant stockholders have agreed, among other things, (i) to vote (or cause to be voted) their respective shares of unison common stock in favor of (a) approval and adoption of the merger agreement, (b) approval of the merger and (c) approval of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) to vote such shares against any alternative transaction or any amendment of unison's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any transaction which would frustrate, impede, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (iii) subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer any of such shares or enter into any arrangement with respect to such shares, (iv) except as described in clause (v) below, not to grant any proxy or authorization with respect to such shares and (v) to grant to ibm and certain of its officers an irrevocable proxy to vote such shares as described in clauses (i) and (ii) above. accordingly, pursuant to the stockholder agreement, ibm may be deemed to have acquired shared voting power with respect to the unison common stock subject to the stockholder agreement. the descriptions of the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. the information set forth under items 3, 4 and 5 above are incorporated herein by reference. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit 1: agreement and plan of merger dated as of september 12, 1997, among ibm, sub and unison. exhibit 2: stockholder agreement dated as of september 12, 1997, among ibm and the significant stockholders.

new orchard corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("sub"), and unison software, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"). whereas, the respective boards of directors of parent, sub and the company, and parent, acting as the sole stockholder of sub, have approved the merger of the company with and into sub (the "merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement; whereas, substantially concurrently herewith and as a condition and inducement to parent's willingness to enter into this agreement, parent and certain stockholders (the "principal stockholders") of the company have entered into a stockholder agreement (the "stockholder agreement"); whereas, substantially concurrently herewith and as a condition and inducement to parent's willingness to enter into this agreement, parent and certain stockholders of the company who are employed by the company have entered into noncompetition agreements (the "noncompetition agreements") pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other things, agreed to not have certain relationships (as defined in the noncompetition agreements) with certain third parties during the noncompetition period (as defined in the noncompetition agreements); whereas, parent, sub and the company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the merger; whereas, for united states federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"); and now, therefore, in consideration of the represen tations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: article i the merger section 1.01. the merger. upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement, and in accordance with the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"), the company shall be merged with and into sub at the effective time (as defined in section 1.03). following the

obligations of the company in accordance with the dgcl. at the election of parent, any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary (as defined in section 8.03) of parent may be substituted for sub as a constituent corporation in the merger. in such event, the parties hereto agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this agreement in order to reflect such substitution. section 1.02. closing. the closing of the merger (the "closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in article vi (the "closing date"), at the offices of cravath, swaine & moore, worldwide plaza, 825 eighth avenue, new york, n.y. 10019, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. section 1.03. effective time. subject to the provisions of this agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the closing date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "certificate of merger") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the dgcl and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the dgcl. the merger shall become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the delaware secretary of state, or at such other time as parent and the company shall agree should be specified in the certificate of merger (the time the merger becomes effective being the "effective time"). section 1.04. effects of the merger. the merger shall have the effects set forth in section 259 of the dgcl. section 1.05. certificate of incorporation and by-laws. (a) the certificate of incorporation of sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, subject in all cases to section 5.07, except that the name of the surviving corporation in such certificate of incorporation will be changed to be "unison software, inc.". (b) the by-laws of sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, shall be the by-laws of the surviving corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law (subject in all cases to section 5.07). section 1.06. directors. the directors of sub immediately prior to the effective time shall be the directors of the surviving corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. section 1.07. officers. the officers of the company immediately prior to the effective time shall be the officers of the surviving corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. article ii effect of the merger on the capital stock of the constituent corporations; exchange of certificates section 2.01. effect on capital stock. as of the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the company ("company common stock") or any shares of capital stock of sub: (a) capital stock of sub. each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of sub shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the effective time. (b) cancelation of treasury stock and parent-owned stock. each share of company common stock that is owned by the company and each share of company common stock that is owned by parent shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no shares of capital stock, par value $1.25 per share, of parent ("parent common stock"), cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. (c) conversion of company common stock. (i) except as otherwise provided in section 2.01(d) and subject to sections 2.01(b) and 2.01(c)(iii), each issued and outstanding share of company common stock, shall be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof, one of the following (as adjusted pursuant to section 2.01(d), the "merger consideration"): (a) for each such share of company common stock with respect to which an election to receive parent common stock ("stock consideration") has been effectively made, and not revoked or lost, pursuant to section 2.03 (a "stock election"), the right to receive a number of shares of parent common stock equal to a fraction (the "exchange ratio"), the numerator of which is $15 and the denominator of which is the parent common stock price. the "parent common stock price" means the average of the closing sales prices of parent common stock on the new york stock exchange ("nyse") composite transactions tape on each of the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the second trading day prior to the date of the effective time; and (b) for each such share of company common stock with respect to which an election to receive cash consideration (the "cash consideration") has been effectively made, and not revoked or lost, or deemed to have been made, pursuant to section 2.03 (a "cash election"), the right to receive cash from parent, in an amount equal to $15. (ii) as of the effective time all shares of company common stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time represented any such shares of company common stock (a "certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock in accordance with section 2.02(e) upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with section 2.02, without interest. (iii) notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, shares of company common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and that are held by a holder who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal for such shares in accordance with section 262 of the dgcl ("dissenting shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the merger consideration, unless such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his right to appraisal and payment, as the case may be. if, after the effective time, such holder shall have so failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the effective time, the right to receive the consideration described in section 2.03(f), without any interest thereon. the company shall give parent prompt notice of any dissenting shares (and shall also give parent prompt notice of any withdrawals of such demands for appraisal rights) and parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. neither the company nor the surviving corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal rights. (d) proration. (i) the aggregate amount of cash to be paid to holders of company common stock pursuant to this article ii (the "cash cap") shall not exceed the product of (x) $15 and (y) the number of shares of company common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time minus the sum of (a) the number of shares of company common stock that will be canceled pursuant to section 2.01(b) and (b) the number of dissenting shares and (z) 0.5. (ii) in the event that the aggregate amount of cash requested in cash elections received by (and deemed to have been received by) the exchange agent in accordance with section 2.03 (the "requested cash amount") exceeds the cash cap, each holder making a cash election (and each holder who is deemed to have made a cash election pursuant to section 2.03) shall receive, with respect to each share of company common stock for which a cash election has been made or deemed made, (x) cash in an amount equal to the product of (a) $15 and (b) the cash proration factor (as defined below) (such product, the "prorated cash amount") and (y) a number of shares of parent common stock equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to $15 minus the prorated cash amount and the denominator of which is the parent common stock price. the "cash proration factor" shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the cash cap and the denominator of which is the requested cash amount. section 2.02. exchange of certificates.
