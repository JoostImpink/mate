as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party under this section 6.9 as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if a contribution pursuant to this section 6.9

or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in section 6.6 above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are

of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company, the investor or any underwriter, or any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers or controlling persons and shall survive the

upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. section 6.8 conduct of indemnification proceedings . promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this article vi , such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided , that the failure of the indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this article vi , except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party&#146;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified party and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such 23 indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. it is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. any such separate firm (x) for the investor, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of the investor shall be designated in writing by the investor, and (y) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the company. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. no indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (a) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding, and (b) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. section 6.9 contribution . if the indemnification provided for in this article vi from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party under this section 6.9 as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if a contribution pursuant to this section 6.9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to a contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. section 6.10 participation in public offering . the investor may not participate in any public offering hereunder unless the investor completes and executes all questionnaires, 24

any dividend, split, issuance, reverse split, combination, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise. section 6.14 termination of registration rights . the registration rights contained in this article vi shall terminate and be of no further force and effect with respect to any person holding registrable securities upon the date on which all registrable
