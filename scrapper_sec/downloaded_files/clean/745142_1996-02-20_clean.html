provided herein, each partner agrees that he will not transfer all or any part of his interest in the partnership other than in strict compliance with this agreement. in no event shall a partner transfer his interest in the partnership to a transferee who is not a permitted transferee of such partner. this agreement states the 24 25 exclusive procedure for transfer of an interest in the partnership. any attempted transfer of an interest in the partnership other than in strict compliance with this agreement shall be null and void. 9.2 permitted transfer. subject to the first option and the second option, any partner transferring an interest in the partnership to a permitted transferee of such partner shall give written notice of any such transfer to the managing partners, who shall thereupon revise the partnership percentages to reflect the transfer. with the consent of the managing partners, the transferee (if he is not already a partner) may be admitted as an additional partner in the partnership. 9.3 transfer of title. all transfers of an interest in the partnership to any partner pursuant to the first option, and to the partnership pursuant to the second option, shall be transferred and delivered to such partners or the partnership, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances of every kind and description. 9.4 notice of intent to transfer. any transferor partner who desires to transfer all or any portion of his interest in the partnership shall give notice of his intent to transfer, in writing, to the managing partners. in the event that the transferor partner has received a written offer for the purchase of his interest in the partnership, said notice shall include a copy of such written offer and shall set forth the offer price. the managing partners shall promptly notify the other partners of the 25 26 transferor partner's intent to transfer, which notice shall include a copy of any written offer. 9.5 first option. the partners, other than the transferor partner, shall have an option (but not the obligation) to purchase all or any portion of the interest in the partnership proposed to be sold by the transferor partner at the offer price or, if the transferor partner did not submit a written offer, at the transfer price and, in either case, in accordance with the provisions of this section 9. this option shall first be available to partners of the same class as, and who are permitted transferees of, the transferor partner (the "same class partners"). the same class partners may exercise the option by giving notice to the managing partners of their intention to do so within sixty (60) days of the date of the transferor partner's notice. the same class partners may purchase the offered interest in proportion to their relative partnership percentages of the same class or as they may otherwise agree. if and to the extent that the same class partners fail to elect to purchase all of the offered interest, the managing partners shall give prompt notice thereof to the partners of the other class who are permitted transferees of the transferor partner (the "other class partners"). the other class partners shall have the option to purchase all or part of any remaining interest proposed to be sold. the other class partners may exercise their option by giving notice to the managing partners of their intention to do so within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the same class partners' sixty (60) day option period. the other class 26 27 partners may purchase the offered interest in proportion to their relative partnership percentages of the same class or as they may otherwise agree. the interest in the partnership so purchased will be added to the interest in the partnership of the partners who have purchased said interest, as an interest of the same class as that held by each respective purchasing partner, and their partnership percentages and capital accounts shall be adjusted accordingly by the managing partners. 9.6 second option. the partnership shall have an additional sixty (60) days after the expiration of the two option periods set forth in section 9.5 to elect to purchase all or part of the interest in the partnership of the transferor partner not purchased pursuant to the first option, at the offer price or, if there is no written offer, at the transfer price. the interest in the partnership so purchased from a transferor partner, including the related partnership percentage and capital account, shall be allocated among all of the then remaining partners, who shall succeed to such interest as an interest of the same class held by such remaining partners. in the event a transferor partner has given notice of his intention to sell his entire interest in the partnership without a written offer, it being the transferor partner's intention to withdraw from the partnership, the exercise of the second option shall be mandatory with respect to any portion of the transferor partner's interest in the partnership not purchased pursuant to the first option, and the partnership shall exercise its second option 27 28 with respect to any portion of the transferor partner's interest in the partnership not purchased pursuant to the first option. 9.7 exercise of entire option. in the event that the transferor partner has given notice of a written offer, then, if the option to purchase all of the subject interest is not exercised pursuant to the first option and the second option, the transferor partner shall no longer be under an obligation to sell such interest pursuant to the first option and the second option and, during the ninety (90) day period following the termination of the second option, the transferor partner may sell the offered interest to the permitted transferee making the written offer at the offer price or on other terms no more favorable than the terms contained in the written offer. no transfer may be consummated after such ninety (90) day period or on terms more favorable than those set forth in the written offer without first again complying with this section 9. any permitted transferee who acquires an interest in the partnership pursuant to this section 9 shall become a party hereto and be subject to the terms of this agreement. 9.8 terms of purchase. any interest in the partnership to be sold pursuant to the first option or the second option shall be purchased at the price provided in section 9.5 or section 9.6 hereof, as the case may be. subject to section 9.12 hereof, the closing of the purchase and sale shall take place at the partnership's office within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable option periods. notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in a written offer and subject 28 29 to the provisions of section 9.9 hereof, payment for the interest in the partnership purchased pursuant to the first option or the second option shall be made in ten (10) equal installments of principal. the first installment shall be made contemporaneously with the transfer and each succeeding payment shall be made on the annual anniversary date thereof. the partnership or any partner purchasing an interest of the transferor partner may, however, prepay all or part of the purchase price at the time of the transfer or at any time thereafter without premium or penalty. each deferred payment shall bear interest at the lesser of eight percent (8%) per annum or the prime or base rate of interest charged by the first national bank of chicago. said rate of interest shall be determined at the time of transfer and shall be adjusted on each annual anniversary date thereof. in no event, however, shall the rate of interest be less than the applicable federal rate determined at the time of the transfer. 9.9 maximum obligation of the partnership. if the partnership purchases the interest of one or more transferor partners pursuant to the second option, the partnership shall not be obligated to pay, in the aggregate in any calendar year, pursuant to section 9.8 hereof an aggregate amount exceeding the greater of (a) the annual dividends received by the partnership with respect to the stock or (b) two percent (2%) of the partnership value (the "redemption cap"). if, as a result of the application of the redemption cap, amounts otherwise due are not paid to a transferor partner, such unpaid amounts shall be due and 29 30 payable in the following year; provided, however, that the redemption cap as determined in the following year shall continue to limit the aggregate obligation of the partnership during such year so that any unpaid amounts continue to be deferred until such time as the total payments to transferor partners during a year are within the redemption cap determined for such year. in the event that there are two (2) or more transferor partners at any one time and the payments due from the partnership to the transferor partners exceed the redemption cap, then payments to such transferor partners shall be reduced proportionately, from time to time and at any time, based on the outstanding principal owed to each transferor partner. 9.10 admission of partners. except as otherwise provided in section 9.2, no additional partners shall be admitted to the partnership without first obtaining the written consent of all partners. notwithstanding the foregoing, no additional partner shall be admitted to the partnership unless at the time that the proposed additional partner is to be admitted to the partnership (a) the partnership is a permitted transferee of such proposed additional partner and (b) the addition to the partnership of such proposed additional partner would not cause the partnership to cease being a permitted transferee of any or all of the then partners of the partnership. upon the admission of an additional partner, all references in this agreement to the partners shall be 30 31 deemed to include the new partner. the partners shall determine what rights and voice an additional partner shall have in the management and conduct of the partnership. 9.11 distribution of a partner's interest. the termination of any trust which is a partner shall not terminate the partnership. upon the allocation or distribution of all or any portion of the partnership interest of a trust which is a partner pursuant to the exercise of any power of appointment, or otherwise, to a beneficiary of such trust or to another person or persons or to another trust or trusts, whether or not such distribution shall terminate such distributing trust, each such distributee, notwithstanding the provisions hereof, shall become a partner hereunder to the extent of the proportionate share of the partnership interest distributed to him, subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, provided however, that such distributee must, in all events, be a permitted transferee. if any such intended distributee is not a permitted transferee, the trustee (or any other partner) shall give notice thereof to the managing partners, whereupon the partners and the partnership shall have the rights set forth in sections 9.5 and 9.6 hereof to purchase the interest in the partnership owned by the trust. 9.12 transfer date restrictions. notwithstanding anything in this article 9 to the contrary, no transfer, acquisition or redemption of an interest in the partnership shall be made and no adjustment to the partners' interests in the partnership shall be effective, and no transferee of an interest in the partnership 31 32 shall be admitted as a partner, during any period between the record date and payment date of a dividend declared to be paid with respect to shares of the stock. any such purported transfer, acquisition or redemption shall be effective and reflected in the books of the partnership on and as of the first day following the dividend payment date. 10. withdrawal, death or bankruptcy of a partner. 10.1 withdrawal. any partner, including a trust which is a partner hereunder, shall have the right to withdraw from the partnership at any time upon giving notice thereof in writing to the managing partners pursuant to section 9.4 hereof, and the provisions of section 9 hereof shall be applicable. in the event of such withdrawal, the partnership shall not be wound up or liquidated and the withdrawing partner shall not have the right to compel liquidation of the partnership. the payments to the withdrawing partner pursuant to section 9 hereof shall be in lieu of any amount payable pursuant to section 42 of the uniform partnership act including any interest or profits payable pursuant to that section. 10.2 death of a partner. upon the death of a partner during the term of the partnership, the partnership business shall not be wound up or terminated, but shall be continued by the remaining partners. the executor or administrator (the "personal representative") of the estate of the deceased partner, notwithstanding section 9 hereof, shall immediately succeed to the 32 33 interest of the deceased partner in the partnership, and such personal representative shall have the same rights and obligations in the partnership as the deceased partner would have had, had he survived (such rights and obligations shall include, but shall not be limited to, rights to participate in the conduct of partnership business and to share in the profits and losses of the partnership) except that, if the deceased partner was a managing partner, the personal representative shall not have the right to become a managing partner. the personal representative shall, if at all possible, transfer its interest to a permitted transferee and, to the extent that transfer to a permitted transferee is not possible, shall, promptly upon discovery thereof, give notice to the partnership pursuant to section 9.4 hereof of its intention to withdraw from the partnership. the personal representative shall not have the right to compel liquidation of the partnership. the rights of the personal representative set forth in this section 10.2 and the payments, if any, to a personal representative that withdraws from the partnership are in lieu of any amount payable pursuant to section 42 of the uniform partnership act including any interest or profits payable pursuant thereto. 10.3 bankruptcy, etc. in the event the interest of a partner in the partnership shall be attached or taken in execution, or in the event a partner shall be adjudicated a bankrupt or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or in the event its interest is made subject to a charging order, the partnership shall not be wound up or terminated and the partnership's business shall 33 34 be continued, except that upon notice thereof to that partner, the other partners and the partnership shall have the rights set forth in sections 9.5 and 9.6 hereof to purchase the interest in the partnership of such partner. 11. dissolution and liquidation. the dissolution of the partnership shall occur as provided in section 4 hereof; provided, however, if an event specified in section 4 hereof occurs, the partners may, within sixty (60) days of the date such event occurs, unanimously vote to continue the partnership business, in which case the partnership shall continue thereafter as agreed to by the partners. unless otherwise provided herein or otherwise agreed by all of the partners, upon dissolution of the partnership, the partnership shall be terminated and the remaining managing partners shall become the liquidating trustees. the liquidating trustees shall take full account of the partnership's assets and liabilities and the receivables of the partnership shall be collected and its assets liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair market value therefor. if the liquidating trustees reasonably determine that it would be in the best interests of the partners to do so, all or any portion of the assets of the partnership shall be distributed in kind. the proceeds from the liquidation of the assets of the partnership and collection of the partnership's receivables, together with the property distributed in kind, to the extent 34 35 sufficient therefor, shall be applied and distributed in the following order of priority: (a) to the payment and discharge of all of the partnership's debts and liabilities, except (i) the claims of secured creditors whose obligations

debts and liabilities of the partnership due to partners; (c) to the establishment of reserves which the liquidating trustees reasonably determine to be necessary; and (d) the balance, if any, to the partners in accordance with the positive balances in their capital accounts after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations for all periods. 12. trust partners. 12.1 trustee liability. when this agreement is executed by the trustee of any trust, such execution is, and shall be, by the trustee, not individually but solely as trustee in the exercise and under the power of authority conferred upon and vested in such trustee. it is expressly understood and agreed that nothing herein contained shall be construed as creating any liability on any such trustee personally to pay any amounts required to be paid hereunder, or to perform any covenant, either express or implied, 35 36 contained herein, all such liability, if any, being expressly waived by the parties hereto by their execution hereof. any liability of any partner which is a trust to the partnership or to any third person shall be only that of such trust to the full extent of its trust estate and shall not be a personal liability of any trustee, grantor or beneficiary thereof. 12.2 status of successor trustees as partner. any successor trustee or trustees of any trust as a partner herein shall be entitled to exercise the same rights and privileges and be subject to the same duties and obligations as his predecessor trustee. as used in this agreement, the term "trustee" shall include any or all

necessary or available with respect to the preparation of such returns shall be made by the managing partners. as soon as is reasonably practical after the close of each fiscal year, the partnership shall furnish each partner with a statement (which may be in the form of a duplicate schedule k-1 of the form 1065 required to be filed by the partnership with the internal revenue service, or such other comparable form at any time hereafter required to be so filed) showing the contributions, withdrawals, income, gains, deductions, losses and credits charged or 24 25 credited to such partner and

accounts at such bank or banks as shall be determined by the managing partners who shall have the right to designate their agents to execute checks for withdrawals and make, deliver, accept and endorse commercial paper in connection with the partnership business. 9. transfer of partnership interests and limitations thereon. 9.1 exclusive procedure. except as otherwise provided herein, each partner agrees that he will not transfer all or any part of his interest in the partnership other than in strict compliance with this agreement. in no event shall a partner transfer his interest in the partnership to a transferee who is not a permitted transferee of such partner. this agreement states the exclusive procedure for transfer of an interest in the partnership. any attempted transfer of an interest in the partnership other than in strict compliance with this agreement shall be null and void. 9.2 permitted transfer. subject to the first option and the second option, any partner transferring an interest in the 25 26 partnership to a permitted transferee of such partner shall give written notice of any such transfer to the managing partners, who shall thereupon revise the partnership percentages to reflect the transfer. with the consent of the managing partners, the transferee (if he is not already a partner) may be admitted as an additional partner in the partnership. 9.3 transfer of title. all transfers of an interest in the partnership to any partner pursuant to the first option, and to the partnership pursuant to the second option, shall be transferred and delivered to such partners or the partnership, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances of every kind and description. 9.4 notice of intent to transfer. any transferor partner who desires to transfer all or any portion of his interest in the partnership shall give notice of his intent to transfer, in writing, to the managing partners. in the event that the transferor partner has received a written offer for the purchase of his interest in the partnership, said notice shall include a copy of such written offer and shall set forth the offer price. the managing partners shall promptly notify the other partners of the transferor partner's intent to transfer, which notice shall include a copy of any written offer. 9.5 first option. the partners, other than the transferor partner, shall have an option (but not the obligation) to purchase all or any portion of the interest in the partnership proposed to be sold by the transferor partner at the offer price or, if the 26 27 transferor partner did not submit a written offer, at the transfer price and, in either case, in accordance with the provisions of this section 9. this option shall first be available to partners of the same class as, and who are permitted transferees of, the transferor partner (the "same class partners"). the same class partners may exercise the option by giving notice to the managing partners of their intention to do so within sixty (60) days of the date of the transferor partner's notice. the same class partners may purchase the offered interest in proportion to their relative partnership percentages of the same class or as they may otherwise agree. if and to the extent that the same class partners fail to elect to purchase all of the offered interest, the managing partners shall give prompt notice thereof to the partners of the other class who are permitted transferees of the transferor partner (the "other class partners"). the other class partners shall have the option to purchase all or part of any remaining interest proposed to be sold. the other class partners may exercise their option by giving notice to the managing partners of their intention to do so within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the same class partners' sixty (60) day option period. the other class partners may purchase the offered interest in proportion to their relative partnership percentages of the same class or as they may otherwise agree. the interest in the partnership so purchased will be added to the interest in the partnership of the partners who have purchased said interest, as an interest of the same class as that held by each respective purchasing partner, and their 27 28 partnership percentages and capital accounts shall be adjusted accordingly by the managing partners. 9.6 second option. the partnership shall have an additional sixty (60) days after the expiration of the two option periods set forth in section 9.5 to elect to purchase all or part of the interest in the partnership of the transferor partner not purchased pursuant to the first option, at the offer price or, if there is no written offer, at the transfer price. the interest in the partnership so purchased from a transferor partner, including the related partnership percentage and capital account, shall be allocated among all of the then remaining partners, who shall succeed to such interest as an interest of the same class held by such remaining partners. in the event a transferor partner has given notice of his intention to sell his entire interest in the partnership without a written offer, it being the transferor partner's intention to withdraw from the partnership, the exercise of the second option shall be mandatory with respect to any portion of the transferor partner's interest in the partnership not purchased pursuant to the first option, and the partnership shall exercise its second option with respect to any portion of the transferor partner's interest in the partnership not purchased pursuant to the first option. 9.7 exercise of entire option. in the event that the transferor partner has given notice of a written offer, then, if the option to purchase all of the subject interest is not exercised pursuant to the first option and the second option, the transferor 28 29 partner shall no longer be under an obligation to sell such interest pursuant to the first option and the second option and, during the ninety (90) day period following the termination of the second option, the transferor partner may sell the offered interest to the permitted transferee making the written offer at the offer price or on other terms no more favorable than the terms contained in the written offer. no transfer may be consummated after such ninety (90) day period or on terms more favorable than those set forth in the written offer without first again complying with this section 9. any permitted transferee who acquires an interest in the partnership pursuant to this section 9 shall become a party hereto and be subject to the terms of this agreement. 9.8 terms of purchase. any interest in the partnership to be sold pursuant to the first option or the second option shall be purchased at the price provided in section 9.5 or section 9.6 hereof, as the case may be. subject to section 9.12 hereof, the closing of the purchase and sale shall take place at the partnership's office within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable option periods. notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in a written offer and subject to the provisions of section 9.9 hereof, payment for the interest in the partnership purchased pursuant to the first option or the second option shall be made in ten (10) equal installments of principal. the first installment shall be made contemporaneously with the transfer and each succeeding payment shall be made on the annual anniversary date thereof. the partnership or any partner 29 30 purchasing an interest of the transferor partner may, however, prepay all or part of the purchase price at the time of the transfer or at any time thereafter without premium or penalty. each deferred payment shall bear interest at the lesser of eight percent (8%) per annum or the prime or base rate of interest charged by the first national bank of chicago. said rate of interest shall be determined at the time of transfer and shall be adjusted on each annual anniversary date thereof. in no event, however, shall the rate of interest be less than the applicable federal rate determined at the time of the transfer. 9.9 maximum obligation of the partnership. if the partnership purchases the interest of one or more transferor partners pursuant to the second option, the partnership shall not be obligated to pay, in the aggregate in any calendar year, pursuant to section 9.8 hereof an aggregate amount exceeding the greater of (a) the annual dividends received by the partnership with respect to the stock or (b) two percent (2%) of the partnership value (the "redemption cap"). if, as a result of the application of the redemption cap, amounts otherwise due are not paid to a transferor partner, such unpaid amounts shall be due and payable in the following year; provided, however, that the redemption cap as determined in the following year shall continue to limit the aggregate obligation of the partnership during such year so that any unpaid amounts continue to be deferred until such time as the total payments to transferor partners during a year are 30 31 within the redemption cap determined for such year. in the event that there are two (2) or more transferor partners at any one time and the payments due from the partnership to the transferor partners exceed the redemption cap, then payments to such transferor partners shall be reduced proportionately, from time to time and at any time, based on the outstanding principal owed to each transferor partner. 9.10 admission of partners. except as otherwise provided in section 9.2, no additional partners shall be admitted to the partnership without first obtaining the written consent of all partners. notwithstanding the foregoing, no additional partner shall be admitted to the partnership unless at the time that the proposed additional partner is to be admitted to the partnership (a) the partnership is a permitted transferee of such proposed additional partner and (b) the addition to the partnership of such proposed additional partner would not cause the partnership to cease being a permitted transferee of any or all of the then partners of the partnership. upon the admission of an additional partner, all references in this agreement to the partners shall be deemed to include the new partner. the partners shall determine what rights and voice an additional partner shall have in the management and conduct of the partnership. 9.11 distribution of a partner's interest. the termination of any trust which is a partner shall not terminate the partnership. upon the allocation or distribution of all or any portion of the 31 32 partnership interest of a trust which is a partner pursuant to the exercise of any power of appointment, or otherwise, to a beneficiary of such trust or to another person or persons or to another trust or trusts, whether or not such distribution shall terminate such distributing trust, each such distributee, notwithstanding the provisions hereof, shall become a partner hereunder to the extent of the proportionate share of the partnership interest distributed to him, subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, provided however, that such distributee must, in all events, be a permitted transferee. if any such intended distributee is not a permitted transferee, the trustee (or any other partner) shall give notice thereof to the managing partners, whereupon the partners and the partnership shall have the rights set forth in sections 9.5 and 9.6 hereof to purchase the interest in the partnership owned by the trust. 9.12 transfer date restrictions. notwithstanding anything in this article 9 to the contrary, no transfer, acquisition or redemption of an interest in the partnership shall be made and no adjustment to the partners' interests in the partnership shall be effective, and no transferee of an interest in the partnership shall be admitted as a partner, during any period between the record date and payment date of a dividend declared to be paid with respect to shares of the stock. any such purported transfer, acquisition or redemption shall be effective and reflected in the books of the partnership on and as of the first day following the dividend payment date. 32 33 10. withdrawal, death or bankruptcy of a partner. 10.1 withdrawal. any partner, including a trust which is a partner hereunder, shall have the right to withdraw from the partnership at any time upon giving notice thereof in writing to the managing partners pursuant to section 9.4 hereof, and the provisions of section 9 hereof shall be applicable. in the event of such withdrawal, the partnership shall not be wound up or liquidated and the withdrawing partner shall not have the right to compel liquidation of the partnership. the payments to the withdrawing partner pursuant to section 9 hereof shall be in lieu of any amount payable pursuant to section 42 of the uniform partnership act including any interest or profits payable pursuant to that section. 10.2 death of a partner. upon the death of a partner during the term of the partnership, the partnership business shall not be wound up or terminated, but shall be continued by the remaining partners. the executor or administrator (the "personal representative") of the estate of the deceased partner, notwithstanding section 9 hereof, shall immediately succeed to the interest of the deceased partner in the partnership, and such personal representative shall have the same rights and obligations in the partnership as the deceased partner would have had had he survived (such rights and obligations shall include, but shall not be limited to, rights to participate in the conduct of partnership business and to share in the profits and losses of the partnership) except that, if the deceased partner was a managing partner, the 33 34 personal representative shall not have the right to become a managing partner. the personal representative shall, if at all possible, transfer its interest to a permitted transferee and, to the extent that transfer to a permitted transferee is not possible, shall, promptly upon discovery thereof, give notice to the partnership pursuant to section 9.4 hereof of its intention to withdraw from the partnership. the personal representative shall not have the right to compel liquidation of the partnership. the rights of the personal representative set forth in this section 10.2 and the payments, if any, to a personal representative that withdraws from the partnership are in lieu of any amount payable pursuant to section 42 of the uniform partnership act including any interest or profits payable pursuant thereto. 10.3 bankruptcy, etc. in the event the interest of a partner in the partnership shall be attached or taken in execution, or in the event a partner shall be adjudicated a bankrupt or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or in the event its interest is made subject to a charging order, the partnership shall not be wound up or terminated and the partnership's business shall be continued, except that upon notice thereof to that partner, the other partners and the partnership shall have the rights set forth in sections 9.5 and 9.6 hereof to purchase the interest in the partnership of such partner. 34 35 11. dissolution and liquidation. the dissolution of the partnership shall occur as provided in section 4 hereof; provided, however, if an event specified in section 4 hereof occurs, the partners may, within sixty (60) days of the date such event occurs, unanimously vote to continue the partnership business, in which case the partnership shall continue thereafter as agreed to by the partners. unless otherwise provided herein or otherwise agreed by all of the partners, upon dissolution of the partnership, the partnership shall be terminated and the remaining managing partners shall become the liquidating trustees. the liquidating trustees shall take full account of the partnership's assets and liabilities and the receivables of the partnership shall be collected and its assets liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair market value therefor. if the liquidating trustees reasonably determine that it would be in the best interests of the partners to do so, all or any portion of the assets of the partnership shall be distributed in kind. the proceeds from the liquidation of the assets of the partnership and collection of the partnership's receivables, together with the property distributed in kind, to the extent sufficient therefor, shall be applied and distributed in the following order of priority: (a) to the payment and discharge of all of the partnership's debts and liabilities, except (i) the claims of secured creditors whose obligations will be assumed or otherwise transferred on the liquidation of partnership assets 35 36 and (ii) the payment of all debts and liabilities of the partnership due to the partners; (b) to the payment of all debts and
