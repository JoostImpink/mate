(the "company"), a maryland corporation. the principal executive offices of the company are located at 10270 old columbia road, columbia, maryland 21046. item 2. identity and background. this schedule 13d is being filed by nemetschek aktiengesellshaft ("nemetschek"), a german corporation. nemetschek is a vendor of information technology and consulting services for the design, construction and management of buildings and real estate. the principal offices of nemetschek are located at riedenburger strasse 2, d-81677 munich, germany. schedule a hereto sets forth the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment (including the name, principal business and address of the corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted) and citizenship of each director and executive officer of nemetschek. the information set forth in schedule a hereto is incorporated herein by reference. during the past five years, neither nemetschek nor, to the best of its knowledge, any of the persons listed on schedule a attached hereto, has (i) been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was, or is, subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. on february 18, 2000, nemetschek, dgi acquisition corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of nemetschek, and the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"). the merger agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 1. as a condition to, and in consideration of, nemetschek's execution of the merger agreement, nemetschek and richard diehl, president of the company, entered into the support/voting agreement, dated as of february 18, 2000 (the "support agreement"). the support agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 2. pursuant to the support agreement, richard diehl, among other things, granted to nemetschek an option (the "option") to purchase, on the terms and conditions expressed therein and upon the occurrence of certain events, a number of shares equal to 30% of the company's outstanding common stock, which percentage currently equates to 917,011 shares of the common stock. if nemetschek were to exercise the option, the purchase price for the shares of common stock covered thereby would be the option price equal to the greater of (i) the merger consideration (as defined in the merger agreement) or (ii) the average trading price of the 4 of 12 common stock during the five day period immediately prior to the exercise of the option, which average shall be reduced by 50% of the difference between the value of the merger consideration and such average trading price. if nemetschek elects to exercise the option, it currently anticipates that the funds necessary to pay the purchase price therefor would be provided by the working capital of nemetschek. the remaining 60,400 shares of common stock covered by this report were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $454,747, which funds were provided by the working capital of nemetschek. item 4. purpose of transaction. as noted herein, the option was granted to nemetschek in connection with the execution of the merger agreement. under the merger agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions stated therein (including approval by the stockholders of the company), dgi acquisition corp. will be merged with and into the company, with the company remaining as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of nemetschek (the "merger"). in the merger, each issued and outstanding share of the common stock, other than those shares owned by nemetschek or the company, shall be converted into the right to receive $9.50 cash. if the merger is consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the board of directors of the company following the merger shall consist of those directors who were directors of dgi acquisition corp. immediately prior to the merger. the officers of the company immediately prior to the merger shall continue as the officers of the company following the merger. the option can be exercised following the occurrence of a purchase event (as defined in the support agreement) provided certain actions are taken. a purchase event has not occurred as of the date hereof. the option is not presently exercisable and, accordingly, nemetschek has no present plan or proposal to purchase the common stock through the exercise of the option. if the option becomes exercisable through the occurrence of a purchase event, nemetschek will evaluate the facts and circumstances then existing to determine when, and if, it will purchase any shares of the common stock pursuant to the exercise of the option. under the terms of the merger agreement, the company has agreed to certain limitations on its ability to declare or pay dividends or make other distributions without nemetschek's prior written consent prior to the consummation of the merger. the remaining 60,400 shares of common stock were purchased for investment purposes. the preceding discussion of the merger agreement and the support agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such documents which are filed as exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. 5 of 12 item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. nemetschek may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 977,411 shares of the common stock, 917,011 of which are represented by the option. such shares represent approximately 32% of the outstanding shares of the common stock. nemetschek has sole voting and investment power with respect to 60,400 shares of common stock, and if the option is exercised, will have sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares as well. nothing herein shall be deemed to be an admission by nemetschek as to the beneficial ownership of 917,011 shares of the common stock subject to the option, and, prior to exercise of the option, nemetschek disclaims beneficial ownership of all such shares. schedule b attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference provides additional information relating to nemetschek's ownership of 60,400 shares of common stock, which were purchased through open-market transactions. except as described herein and on schedule b attached hereto, neither nemetschek nor, to the best of nemetschek's knowledge, any other person referred to in schedule a attached hereto, beneficially owns or has acquired or disposed of any shares of the common stock during the past 60 days. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, nemetschek entered into the support agreement with richard diehl, pursuant to which mr. diehl has agreed, in his capacity as a stockholder of the company, (i) not to transfer, or to allow any person controlled by him to transfer, any of the shares of the common stock without the written consent of nemetschek and (ii) to vote or cause to be voted all of the shares of common stock over which he or any of his affiliates has voting power or control in favor of the merger and the merger agreement, except in each case under certain circumstances specified in the support agreement. except for the merger agreement and the support agreement and as otherwise described in this item 6, nemetschek and none of the persons named on schedule a has any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with any persons with respect to any securities of the company. item 7. material to be filed as
