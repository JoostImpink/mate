merger agreement &#148;), with clinical data, fl holding and magnolia. in connection with the merger agreement, fl holding and magnolia also entered into the securityholder tender and support agreement, dated as of february 22, 2011 (the &#147; support agreement &#148;). pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, magnolia will commence a tender offer (the &#147; offer &#148;) to acquire (i) all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of clinical data (&#147; clinical data common stock &#148;) for (a) $30.00 per share of clinical data common stock (the &#147; upfront payment &#148;), net to the holder thereof in cash and less any withholding taxes, and (b) a non-transferable contractual right to receive one or more contingent payments, of up to $6.00 per share of clinical data common stock in total, upon the achievement of certain milestones (the &#147; contingent consideration &#148;), pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the contingent value right agreement described below, (ii) all of the outstanding warrants to purchase shares of clinical data common stock that have exercise prices of $36.00 per share of clinical data common stock or less (&#147; clinical data warrants &#148;) for the consideration set forth in the merger agreement, and (iii) all of the outstanding convertible promissory notes (&#147; clinical data notes &#148;) issued by clinical data on february 25, 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $50,000,000, for the consideration set forth in the merger agreement. as soon as practicable after the consummation of the offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement, magnolia will merge with and into clinical data (the &#147; merger &#148;) and clinical data will become a wholly owned subsidiary of fl holding. the merger agreement also provides that if the offer is not completed, the merger may be able to be consummated if the stockholders of clinical data adopt the merger agreement at a meeting of such stockholders (the &#147; one-step merger &#148;). in the merger, each outstanding share of clinical data common stock, other than shares of clinical data common stock owned by clinical data, fl holding, magnolia or any of their respective subsidiaries or by clinical data stockholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under delaware law, will be converted into the right to receive the consideration per share of clinical data common stock that would have been payable in the offer. in addition, in the merger, clinical data warrants and clinical data notes will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the consideration that would have been paid for them in the offer. the obligation of magnolia to purchase shares of clinical data common stock, clinical data warrants and clinical data notes tendered in the offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, the obtainment of any governmental approvals that may be required, and the consummation of the offer or the merger not being made unlawful under applicable laws or prohibited by any court of competent jurisdiction, and other customary closing conditions. in addition, it is a condition to magnolia&#146;s obligation to purchase the shares of clinical data common stock, clinical data warrants and clinical data notes tendered in the offer that the number of shares of clinical data common stock, clinical data warrants and clinical data notes that have been tendered and not validly withdrawn, together with any shares of clinical data common stock beneficially owned by fl holding and its affiliates plus the number of shares of cusip no. 18725u109 schedule 13d page 11 of 20 clinical data common stock issued or issuable pursuant to the top-up option (as described below), equals at least one more than 90% of the total number of shares of clinical data common stock outstanding as of the expiration of the offer calculated on a fully diluted basis plus the number of shares of clinical data common stock issued or issuable pursuant to the top-up option (the &#147; minimum condition &#148;). in the event that the conditions to the offer, including the minimum condition, are not met, the parties have agreed to complete the merger without the prior completion of the offer, after receipt of the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding clinical data common stock for the adoption of the merger agreement. in that case, the consummation of the merger would be subject to similar conditions as the conditions to the offer, other than the addition of the stockholder approval requirement and the inapplicability of the minimum condition. clinical data has also granted to fl holding and magnolia an option (the &#147; top-up option &#148;), which may be exercised by fl holding or magnolia, or at the request of clinical data, shall be exercised by fl holding or magnolia, following the consummation of the offer, to purchase from clinical data, subject to the total number of authorized shares, the number of shares of clinical data common stock that, when added to the number of outstanding shares of clinical data common stock owned by magnolia at the time of the exercise of the top-up option, constitutes one more than 90% of the number of shares of clinical data common stock that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of clinical data common stock subject to the top-up option calculated on a fully diluted basis (disregarding, however, any shares of clinical data common stock issuable upon conversion of clinical data notes or exercise of clinical data warrants acquired by magnolia in the offer). if fl holding, magnolia and any of their respective affiliates acquire more than 90% of the outstanding shares of clinical data common stock, including through exercise of the top-up option, fl holding will cause the merger to become effective as soon as practicable without a meeting of clinical data&#146;s stockholders in accordance with delaware law, including by means of the &#147;short form&#148; procedures available under delaware law. the merger agreement prohibits clinical data from soliciting or initiating discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire clinical data and clinical data has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to respond to such proposals, subject to the fulfillment of certain fiduciary requirements of clinical data&#146;s board of directors under delaware law. the merger agreement contains certain termination rights for fl holding and clinical data including, with respect to clinical data, in the event that clinical data receives a superior proposal (as defined in the merger agreement). in connection with the termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, including with respect to clinical data&#146;s entry into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, clinical data is required to pay to fl holding a termination fee equal to $45,000,000. in addition, in the event that the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances during the pendency of a publicly disclosed third party proposal to acquire clinical data, clinical data is required to reimburse fl holding for fl holding&#146;s fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement, the offer and the merger up to an aggregate amount of $7,500,000, and, if clinical data enters into an agreement for a third party to acquire clinical data within 12 months of such termination, to pay to fl holding the balance of the $45,000,000 termination fee less any such reimbursed expenses. the merger agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for transactions of this type. the merger agreement is attached to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about the forest group or clinical data in forest&#146;s or clinical data&#146;s respective public reports filed with the sec. in particular, the merger agreement and this summary of terms are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts or circumstances relating to forest or its subsidiaries or clinical data. the representations and warranties set forth in the merger agreement were negotiated with the principal purposes of (i) establishing the circumstances under which magnolia may have the right not to consummate the offer or the merger, or fl holding or clinical data may have the right to terminate the merger agreement, and (ii) allocating risk between the parties if those representations and warranties should prove to be inaccurate, rather than as statements of fact. the assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the merger agreement among clinical data, forest, fl holding and magnolia and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by clinical data, forest, fl holding and magnolia in connection with the negotiated terms thereof. moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date and may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable under federal securities laws. clinical data&#146;s stockholders and other investors are not third party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of clinical data, forest, fl holding, magnolia or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. cusip no. 18725u109 schedule 13d page 12 of 20 support agreement concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, fl holding and magnolia entered into the support agreement with the supporting stockholders, pursuant to which the supporting stockholders have agreed to tender, and not withdraw, all outstanding shares beneficially owned by them, or acquired by them after such date, and all clinical data warrants and clinical data notes beneficially owned by them (collectively, &#147; subject securities &#148;) in the offer no later than seven (7) business days after receipt by such supporting stockholder of all documents or instruments required to be delivered pursuant to the terms of the offer. the support agreement also provides that the supporting stockholders, if their subject securities have not been previously accepted for payment pursuant to the offer, will, at any meeting of clinical data&#146;s stockholders (or in connection with any written consent of such stockholders), vote or cause to be voted any outstanding shares of clinical data common stock owned by them (i) in favor of (a) the adoption of the merger agreement, and (b) without limiting the preceding clause (a), the approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such stockholders&#146; meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes for adoption of the merger agreement on the date on which such stockholders&#146; meeting is held, and (ii) against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially impede, hinder, interfere with, prevent, delay or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including any agreement or arrangement related to an acquisition proposal by a third party, as described in the merger agreement (an &#147; acquisition proposal &#148;). in furtherance of the supporting stockholders&#146; covenants under the support agreement, the supporting stockholders agreed to appoint parent as their attorney-in-fact and proxy to attend all meetings of clinical data&#146;s stockholders, and to vote such outstanding shares of clinical data common stock owned by them in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and against the actions described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence (or grant or withhold a written consent in connection therewith). each supporting stockholder agreed that neither it nor any of its affiliated investment funds or vehicles will, nor will such supporting stockholder or any of its affiliated investment funds or vehicles authorize or permit any of its or their respective officers, directors or employees to, and each supporting stockholder will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its affiliated investment funds and vehicles respective investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors, acting on behalf of such supporting stockholder, not to, directly or indirectly, (i) submit, solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any acquisition proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an acquisition proposal, or furnish any information relating to clinical data or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of clinical data or any of its subsidiaries to any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, an acquisition proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, purchase agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an acquisition proposal. the support agreement limits the ability of the supporting stockholders to sell or otherwise transfer, encumber or grant any proxies in respect of their subject securities. the support agreement will terminate upon certain circumstances, including upon termination of the merger agreement or upon notice by parent. as of february 22, 2011, the supporting stockholders beneficially owned a total of 11,271,500 outstanding shares of clinical data common stock, representing approximately 36.4% of all shares of clinical data common stock outstanding as of february 17, 2011, and beneficially owned clinical data warrants exercisable for 3,824,011 shares and clinical data notes convertible into 6,110,599 shares of clinical data common stock. as of february 22, 2011, the supporting stockholders beneficially owned a total of 24,038,056 shares of clinical data common stock calculated on a fully diluted basis (including for this purpose all options to purchase shares, whether vested or unvested), representing approximately 52.4% of all shares of clinical data common stock as of february 17, 2011 calculated on the same fully diluted basis. the support agreement does not require that the supporting stockholders exercise their options to purchase shares of clinical data common stock, though if exercised, such shares would become subject to the support agreement and would be required to be tendered in the offer and, to the extent necessary, voted in favor of the merger. cusip no. 18725u109 schedule 13d page 13 of 20 contingent value right agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the consummation of the offer or the merger, fl holding and forest will enter into a contingent value right agreement (the &#147; cvr agreement &#148;) with a bank or trustee mutually acceptable to fl holding and clinical data governing the terms of the contingent consideration. the former holders of shares of clinical data common stock, deferred stock units and options to acquire shares of clinical data common stock, and the former holders of clinical data warrants and clinical data notes, will be entitled to receive the following cash payments for each share of clinical data common stock acquired by magnolia in the offer or converted into the right to receive merger consideration in the merger (or, in the case of deferred stock units and options to acquire shares of clinical data common stock, and clinical data warrants and clinical data notes, each share of clinical data common stock that would have been issuable upon the exercise or conversion thereof), with each payment conditioned upon the achievement of the applicable milestone related to the commercialization of viibryd&#153; as follows: &#149; milestone #1. fl holding will be obligated to pay $1.00 in the event that the aggregate net sales of viibryd&#153; (or any other product containing vilazodone hydrochloride) in the united states in any four consecutive calendar quarters occurring between the merger and the fifth anniversary of the merger equal or exceed a total of $800,000,000. &#149; milestone #2. fl holding will be obligated to pay $2.00 in the event that the aggregate net sales of viibryd&#153; (or any other product containing vilazodone hydrochloride) in the united states in any four consecutive calendar quarters occurring between the merger and the sixth anniversary of the merger equal or exceed $1,100,000,000. &#149; milestone #3. fl holding will be obligated to pay $3.00 in the event that aggregate net sales of viibryd&#153; (or any other product containing vilazodone hydrochloride) in the united states in any four consecutive calendar quarters occurring between the merger and the seventh anniversary of the merger equal or exceed a total of $1,500,000,000. the five, six and seven year periods described above may be extended in the event that the commercial launch of viibryd&#153; occurs more than six months after the completion of the merger in certain circumstances. the terms of the contingent consideration described above reflect the parties&#146; agreement over the sharing of potential economic upside benefits from future net sales of viibryd&#153; or other products containing vilazodone hydrochloride in the united states and do not necessarily reflect anticipated sales of the product. there can be no assurance that such levels of net sales will occur or that any or all of the contingent consideration payments will be made. the right to the contingent consideration as evidenced by the cvr agreement is a contractual right only and will not be transferable, except in the limited circumstances specified in the cvr agreement. (c) - (d) - (e) - (f) - (g) upon the consummation of the offer and the merger, the forest group intends to integrate the operations of the clinical data business into the operations of the forest group generally. magnolia currently intends that no dividends will be declared on the clinical data common stock prior to the acquisition of the entire equity interest in clinical data. (h) upon consummation of the merger, the clinical data common stock will be delisted from and no longer be quoted on the nasdaq capital market.
