contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. on june 24, 2011, the issuer entered into the investment agreement, which was amended and restated on july 14, 2011, pursuant to which, on the closing date, the issuer issued an aggregate of 41,155,686 shares of common stock to the pf v fund and 8,591,306 shares of common stock to the aif fund. for further information, see item 4, which are incorporated herein by reference. under the investment agreement, the issuer agreed to file as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 90 days after the closing date, a registration statement under the securities act of 21 cusip no. 318672102 schedule 13d 1933 to register the resale of the shares.&#160; in addition, the investors are entitled to piggyback registration rights in respect of the shares. the investors are entitled to designate a person to serve on the issuer&#146;s board of directors and another person to attend meetings of the issuer&#146;s board of directors and board committees as an observer for as long as the investors continue to own in the aggregate at least 25% of the number of shares acquired on the closing date (the &#147; qualifying ownership interest &#148;).&#160; the investors have designated michael harmon as their representative to the issuer&#146;s board of directors.&#160; for as long as the investors own the qualifying ownership interest, the investors are entitled to:&#160; (i) acquire from the issuer at such time as the issuer sells any common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or include a common stock component up to the amount of the new securities required to maintain such investor&#146;s proportionate ownership interest in the issuer prior to the issuance of the new securities; and (ii) acquire from the issuer at such time as the issuer offers or sells any common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or include a common stock component, to any other investor that acquired common stock on the closing date or its affiliates, for the same price and on the same terms as such other offer or sale, up to the amount of new securities equal to the aggregate amount of new securities that the issuer offers to sell to such other investor or its affiliates.&#160; in addition, for as long as the investors own in the aggregate at least as many shares of common stock as any other entity or group of affiliated entities, if the issuer offers to sell to any entity or group of affiliated entities common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or include a common stock component, that would cause that entity or group of affiliated entities to own more shares of common stock than the investors, the issuer agrees to offer to sell to the investors, for the same price and on the same terms, a number of new securities such that the investors will own an amount of shares of common stock, after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of such new securities into common stock, equal to the number of shares of common stock owned by such other entity or group of affiliated entities. in connection with the investment in the issuer, the reporting persons and certain of their affiliates made customary passivity and anti-association commitments (the &#147; commitments &#148;) to the board of governors of the federal reserve system to ensure that the reporting persons and such affiliates will not, among other things, be deemed to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries for purposes of the bank holding company act of 1956. the commitments are attached hereto as exhibit 3 and are incorporated herein by reference. except as described above and elsewhere in this schedule 13d, as of the date hereof, there are no other contracts, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the parties named in item 2 hereto and between such persons and any person with respect to any of the shares. the foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the investment agreement and the commitments filed herewith as exhibit 2 and exhibit 3, respectively. item 7. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
