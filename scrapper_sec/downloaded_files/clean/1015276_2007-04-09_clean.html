under the laws of the grand duchy of luxembourg (&#147;ses&#148;), ge cfe luxembourg s. &agrave; r.l., a company with limited liability organized and existing under the laws of the grand duchy of luxembourg (&#147;cfe&#148;), ge capital equity holdings inc., a delaware corporation (&#147;gceh&#148;) and for the purpose of section 6.23, general electric capital corporation, a delaware corporation (&#147;parent&#148;). w i t n e s s e t h: whereas, ses and certain of its subsidiaries, collectively, currently own the amc-23 business and the equity interests (as such terms are defined in article 1); whereas , on or prior to the closing (as defined in section 2.2), ses shall complete the reorganization (as defined in section 3.7), pursuant to which the equity interests, the amc-23 transferred assets (as defined in section 3.2), the amc-23 assumed liabilities (as defined in section 3.4) and the cash amount (as defined in article 1) will be transferred into splitco (as defined in article 1) in accordance with this agreement, and immediately after the closing the equity interests, the amc-23 transferred assets, the amc-23 assumed liabilities and the cash amount will be owned solely by splitco; whereas , upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement, (a) ses desires to redeem the class c shares (as defined in article 1) for consideration in kind consisting of the splitco shares (as defined in article 1), and (b) the ge entities (as defined in article 1) desire to have ses redeem the class c shares for consideration in kind consisting of the splitco shares; whereas , the parties hereto intend the redemption (as defined in section 2.1) to qualify as a tax-free exchange under section 355(a) of the code (as defined in article 1); whereas , the board of directors of ses is motivated to effectuate the redemption for the following business purposes of ses: (a) following the acquisition of new skies satellites holdings ltd. on march 30, 2006, (i) to restructure and optimize ses&#146;s business assets and its portfolio of shareholdings in satellite system owners and operators, (ii) to refocus its satellite service activities to match its intended market positioning, and (iii) to accomplish the restructuring and optimization in a single transaction in such a manner that maximizes the value of the business assets and participation interests; and (b) to remove the market overhang (being the negative effect on the ses shares trading price which ses believes resulted from the ge entities&#146; announcement in 2005 that the ge entities intended to divest from their participation in ses through periodic sales at a set price (and the ge entities&#146; subsequent sales at or around that price) in order to meaningfully facilitate ses&#146;s acquisition strategy during the overhang period (being the period which the market overhang would last beyond the anticipated date of the redemption if the redemption were not to occur); and, in consideration of the foregoing, a committee of ses duly appointed by the board of directors of ses and authorized to act on behalf of the board of directors of ses has approved this agreement and the transactions contemplated by this agreement; and 1 whereas , the boards of directors of parent and each of the ge entities has, in each case, determined that it is in the best interests of their respective company to enter into this agreement and have each approved this agreement and the transactions contemplated by this agreement. now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this agreement, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: article 1. certain definitions and other matters section 1.1 certain definitions. as used in this agreement and the schedules hereto, the following terms have the respective meanings set forth below. &#147;actual satellite operational capability&#148; means, as measured from any date, the reasonable forecast of the total number of remaining 30-day periods until the end of expected life for each transponder on such satellite taking into account all known and reasonably likely transponder unit failures. &#147;affiliate&#148; means, with respect to any person, any other person that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such person. the term &#147;control&#148; means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, including the ability to elect the members of the board of directors or other governing body of a person, and the terms &#147;controlled&#148; and &#147;controlling&#148; have correlative meanings. for purposes of this agreement, (i) the ge entities shall be deemed not to be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of ses or any of its subsidiaries and ses or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed not to be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of the ge entities; provided, however , that prior to the closing, the transferred entities shall be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of ses and not of the ge entities and, following the closing, the transferred entities shall be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of the ge entities and not of ses; and (ii) star one, orbcomm inc., bowenvale and asiasat and their respective subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be &#147;affiliates&#148; of ses or any of its subsidiaries. &#147;aggregate reference

claim made by any person (other than any party hereto or any of its affiliates) against the indemnified party (a &#147;third party claim&#148;), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable) of the third party claim within 10 business days after receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the third party claim; provided, however , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the indemnified party failed to give such notice). thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five (5) business days&#146; time after the indemnified party&#146;s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the third party claim. 86 (b) assumption . if a third party claim is made against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof, at its own expense, with counsel selected by the indemnifying party; provided, however , that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party. should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a third party claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. if the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. the indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of one counsel and one local counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the indemnified party shall have failed to give notice of the third party claim as provided above). if the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a third party claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses therefor (other than the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party, which are governed by the second preceding sentence in this section 10.6(b)). such cooperation shall include the retention, and (upon the indemnifying party&#146;s request) the provision to the indemnifying party, of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such third party claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a third party claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge or consent to the entry of any judgment for, such third party claim without the indemnifying party&#146;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). if the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a third party claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a third party claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such third party claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such third party claim and that would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party. notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any third party claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel and one local counsel incurred by the indemnified party in defending such third party claim) if the third party claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the indemnified party that the indemnified party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the indemnified party, there is a conflict of interest between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, then the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any third party claim until it executes a joint defense agreement with the indemnified party in form reasonably satisfactory to both parties. if such equitable relief or other relief portion of the third party claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages. 87 (c) other claims . in the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying party under section 10.2 or 10.3 that does not involve a third party claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such claim, with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party after obtaining actual knowledge thereof. subject to sections 10.5 and 10.1, the failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to such indemnified party under section 10.2 or 10.3, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the indemnifying party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the indemnified party and in otherwise resolving such matters. (d) mitigation . ses and the ge entities shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify another party hereunder, including by making reasonable best efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. in the event that ses, on the one hand, or the ge entities, on the other hand, shall have failed to make such reasonable best efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify any person for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense that is reasonably expected to have been avoided if such first party had made such efforts. section 10.7 assignment of claims. if any indemnified party of the ge entities (a &#147;ge indemnified party&#148;) receives any payment from ses in respect of any losses pursuant to section 10.2 and the ge indemnified party could have recovered all or a part of such losses from a third party (a &#147;potential contributor&#148;) based on the underlying claim asserted against ses, the ge indemnified party shall assign, on a non-recourse basis and without any representation or warranty, such of its rights to proceed against the potential contributor as are necessary to permit ses to recover from the potential contributor the amount of such payment. if any such assignment would afford the potential contributor any defense to the payment of the same, such assignment shall not take place and the ge indemnified party will, at ses&#146;s direction and expense, take all reasonable actions to seek to recover such claim from such potential contributor. any payment received in respect of such claim against the potential contributor (whether by ses or the relevant ge indemnified party as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) shall be distributed, (i) first, to the ge indemnified party in the amount of any deductible or similar amount required to be paid by the ge indemnified party prior to ses being required to make any payment to the ge indemnified party plus, in the case of any claim by a ge indemnified party as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or otherwise addressing such claim, (ii) second, to ses in an amount equal to the aggregate payments made by ses to the ge indemnified party in respect of such claim, plus the costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or otherwise addressing such claim and (iii) the balance, if any, to the ge indemnified party. section 10.8 additional limitations on indemnification. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement: (a) ses shall not be obligated to indemnify any indemnified party with respect to any losses to the extent that a specific accrual or reserve for the amount of such loss was reflected on the amc-23 balance sheet, the leuk balance sheet or the satlynx balance sheet; 88 (b) no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this agreement, in each case other than any such damages paid or payable to a third party in connection with a third party claim. section 10.9 supplementation and amendment of the disclosure schedules. from time to time prior to the closing, ses shall have the right to supplement or amend the disclosure schedules with respect to any matter related to star one, asiasat or their respective subsidiaries hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery of the disclosure schedules pursuant to this agreement. no such supplement or amendment shall have any effect on the satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth in section 8.2(a) and section 8.2(d); provided, however , if the closing shall occur, then the ge entities shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim pursuant to the terms of section 10.2(a)(i) of this agreement with respect to any and all matters disclosed pursuant to any such supplement or amendment at or prior to the closing. article 11. miscellaneous section 11.1 assignment. this agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by any party (including by operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation of such party) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. any attempted assignment in violation of this section 11.1 shall be void. section 11.2 no third-party beneficiaries. except as provided in article 10, this agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any person, other than the parties hereto and such assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder. nothing contained in this agreement shall be deemed or construed by the parties or by any third party to create the relationship of principal and agent, partnership or joint venture or any other fiduciary relationship or association between the parties. section 11.3 [reserved]. section 11.4 notices. all notices or other communications required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or sent by facsimile or sent, postage prepaid, by registered, certified or express mail, reputable overnight courier service or e-mail (with receipt acknowledged) and shall be deemed given when delivered personally or when so received by facsimile or courier or e-mail, or, if mailed, three (3) calendar days after the date of mailing received, as follows: 89 (i) if to ses: ch&acirc;teau de betzdorf l-6815 betzdorf grand duchy of luxembourg attention: general counsel facsimile: 352-710-725-532 with a copy to: gibson, dunn &amp;

vote according to the terms of the ads deposit agreement. please complete and return the ads voting instruction card to the ads depositary in a timely manner. if you hold your adss through a financial

&#147;definitions&#148; in appendix 2 to this scheme document. the distribution of this scheme document in jurisdictions other than hong kong may be restricted by law, and therefore persons into whose possession this scheme document comes should inform themselves about and observe such restrictions. any failure to comply with the restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. this scheme document and the conditions and further terms set out in this scheme document are governed by hong kong law and are subject to the jurisdiction of the hong kong courts. the scheme is subject to the laws of bermuda. this scheme document does not constitute an offer to sell or issue, or the solicitation of an offer to buy or subscribe, shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. no person has been authorised to give any information or to make any representation not contained in this scheme document and, if given or made, such information or representation should not be relied on as having been authorised by asiasat, the offeror or any of their respective affiliates. the delivery of this scheme document shall not imply that there has been no change in the information set forth herein or in the affairs of asiasat since the latest practicable date or that the information contained herein is correct as of any time after its date. information for us asiasat shareholders and ads holders the proposals are being made in relation to securities of asiasat, an exempted company incorporated in bermuda, the ordinary shares and adss of which are listed on the stock exchange and on the nyse respectively and, while the proposals are subject to bermuda, hong kong and us disclosure requirements, us investors should be aware that this scheme document has been prepared in accordance with a hong kong format and style, which differs from the us format and style. the financial information relating to asiasat has been extracted from the relevant audited consolidated financial statements of asiasat for the financial years ended 31 december 2004, 31 december 2005 and 31 december 2006, which have been prepared in accordance with hkfrs. even though such financial statements may contain a reconciliation of certain line items to us gaap, the financial information or statements may not be wholly comparable to financial information or statements of us companies or companies whose financial statements are solely prepared in accordance with us gaap. in addition, the settlement procedure with respect to the proposals will comply with the rules of the takeovers code and the companies act, which differ from us domestic settlement procedures in certain material respects, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration. asiasat is incorporated under the laws of bermuda, and the offeror is incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands, and some or all of the officers and directors of the offeror and asiasat, respectively, are residents of countries other than the united states. in addition, all of the assets of the offeror and all major assets of asiasat are located outside the united states. as a result, it may be difficult for us shareholders of asiasat to effect service of process within the united states upon the offeror or asiasat or their respective officers or directors or to enforce against them a judgement of a us court predicated upon the federal or state securities laws of the united states. in addition, pursuant to exemptive relief granted by the sec from rule 14e-5, the offeror, citic group, gecc, and any adviser, broker or other financial institution acting as one of their respective agents may make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, asiasat shares outside the united states during the period in which the share proposal and the possible mgo offers, if implemented, remain open (subject to certain conditions and limitations). in accordance with the requirements of rule 14e-5 and with the exemptive relief granted by the sec, such purchases, or arrangements to purchase, must comply with applicable hong kong and bermuda rules, including the companies act, the takeovers code and the listing rules. this information will be disclosed in the united states through amendments to the schedule 13e-3 on file with the sec to the extent that such information is made public in bermuda pursuant to the companies act or in hong kong pursuant to the takeovers code or the listing rules. free copies of the scheme document are available on the sec&#146;s website at http://www.sec.gov . the scheme document will also be available on asiasat&#146;s website at http://www.asiasat.com . iii important notices this scheme document (including the documents incorporated by reference in this scheme document) jointly issued by asiasat and the offeror includes certain &#147;forward-looking statements&#148;. these statements are based on the current expectations of the management of asiasat or the offeror and are naturally subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. the forward-looking statements contained herein include statements about the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objective, future performance and business as well as forward-looking statements relating to the expected effects on asiasat of the proposals and the possible mgo offers, the expected timing, conditions and scope of the proposals and the possible mgo offers, and all other statements in this scheme document other than historical facts. forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements typically containing words such as &#147;intends&#148;, &#147;expects&#148;, &#147;anticipates&#148;, &#147;targets&#148;, &#147;estimates&#148;, &#147;envisages&#148; and words of similar import. by their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. there may be events in the future that cannot be accurately predicted or over which asiasat and the offeror have no control. the risk factors listed in asiasat&#146;s annual report on form 20-f filed with the sec for the year ended 31 december 2005 and information subsequently submitted by asiasat to the sec under cover of forms 6-k as well as any other cautionary language in this scheme document, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause the actual results of asiasat or the timing or success of matters related to the scheme or the proposals to differ materially from the expectations described in forward-looking statements. the occurrence of the events described in those risk factors and the risk factors described below could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results or financial condition of asiasat or the timing or success of the scheme or proposals. there are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. these factors include, but are not limited to, the satisfaction of the conditions to the scheme, the proposals and the possible mgo offers, the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against asiasat and others relating to the scheme or the proposals, the effect of the announcement of the scheme on asiasat&#146;s customer relationships, operating results and business generally, the risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the scheme and the proposals that asiasat must bear as well as additional factors, such as changes in demand for satellite services, changes in economic conditions, operations of existing in orbit satellites and success in the planned construction and launch of new satellites, changes in the level of capital investment, success of business and operating initiatives and restructuring objectives, changes in the regulatory environment, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, the outcome of litigation, government actions and natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes. other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. for further discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations, you should read asiasat&#146;s filings and submissions to the sec, including asiasat&#146;s most recent annual report on form 20-f and other materials submitted to the sec under form 6-k. the factors identified above and the risks reflected in asiasat&#146;s most recent annual report on form 20-f and information subsequently submitted by asiasat to the sec under cover of forms 6-k should not be construed as exhaustive. asiasat and the offeror believe the forward-looking statements in this scheme document are reasonable; however, there is no assurance that the actions, events or results of the forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them do, what impact they will have on asiasat&#146;s results or operations or financial condition or on the scheme or the proposals. in addition, actual results or matters related to the privatisation could differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this scheme document as a result of the timing of the completion of the scheme and the proposals. in view of these uncertainties, the readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on asiasat&#146;s current expectations. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the offeror or asiasat or persons acting on behalf of either of them are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. the forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date of this scheme document. solely for the convenience of the reader, this scheme document includes convenience translations of the consideration to be paid by the offeror from hong kong dollars into us dollars. these translations should not be construed as representations that the hong kong dollar amounts actually represent such us dollar amounts or could be converted into us dollars at the rates indicated or at all. unless otherwise stated, all such amounts have been translated at the exchange rate of us$1.00 : hk$7.8108, the noon buying rate for hong kong dollars in new york in us$ for cable transfers payable in hk$ as certified by the new york federal reserve bank for customs purposes on the latest practicable date. any us dollar amounts actually to be paid to holders of the adss will be determined by the ads depositary. iv important notices rule 13e-3 notice this scheme document contains disclosures complying with the requirements of rule 13e-3 under the exchange act and schedule 13e-3, which rule governs so-called &#147;going private&#148; transactions by certain issuers or their affiliates. the company and the

supreme court and a special general meeting of asiasat shareholders is scheduled to be held immediately following the court meeting. at the court meeting and the special general meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal put forward by the offeror to privatise the company by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 99 of the companies act, to cancel all of the company&#146;s outstanding ordinary shares not already held by bowenvale, which will result in a reduction of the issued share capital of the company, and to issue the new asiasat shares to the offeror. the offeror has also proposed to acquire for cancellation, concurrently with the offeror&#146;s proposal to privatise the company, all of the outstanding options in the company. this summary term sheet highlights selected information contained in this scheme document and is intended to be an overview only. you are urged to read this entire document carefully, including the appendices. we have included references to direct you to other parts of this scheme document which contain a more complete description of the topics contained in this summary. capitalised terms used in this scheme document are defined under &#147;definitions&#148; in appendix 2. &#149; share proposal: the share proposal is a proposal to privatise the company by way of the scheme, to cancel all of the scheme shares (including without limitation the scheme shares underlying the adss), resulting in a reduction of the issued share capital of the company under the companies act, and to issue the new asiasat shares to the offeror. the effect will be that the offeror will hold all asiasat shares not held by bowenvale. see &#147;part iv &#150; letter from the board; 5. summary of the share proposal&#148; and &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 2.1. the share proposal&#148;. &#149; shareholder votes: the implementation of the scheme will require, among other things, the approval of the scheme shareholders at the court meeting and the approval of asiasat shareholders at the special general meeting. further details of the voting thresholds are set out in &#147;conditions to the scheme&#148; below. &#149; payment: pursuant to the share proposal, scheme shareholders will receive hk$18.30 in cash for each scheme share held. ads holders would be paid under the terms of the ads deposit agreement (based on the same per share price multiplied by ten, reflecting the number of asiasat shares underlying each ads) upon surrender of the adss (less any fees and expenses of the ads depositary in connection with currency conversions under the ads deposit agreement and withholding taxes, if applicable). see &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 18. registration and payment&#148;. &#149; premium prices: the share offer price and the equivalent offer price per ads offered under the proposals represents a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.00 per asiasat share on the pre-suspension date, a premium of 29.8 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.10 per asiasat share on the suspension date, a premium of 32.2 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price, and a discount of approximately 0.5 per cent to the closing price of us$23.55 per ads as quoted on the nyse on the latest practicable date. see &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 7.1 comparables&#148;. &#149; option proposal: the option proposal is an offer by the offeror to purchase for cancellation all options not exercised as of the scheme record time. the option proposal is subject to and conditional upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. the offeror is offering hk$0.82 in cash for each outstanding b option and hk$3.95 in cash for each outstanding c option. an optionholder may exercise b option(s) at hk$17.48 per asiasat share and c option(s) at hk$14.35 per asiasat share in accordance with the rules of the share option scheme. upon notice from the company (to be given on the same day as the notices to asiasat shareholders of the meetings), the optionholders shall be entitled to give notice to the company to exercise their options in full or in part from the date of such notice until the earlier of (i) two calendar months after the date of the notice, and (ii) the date on which the scheme is sanctioned by the supreme court, but the exercise of the options as described above shall be conditional upon the scheme becoming effective. asiasat shares issued upon exercise of the options prior to the scheme record time will form part of the scheme shares. see &#147;part iv &#150; letter from the board; 6. summary of the option proposal&#148; and &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 2.2 the option proposal&#148;. &#149; fairness of the proposals: the independent board committee, having considered the terms of the proposals and having taken into account the advice and recommendations of the independent financial adviser, considers that the terms of the share proposal and the option proposal are fair and reasonable 1 part i &#150; summary term sheet so far as the scheme shareholders, the ads holders and optionholders, respectively, are concerned. see &#147;part v &#150; letter from the independent board committee&#148;, &#147;part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee&#148; and &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors; 1.3 fairness&#148;. &#149; exchange transaction: the exchange transaction is a transaction pursuant to which gecc and ses have agreed that ses shall redeem gecc&#146;s entire indirect holding of ses shares (of approximately 19 per cent of the issued share capital of ses) in exchange for shares of a new company holding a number of assets and cash, including ses&#146;s entire shareholding in bowenvale. upon completion of the transfer, bowenvale will be jointly and indirectly owned by citic group (through able star) and the ge entities. the completion of the exchange transaction is one of the conditions to the share proposal, and is itself subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. the exchange transaction is not subject to the approval of scheme shareholders and asiasat shareholders. see &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 9. the exchange transaction&#148;. &#149; tax consequences for us holders: the receipt of cash for scheme shares in the transaction will be a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under applicable state, local, foreign or other tax laws. generally, us holders of scheme shares will recognise a gain or loss for these purposes equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and their adjusted tax basis for the scheme shares that were owned immediately before completion of the scheme. for us federal income tax purposes, this gain or loss generally would be a capital gain or loss if the scheme shares are held as a capital asset. a us optionholder who receives cash in cancellation of such options pursuant to the options proposal will generally recognise, as ordinary income for us federal income tax purposes, the cash payment received. see &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors; 2. tax consequences&#148;. tax matters are very complex, and the tax consequences of the scheme to you will depend on the facts of your own situation. it is recommended that you consult your tax adviser for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the scheme to you. &#149; conditions to the scheme: the scheme will become effective and binding on all scheme shareholders if the following conditions, as well as those described in &#147;conditions to the share proposal&#148; below, among others, are satisfied: (a) the approval by way of poll of the scheme by a majority in number of the scheme shareholders representing not less than three-fourths in value of the scheme shares, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the court meeting, provided that: (i) the scheme is approved by at least 75 per cent of the votes attaching to scheme shares held by scheme shareholders that are cast either in person or by proxy at the court meeting; and (ii) the number of votes cast against the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting is not more than 10 per cent of the votes attaching to all scheme shares held by scheme shareholders; (b) the passing by asiasat shareholders of a special resolution to approve and give effect to the scheme (including the cancellation of the scheme shares and the reduction of the relevant portion of the issued share capital of the company and the issue of the new asiasat shares) by a majority of not less than three-fourths of the votes cast by the asiasat shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy, at the special general meeting; and (c) the sanction of the scheme (with or without modifications) by the supreme court and the delivery to the registrar of companies in bermuda of a copy of the order of the supreme court for registration. for further detail regarding these and other conditions, please see &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 3. conditions of the proposals&#148;. &#149; conditions to the share proposal: the share proposal is subject to the following conditions, among others: &#150; the approval of the scheme, as described above at &#147;conditions to the scheme&#148; above; 2 part i &#150; summary term sheet &#150; the authorisation condition; &#150; the further authorisation condition; &#150; the consent condition; &#150; completion of the exchange transaction; and &#150; the mae condition. the offeror reserves the right to waive the consent condition, either in whole or in part, in respect of any particular matter. in the event that the authorisation condition and the further authorisation condition are not fulfilled by reason of an authorisation not having been obtained or maintained, the offeror reserves the right to assess the materiality of such non-fulfilment and to waive the fulfilment of such condition(s) to such extent where it considers appropriate. the offeror may only invoke the mae condition as a basis for not proceeding with the share proposal if the provisions of note 2 to rule 30.1 of the takeovers code are satisfied. note 2 to rule 30.1 of the takeovers code provides that an offeror should not invoke any condition (other than the acceptance condition) so as to cause the offer to lapse unless the circumstances which give rise to the right to invoke the condition are of material significance to the offeror in the context of the offer. the waiver or invoking by the offeror of any condition in accordance with the terms of this paragraph shall not be subject to the company&#146;s agreement, approval or consent. the offeror may not waive any other conditions in any event, and asiasat has no right to waive any of the conditions. all of the conditions will have to be fulfilled or waived, as applicable, on or before 30 june 2007 (or such later date as the offeror and asiasat may agree or (to the extent applicable) as the supreme court may direct and as may be permitted by the takeovers code), failing which the scheme will lapse. any extension to such later date shall not be beyond 31 october 2007. for further detail regarding these and other conditions, please see &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 3. conditions of the proposals&#148;. &#149; conditions to the option proposal: the option proposal is subject to and conditional upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. &#149; effect of completion: upon completion of the scheme, citic group and gecc will own indirectly through the jointly owned companies, bowenvale and the offeror (each of which will hold asiasat shares directly), 100 per cent of asiasat&#146;s issued share capital. on the effective date, the scheme shareholders will immediately cease to have any ownership interests in the company or rights as the company&#146;s shareholders, and, as a result, will not participate in any of asiasat&#146;s future earnings, losses, growth or decline. in addition, asiasat intends to have the listing of the asiasat shares on the stock exchange and the listing of the adss on the nyse terminated. if the scheme becomes effective and binding, the offeror intends to cause asiasat to file a form 15 with the sec to request that the company&#146;s reporting obligations under the exchange act be terminated or suspended, provided that the relevant rules and regulations of the sec are satisfied. as a result, public trading of the asiasat shares and the adss will cease. see &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors; 1.4 effects of proposals; 1.4.2 market for asiasat securities&#148;. &#149; no appraisal rights: asiasat shareholders do not have express appraisal rights in connection with the scheme under the companies act. see &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors; 1.4 effects of the proposals; 1.4.5 no appraisal rights&#148;. &#149; possible mgo offers : the possible mgo share offer and the possible mgo option offer are potential obligations on the part of able star and the ge entities to make a mandatory general offer for asiasat shares not owned by bowenvale or parties acting in concert with it. the executive has taken the view that the acquisition by the ge entities of ses&#146;s entire shareholding in bowenvale pursuant to the exchange transaction would, on completion, result in the formation of a new concert group that has statutory control over bowenvale, which would trigger an obligation under the takeovers code to make a mandatory general offer for asiasat. whilst the view taken by able star and ge equity is different from that of the executive, the offeror has indicated it is prepared to make the possible mgo offers in the event the transfer is completed. thus, if for any reason the scheme fails (for example because the requisite vote is not obtained) and the transfer completes, the possible mgo offers will proceed and scheme shareholders will have the opportunity to sell their scheme shares (including 3 part i &#150; summary term sheet shares underlying adss) or options, but for consideration that is less than that available if the scheme were to be effective. see &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 10. the possible mgo offers&#148; and &#147;part ix &#150; the possible mgo offers&#148;. &#149; material accounting treatment: upon cancellation of the scheme shares, asiasat&#146;s issued share capital will be reduced by hk$12,136,050, the par value of the asiasat shares cancelled. there will then be an immediate issue of new asiasat shares, so that the net effect on the share capital will be nil. see &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors; 1.4 effects of proposals; 1.4.6 material accounting treatment&#148;. 4 part ii &#150; questions and answers the following are some of the questions you, as an asiasat shareholder and/or ads holder, may have and the answers to those questions. you are advised to read carefully the remainder of this scheme document. capitalised terms used herein are defined under &#147;appendix 2 &#150; definitions&#148; to this scheme document. what is the purpose of this scheme document? the purpose of this scheme document is to give you further information regarding the share proposal and the option proposal and the expected timetable and to give you notice of the court meeting and the special general meeting. this scheme document does not constitute an offer to purchase asiasat shares in the possible mgo offers. who is making the proposals that we are to vote on? the offeror is asiaco acquisition ltd. (formerly known as modernday limited), a company incorporated in the british virgin islands with limited liability and owned jointly by able star and ge equity. the offeror has been established for the purpose of effecting the proposals and implementation of the possible mgo offers (if and when made) and has no other business activities. bowenvale is a company incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands with limited liability that currently owns approximately 68.9 per cent of the asiasat shares in issue. currently (prior to the completion of the exchange transaction), bowenvale is jointly indirectly owned by citic group (which holds a 50.5 per cent economic interest and 50 per cent voting interest in bowenvale) and ses (which holds a 49.5 per cent economic interest and 50 per cent voting interest in bowenvale). citic group is a conglomerate owned by the government of the prc, the original purpose of which was to attract foreign capital and technology to the prc for the modernisation of the prc&#146;s various industries. ses is a satellite services provider, owning and operating through subsidiaries, the astra satellite system covering europe, the americom satellite system covering north america and the new skies satellite system covering africa, south america and asia. ses has securities listed on the luxembourg stock exchange and euronext paris. following completion of the exchange transaction (as described below), the shares of bowenvale currently held by ses will be transferred to sih and its subsidiaries, and the shares of sih will then be transferred to the ge entities, affiliates of gecc, a wholly owned subsidiary of general electric capital services, inc., a corporation incorporated in the state of delaware, which itself is wholly owned by gec, a corporation incorporated in the state of new york. on completion of the exchange transaction, the ge entities will hold a 49.5 per cent economic interest and 50 per cent voting interest in bowenvale and, as a result, a 34.1 per cent indirect economic interest in asiasat. the remainder of bowenvale will continue to be owned indirectly by citic group. what are the proposals and the scheme? the share proposal is a proposal to privatise the company by way of the scheme to cancel all of the scheme shares (including without limitation the scheme shares underlying the adss), which will result in a reduction of the issued share capital of the company under section 46 of the companies act, and to issue the new asiasat shares to the offeror. the option proposal is an offer by the offeror to purchase for cancellation all outstanding options not exercised as of the scheme record time. the option proposal is subject to and conditional upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. the scheme is a scheme of arrangement under section 99 of the companies act. upon taking effect, the scheme will be binding on all asiasat shareholders, regardless of whether such asiasat shareholders attended or voted at the court meeting or the special general meeting. the purpose of the proposals and the scheme is for asiasat to become a private company, wholly owned indirectly by citic group and gecc through the offeror and bowenvale. 5 part ii &#150; questions and answers the scheme and the share proposal are not considered to be tender offers under us law. the option proposal, however, will be implemented by way of a tender offer which will be executed in reliance on, and compliance with, the exemptions afforded by rule 13e-3(g)(6) and rule 14d-1(c) or rule 13e-4(h)(8) under the exchange act. what are the classes and amounts of asiasat shares sought in the share proposal? the offeror is seeking to acquire all of the issued and to be issued asiasat shares (including those asiasat shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options in accordance with the rules of the share option scheme) other than asiasat shares already held by bowenvale, comprising asiasat shares listed on the stock exchange (and the asiasat shares underlying the adss listed on the nyse). what will i receive in exchange for my asiasat securities? the offeror is offering to pay: &#149; for each asiasat share, hk$18.30 in cash; and &#149; for each ads, hk$183.00 per ads in cash (ten times the share offer price since each ads represents ten asiasat shares). the amount paid in respect of asiasat shares underlying the adss will be converted by and paid directly by the ads depositary (less any fees and expenses of the ads depositary in connection with currency conversions under the ads deposit agreement and withholding taxes, if applicable) into us dollars at the exchange rate obtainable on the spot market on the date the cash consideration is received by the ads depositary for delivery in respect of your adss. you will not be required to pay any cancellation fee to the ads depositary for the cancellation of the adss. however, you will be required to pay the fees or expenses charged by your financial intermediary, if any. will the offeror increase the share offer price? as a result of the inclusion of a &#147;no increase&#148; statement in the announcement, under the takeovers code, the offeror may not increase the consideration offered in the proposals, other than in wholly exceptional circumstances namely in the event of a higher competing offer and the improved offer is recommended by the board. see &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors; 1.1 past contacts, transactions, negotiations and agreements.&#148; as a holder of outstanding options, what do i receive for my outstanding options if the scheme takes effect? as holder of outstanding options, you have two alternatives: (1) you can accept the offeror&#146;s offer to cancel your outstanding options at a price of hk$0.82 in cash for each outstanding b option and hk$3.95 in cash for each outstanding c option; or, (2) you are entitled to exercise in accordance with the rules of the share option scheme, your outstanding options, which confer rights to subscribe for asiasat shares at a price of hk$17.48 per asiasat share in respect of b options and hk$14.35 per asiasat share in respect of c options, in full or in part, in which case you will receive scheme shares and, accordingly you will be entitled to the share offer price if the share proposal becomes effective. scheme shares you receive may not be voted at the court meeting to the extent that any of those scheme shares are held by parties acting in concert with the offeror or to the extent you exercise your options after the voting record time. if you do not exercise your outstanding options under the share option scheme in accordance with the rules of the share option scheme, or accept the option proposal by the effective date, your outstanding options will lapse if the scheme becomes effective and binding. holders of outstanding options should also note that implementation of the option proposal is conditioned upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. how do the proposals compare with recent prices of asiasat shares? as of 8 february 2007, the pre-suspension date, the closing price of asiasat shares was hk$14.00 and of the adss was us$17.75. as of 9 february 2007, the suspension date, the closing price of asiasat shares was 6 part ii &#150; questions and answers hk$14.10. the average closing price of asiasat shares as quoted on the stock exchange over the 30 full trading days prior to the date of the announcement was hk$13.84. the share offer price represents: &#149; a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.00 per asiasat share as quoted on the stock exchange on the pre-suspension date; &#149; a premium of approximately 32.0 per cent over the closing price of us$17.75 per ads as quoted on the nyse on the pre-suspension date; &#149; a premium of approximately 29.8 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.10 per asiasat share as quoted on the stock exchange on the suspension date; &#149; a premium of approximately 32.2 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price of hk$13.84 per asiasat share; &#149; a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement ads price of us$17.93 per ads; &#149; a premium of approximately 4.3 per cent over the closing price of hk$17.54 per asiasat share as quoted on the stock exchange on the latest practicable date; &#149; a discount of approximately 0.5 per cent to the closing price of us$23.55 per ads as quoted on the nyse on the latest practicable date; &#149; a premium of approximately 1.4 per cent over the highest closing price of approximately hk$18.04 per asiasat share over the one year period prior to the latest practicable date; &#149; a discount of approximately 0.5 per cent to the highest closing price of approximately us$23.55 per ads over the one year period prior to the latest practicable date; &#149; an implied price to earnings multiple of 19.5 times, based on asiasat&#146;s reported basic earnings per share of hk$0.94 for the year ended 31 december 2005; &#149; an implied price to earnings multiple of 15.8 times, based on asiasat&#146;s reported basic earnings per share of hk$1.16 for the year ended 31 december 2006; &#149; a premium of approximately 74.0 per cent to the audited consolidated net asset value per asiasat share of approximately hk$10.52 as at 31 december 2005; &#149; a premium of approximately 61.5 per cent to the audited consolidated net asset value per asiasat share of approximately hk$11.33 as at 31 december 2006; and &#149; a premium of approximately 14.4 per cent over the possible mgo share offer price. what is the position of the independent board committee in regard to the proposals? the independent board committee, having considered the terms of the proposals and having taken into account the advice and recommendations of the independent financial adviser, considers that the terms of the share proposal and the option proposal are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders (including without limitation, the ads holders) and optionholders, respectively, are concerned. i am an asiasat shareholder, how do i vote on the proposals? if you are an asiasat shareholder, you may vote in person or by proxy at the court meeting (during which the scheme will be voted on, but only if you are also a scheme shareholder) and at the special general meeting (during which the scheme and its implementation will be voted on by all asiasat shareholders). whether or not you intend to attend either or both of the meetings, you should complete and sign the enclosed forms of proxy and return them in accordance with the instructions printed on them as soon as possible, but in any event so as to be received by computershare hong kong investor services limited at rooms 1806-1807, 18th floor, hopewell 7 part ii &#150; questions and answers centre, 183 queen&#146;s road east, wanchai, hong kong at least 48 hours before the time fixed for the relevant meeting or any adjournment of the relevant meeting. forms of proxy returned by facsimile will not be accepted. if the pink form of proxy for use at the court meeting is not lodged prior to the court meeting as set out above, it may be handed to the chairman of the court meeting at that meeting. in the case of the special general meeting, however, unless the white form of proxy is lodged at least 48 hours before the time fixed for the special general meeting, it will be invalid. completion and return of a form of proxy will not prevent you from attending and voting in person either at the court meeting or at the special general meeting, or any adjournment thereof, if you wish to do so. i am an ads holder, how do i vote on the proposals? since ads holders are not asiasat shareholders of record, they do not have the right to vote at the court meeting or the special general meeting. however, using the ads voting instruction card, ads holders may instruct the ads depositary to vote the asiasat shares underlying their adss. ads holders must return their completed ads voting instruction card to the ads depositary no later than 5:00 p.m. (new york time) on 17 april 2007. if you hold your adss through a financial intermediary, please follow the instructions they provide to you. ads holders may also become asiasat shareholders of record, and thereby have the right to vote at the court meeting and the special general meeting, by surrendering their adss for the purpose of withdrawal of the asiasat shares underlying such adss in accordance with the terms of the ads deposit agreement no later than 4:30 p.m. (new york time), on 13 april 2007. ads holders seeking to become asiasat shareholders of record will incur cancellation fees, taxes and other charges in connection with the exchange and withdrawal of their adss. what is the location, date and time of the meetings? the court meeting will be held at 17/f, the lee gardens, 33 hysan avenue, causeway bay, hong kong, on tuesday, 24 april 2007 at 10.00 a.m. local time. the special general meeting will be held at 17/f, the lee gardens, 33 hysan avenue, causeway bay, hong kong, on tuesday, 24 april 2007 at 10:30 a.m. local time (or as soon thereafter as the court meeting ends). are any of the conditions waivable? asiasat cannot waive any of the conditions. the offeror has reserved the right to waive the consent condition, either in whole or in part in respect of any particular matter. in the event that the authorisation condition and the further authorisation condition are not fulfilled by reason of an authorisation not having been obtained, the offeror reserves the right to assess the materiality of such non-fulfilment and to waive the fulfilment of such condition(s) to such extent it considers appropriate. the offeror may only invoke the mae condition as a basis for not proceeding with the share proposal if the provisions of note 2 to rule 30.1 of the takeovers code are satisfied. note 2 to rule 30.1 of the takeovers code provides that an offeror should not invoke any condition (other than the acceptance condition) so as to cause the offer to lapse unless the circumstances which give rise to the right to invoke the condition are of material significance to the offeror in the context of the offer. the waiver or invocation by the offeror of any condition in accordance with the terms of this paragraph shall not be subject to the company&#146;s agreement, approval or consent. what happens if the conditions are not met? all of the conditions set out below under &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 3. conditions of proposals&#148; will have to be fulfilled or waived, as applicable, on or before 30 june 2007 (or such later date as the offeror and the company may agree or (to the extent applicable) as the supreme court may direct and as may be permitted by the takeovers code), failing which the scheme will lapse. any extension to such later date shall not be beyond 31 october 2007. 8 part ii &#150; questions and answers what is the exchange transaction? the exchange transaction is a transaction pursuant to which gecc and ses have agreed that ses shall redeem gecc&#146;s entire indirect holding of ses shares (of approximately 19 per cent of the issued share capital of ses) in exchange for shares of a new company holding a number of assets and cash, including ses&#146;s entire shareholding in bowenvale. upon completion of the transfer, bowenvale will be jointly and indirectly owned by citic group (through able star) and the ge entities. the completion of the exchange transaction is one of the conditions to the share proposal, and is itself subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. see &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 9. the exchange transaction&#148;. do the scheme shareholders have the right to vote on the exchange transaction? no, the exchange transaction, including the transfer, is a bilateral, privately negotiated transaction among ses, gecc and the gecc parties. asiasat is not a party to any such transaction. what vote is required from the scheme shareholders in order for the scheme to be approved? the scheme must be approved by a majority in number of the scheme shareholders representing not less than three-fourths in value of the scheme shares, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the court meeting, provided that: (a) the scheme is approved by at least 75 per cent of the votes attaching to scheme shares held by scheme shareholders that are cast either in person or by proxy at the court meeting; and (b) the number of votes cast against the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting is not more than 10 per cent of the votes attaching to all scheme shares held by scheme shareholders. in the event that the scheme shareholders do not approve the scheme, it will not take effect. in addition to the vote for approving the scheme at the court meeting, approval of the special resolution for implementing the scheme will require the affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths of the votes cast by the asiasat shareholders present and voting (either in person or by proxy) at the special general meeting. if the scheme is approved at the court meeting, bowenvale has indicated that its asiasat shares (approximately 68.9 per cent of the total outstanding issued share capital) will be voted in favour of the special resolution to be proposed at the special general meeting for implementing the scheme. what will happen to the company if the scheme is approved? upon the scheme becoming effective, all scheme shares will be cancelled and share certificates for the scheme shares will cease to have effect as documents of evidence of title and should be returned to the company for cancellation. the company will become indirectly wholly owned by citic group and gecc through the offeror and bowenvale. as soon as practicable after the scheme becomes effective, asiasat will apply to the stock exchange for the withdrawal of the listing of the asiasat shares pursuant to rule 6.15 of the listing rules. scheme shareholders will be notified by way of a press announcement of the exact dates on which the scheme and the withdrawal of the listing of the asiasat shares on the stock exchange will become effective. citic group and gecc intend to seek to cause asiasat to terminate the ads deposit agreement and to have the listing of the adss on the nyse terminated. in addition, if the scheme becomes effective, the offeror intends to cause asiasat to file a form 15 with the sec to request that the company&#146;s reporting obligations under the exchange act be terminated or suspended, provided that the relevant rules and regulations of the sec are satisfied. it is the intention of citic group and gecc to maintain the existing businesses of the group upon successful privatisation of the company. citic group and gecc do not intend to introduce any major changes to the existing operating and management structure of the group, or to discontinue the employment of any employees of the asiasat group, as a result of the implementation of the proposals. upon the successful implementation of the proposals and asiasat becoming a private company, asiasat will, however, no longer have access to equity 9 part ii &#150; questions and answers funding through the public capital markets. citic group and gecc also expect that there will be no material change to the existing business (such as business focus and operating model) of the asiasat group as a result of the implementation of the proposals. citic group and gecc intend to retain the company&#146;s existing senior management team to manage the company after the implementation of the proposals. it is, however, intended that subject to obtaining the executive&#146;s consent under rule 7 of the takeovers code, upon completion of the exchange transaction, each of mr. romain bausch, ms. cynthia dickins and mr. mark rigolle, the ses appointees to the asiasat board, will resign as directors, and the ge entities will appoint four directors to the board for so long as the company remains public. rule 7 of the takeovers code provides that once a bona fide offer has been communicated to the board of the offeree company, except with the consent of the executive, the directors of an offeree company should not resign until the first closing date of the offer, or the date when the offer becomes or is declared unconditional, whichever is later. in the context of the proposals this means that none of the directors should resign before the date of the court meeting. in the context of the possible mgo share offer this means that none of the directors should resign before the first closing date of the possible mgo share offer. an application was made to the executive by ge equity and ses on 13 march 2007 to obtain consent in respect of rule 7, however, it is uncertain as to whether such consent will be granted. no determination has yet been made as to whether, and if so, how, the composition of the board may be changed upon completion of the proposals. it is intended that the possible mgo share offer document and possible mgo option offer letter (and related forms of acceptance) in respect of the possible mgo offers would not be posted until after the meetings are held. this is because if the scheme shareholders approve the scheme, the substance of the obligations that would arise under the possible mgo offers will have been satisfied and it would be redundant to despatch the formal documentation in respect of the possible mgo offers. what will happen to the company if the scheme shareholders do not approve the scheme? if the scheme shareholders do not approve the scheme and the transfer is completed, then the possible mgo offers will proceed. the possible mgo share offer document and possible mgo option offer letter (and related forms of acceptance) in respect of the possible mgo offers would be despatched to asiasat shareholders and the optionholders, respectively, following the failure or lapsing of the scheme. on 7 march 2007 the offeror and the company made a rule 8.2 application to the executive in relation to the time for despatch of the documentation in respect of the possible mgo offers, and the executive has agreed to extend this period to 2 may 2007. if the exchange transaction is not completed by this date the offeror and the company will make a further rule 8.2 application to the executive for a further extension to the time for despatch but there is no guarantee that the further extension will be granted. if the possible mgo share offer is made, it would be made at the possible mgo share offer price, payable in cash. the possible mgo share offer price is hk$16.00, compared to the share offer price of hk$18.30. if the possible mgo offers are required to be made, they would be made in compliance with the applicable requirements of the takeovers code and the exchange act, as well as in accordance with the terms of any relief from the sec obtained in connection with the proposals and the possible mgo offers. if the possible mgo option offer is made it would be made at the possible mgo option offer price, payable in cash. the offeror would offer to purchase options for cancellation in exchange for hk$0.01 for each b option and hk$1.65 for each c option. if the scheme does not become effective and binding and the transfer does not complete, the possible mgo offers will not be made. see &#147; what are the possible mgo offers? &#148; below. what will happen to the adss if the scheme takes effect? if the scheme takes effect, the ads depositary will upon exchange of your adss, receive cash in respect of the asiasat shares underlying the adss. each ads represents ten scheme shares and, accordingly, ads holders will be entitled to receive hk$183.00 per ads in cash, which will be converted into us dollars and paid directly by the ads depositary (less any fees and expenses of the ads depositary in connection with currency 10 part ii &#150; questions and answers conversions under the ads deposit agreement and withholding taxes, if any). such conversion would be at the exchange rate obtainable on the spot market on the date the cash consideration is received by the ads depositary for delivery in respect of the adss. in addition, completion of the scheme will ultimately result in the de-registration of the company under the exchange act, which would substantially reduce the information required to be publicly furnished by asiasat in the united states and would make certain provisions of the exchange act no longer applicable to asiasat (although, irrespective of the outcome of the scheme, it is expected that the maintenance of the ads listing on the nyse will be re-examined by asiasat and the board, the outcome of which may be to terminate such listing). for example, asiasat would no longer be required to file an annual report on form 20-f or to submit other materials under form 6-k. furthermore, asiasat would not be required to file any financial statements with the sec and would not be required to reconcile its financial statements to us gaap. in addition, if registration of the asiasat securities were terminated or suspended, the adss would no longer be eligible for listing on the nyse. furthermore, the ads deposit agreement may be terminated. can i choose the currency in which i receive payment for my asiasat shares, options or adss? no. asiasat shareholders and optionholders will receive payment in hong kong dollars, irrespective of their location. ads holders will receive payment in us dollars through the ads depositary or through their financial intermediary. does the offeror have the financial resources to make payment of the consideration for the asiasat shares and the adss? the proposals will be financed from the existing resources of citic group and gecc. the offeror&#146;s financial adviser, morgan stanley, is satisfied that sufficient financial resources are and will be available to the offeror for the implementation in full of the proposals. if my asiasat shares or adss are held in &#147;street name&#148; by my financial intermediary, will my financial intermediary vote my asiasat shares or adss for me? your financial intermediary (such as a broker) should send you directions on how to provide it with instructions to vote your asiasat shares. if you do not provide your financial intermediary with instructions on how to vote your &#147;street name&#148; asiasat shares (whether in the form of asiasat shares or adss), your financial intermediary will not be permitted to vote them on the share proposal. you should therefore be sure to provide your financial intermediary with instructions on how to vote your asiasat shares. if you do not give voting instructions to your financial intermediary, you will not be counted as voting for the purposes of the share proposal unless you have the asiasat shares (including any asiasat shares underlying your adss) registered in your name prior to the voting record time and appear in person at the relevant meeting or submit the forms of proxy in accordance with the instructions set out therein. as discussed above, ads holders do not have the right to vote at the court meeting or the special general meeting, but pursuant to the ads voting instruction card, ads holders may instruct the ads depositary to vote the asiasat shares underlying their adss at either meeting. can i change my vote after i have submitted my proxy with voting instructions? yes. if you hold asiasat shares there are three ways in which you may revoke your proxy and change your vote in respect of the scheme and the resolutions for implementing the scheme before the court meeting and the special general meeting, respectively: (a) you may notify the company in writing of the revocation of your proxy and lodge a new form of proxy, provided such revised form of proxy is lodged not less than forty-eight hours before the time for holding the court meeting or the special general meeting, or handed to the chairman of the court meeting, (as applicable); or (b) you may notify the company in writing of the revocation of your proxy, provided such revocation is lodged not less than two hours before the time for holding the court meeting or the special general 11 part ii &#150; questions and answers meeting (as applicable). as any revised form of proxy is required to be lodged not less than forty-eight hours before the time for holding the court meeting or the special general meeting, or handed to the chairman of the court meeting, (as the case may be), should you notify the company of the revocation of your proxy less than forty-eight hours before the time for the relevant meeting, you should attend and vote at the relevant meeting in person, or in the case of the court meeting ensure your revised form of proxy is handed to the chairman of the court meeting, should you still wish to vote your asiasat shares or scheme shares (as applicable) at such meeting; or (c) you may attend and vote at the court meeting or the special general meeting in person and in such event your proxy shall be deemed to be revoked. if you hold adss, you must contact the ads depositary in writing informing them of your revocation of your voting instruction and lodging of a new instruction, which must be received by the ads depositary no later than 5:00 p.m. (new york time) on 17 april 2007. if you have instructed a broker or other financial intermediary to vote your asiasat shares or adss, you must follow directions received from such broker or other financial intermediary to change or revoke your proxy. what are the possible mgo offers? the possible mgo offers are the possible mgo share offer and the possible mgo option offer, which are potential obligations on the part of able star and the ge entities to make a mandatory general offer for all asiasat shares and options not owned by bowenvale or parties acting in concert with it. the executive has taken the view that the acquisition by the ge entities of ses&#146;s entire shareholding in bowenvale pursuant to the exchange transaction would, on completion, result in the formation of a new concert group that has statutory control over bowenvale, which would trigger an obligation to make a mandatory general offer for asiasat under the takeovers code. whilst the view taken by able star and ge equity is different from that of the executive, the offeror has indicated it is prepared to make the possible mgo offers in the event the transfer completes but the scheme is unsuccessful. the possible mgo offers, if implemented, would be considered tender offers under the us federal securities laws and would comply with the relevant provisions of the exchange act, except to the extent exempted therefrom. what happens to the possible mgo offers if the scheme becomes effective? if the transfer is completed and all other conditions of the scheme are either satisfied or waived, the scheme will become effective and the substance of the obligations that would arise under the possible mgo offers will have been satisfied. in that case, no formal offer documentation will be despatched in respect of the possible mgo offers, and the possible mgo offers will not proceed. when do you expect the privatisation of asiasat to be completed? assuming that the scheme receives the approval of scheme shareholders at the court meeting and the resolutions for implementing the scheme receive the approval of asiasat shareholders at the special general meeting and all other conditions are fulfilled or waived in a timely manner, it is currently expected that the privatisation will complete by the end of may 2007. what are the us tax consequences of the privatisation of asiasat to scheme shareholders and ads holders? the receipt of cash for scheme shares under the privatisation will be a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under applicable state, local, foreign or other tax laws. generally, us holders of scheme shares will recognise a gain or loss for these purposes equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and their adjusted tax basis for the scheme shares that were owned immediately before completion of the scheme. for us federal income tax purposes, this gain or loss generally would be a capital gain or loss if the scheme shares are held as a capital asset. a us holder of options who receives cash in cancellation of such options pursuant to the option proposal will generally recognise, as ordinary income for us federal income tax purposes, the cash payment received. see &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors; 2.2 us federal income tax consequences&#148;. tax matters are very complex, and the tax consequences of the scheme to you 12 part ii &#150; questions and answers will depend on the facts of your own situation. it is recommended that you consult your tax adviser for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the scheme and the proposals to you. will i have to pay any fees or commissions? if you are the registered owner of your asiasat shares and/or adss and the scheme becomes effective, you will not have to pay brokerage fees or similar expenses. if you own your asiasat shares and/or adss through a broker or other nominee, you should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will apply. if the scheme becomes effective and you hold adss, you will not be required to pay any cancellation fee to the ads depositary for the cancellation of your adss. you will, however, be responsible for covering any fees charged by your financial intermediary or any charges related to your exchange of adss for asiasat shares for the purpose of voting at the meetings. in addition, the offeror will not pay interest on any amounts to be paid to asiasat shareholders pursuant to the scheme, the possible mgo offers or otherwise. how can i help to prevent &#147;empty voting&#148; to avoid market participants using borrowed stock to vote against the share proposal? if you are an asiasat shareholder, we strongly encourage you to exercise your right to vote or give instructions to the relevant registered owner to vote at the court meeting and at the special general meeting. if you keep or think you may have any asiasat shares in a share lending programme, we urge you to recall any outstanding asiasat shares on borrow to avoid market participants using borrowed stock to vote against the share proposal, which potentially could have a negative impact on the value of your asiasat shares. if you are acting as a registered owner, we should be grateful if you could inform any ultimate beneficial asiasat shareholders about the importance of exercising their vote. if you are an ads holder, you cannot vote at the court meeting or the special general meeting directly but you may instruct the ads depositary (as the registered asiasat shareholder) to exercise your right to vote in accordance with the ads voting instruction card enclosed. please complete and return the ads voting instruction card to the ads depositary in a timely manner. if you hold your adss through a financial intermediary, please follow the instructions that they provide to you. if you are in any doubt as to the action to be taken, you are encouraged to consult your licensed securities dealer, bank manager, solicitor, professional accountant or other professional adviser. whom should i call with additional questions? if ads holders or asiasat shareholders that are us residents have questions concerning administrative matters such as dates, documentation and procedures relating to the proposals, please call mellon investor services llc of 480 washington boulevard, jersey city, new jersey 07310, united states at +1 (866) 808-1336 or +1 (201) 680-5235. these helplines cannot and will not provide advice on the merits of the scheme, the possible mgo offers or the proposals or give any financial or legal advice. furthermore, mellon investor services llc will not be soliciting proxies or votes in respect of the scheme. 13 part iii &#150;

and (ii) the number of votes cast against the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting is not more than 10 per cent of the votes attaching to all scheme shares held by the scheme shareholders. based on 121,360,500 scheme shares held by the scheme shareholders as at the latest practicable date, 10 per cent of such scheme shares amounted to 12,136,050 scheme shares. the passing of a special resolution to approve, among other matters, the capital reduction of the relevant portion of the issued share capital of the company as a result of the scheme and the issue of new asiasat shares requires the affirmative vote by a majority of at least three-fourths of the votes cast by the asiasat shareholders present and voting, in person or by proxy, at the special general meeting. if the scheme is approved at the court meeting, bowenvale has indicated that its asiasat shares will be voted in favour of such special resolution. 15. exercising your right to vote if you are an asiasat shareholder, we strongly encourage you to exercise your right to vote or give instructions to the relevant registered owner to vote at the court meeting and at the special general meeting. if you keep or think you may keep any asiasat shares in a share lending programme, we urge you to recall any outstanding asiasat shares on borrow to avoid market participants using borrowed stock to vote against the share proposal, which potentially could have a negative impact on the value of your asiasat shares. if you are a registered owner, we should be grateful if you could inform any ultimate beneficial asiasat shareholders about the importance of exercising their vote. if you are an ads holder, please complete and return the ads voting instruction card to the ads depositary in a timely manner. if you hold your adss through a financial intermediary, please follow the instructions that the financial intermediary provides to you. if you are in any doubt as to the action to be taken, you are encouraged to consult your licensed securities dealer, bank manager, solicitor, professional accountant or other professional adviser. 16. action to be taken by optionholders the letter to optionholders setting out the terms and conditions of the option proposal is being despatched today separately to each of the optionholders. optionholders should refer to those letters, which are substantially in the form set out in &#147;appendix 1 &#150; sample letter to optionholders&#148; to this scheme document. optionholders should also note the instructions and terms printed on the option form of acceptance. the attention of optionholders is drawn to the rules of the share option scheme, and in particular paragraph 8.5 of the rules of the share option scheme. the option proposal is subject to and conditional upon the scheme becoming effective and binding but does not otherwise form part of the scheme. 17. recommendations in the letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee set out in &#147;part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee&#148; of this scheme document, the independent financial adviser states that it considers the terms of the proposals to be fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) are concerned and advises the independent board committee to recommend the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads 23 part iv &#150; letter from the board holders) to vote in favour of the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting and to vote in favour of the special resolution to approve, among other matters, the capital reduction arising as a result of the scheme and the issue of new asiasat shares at the special general meeting, and the terms of the option proposal are fair and reasonable so far as the optionholders are concerned. the independent board committee, having considered the terms of the proposals and having taken into account the opinion of the independent financial adviser, and in particular the factors, reasons and recommendations set out in its letter in &#147;part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee&#148; of this scheme document, considers that the terms of the proposals are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) are concerned and the terms of the option proposal are fair and reasonable so far as the optionholders are concerned. accordingly, the independent board committee recommends the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) to vote or procure to vote in favour of the resolution to approve, among other matters, the scheme at the court meeting and to vote or procure to vote in favour of the special resolution to approve, among other matters, the capital reduction arising as a result of the scheme at the special general meeting, and that optionholders accept the option proposal if they have not exercised their options in accordance with the rules of the share option scheme. the full text of the letter from the independent board committee is set out in &#147;part v &#150; letter from the independent board committee&#148; of this scheme document. further information you are urged to read carefully the letters from the independent board committee and from the independent financial adviser set out in &#147;part v &#150;

explanatory statement; 20. taxation&#148; and &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors; 2. tax consequences&#148;. asiasat shareholders, ads holders and optionholders should be aware that the implementation of the proposals and the implementation of the possible mgo offers (if any) are subject to the conditions being fulfilled or waived, as applicable, and thus the proposals may or may not become effective and the possible mgo offers may or may not be made. such persons are also advised to exercise caution when dealing in asiasat shares, adss and/or options. yours faithfully for and on behalf of the board mr. peter e. jackson chief executive officer 24 part v &#150;

contained in the part iv of the scheme document. terms used in this letter have the same meanings as defined in the scheme document. the independent financial adviser has been appointed to advise us in connection with the share proposal and the option proposal. having considered the terms of the share proposal and the option proposal, and having taken into account the advice and recommendations of the independent financial adviser contained in its letter in part vi of the scheme document (including the factors under the heading &#147;conclusion and opinion&#148; in its letter, which should be read in the context of the full text of that letter), we are of the opinion that the terms of the share proposal are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) are concerned, and that the terms of the option proposal are fair and reasonable so far as the optionholders are concerned. we therefore recommend the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) to vote in favour of both the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting and the special resolution to, among other matters, approve the capital reduction arising as a result of the scheme at the special general meeting. we also recommend the optionholders to accept the option proposal if they have not exercised their options in accordance with the rules of the share option scheme prior to the scheme record time. for further details, we recommend reading the discussion of &#147;fairness&#148;

letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee the following is the text of a letter of advice from clsa, the independent financial adviser appointed to advise the independent board committee, which has been prepared for the purpose of incorporation into this scheme document, setting out its advice to the independent board committee in connection with the share proposal and the option proposal. 19 march 2007 to the independent board committee of asia satellite telecommunications holdings limited dear sirs, proposed privatisation of asia satellite telecommunications holdings limited by asiaco acquisition ltd. by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 99 of the companies act of bermuda involving the cancellation of the scheme shares, issue of the new shares and withdrawal of listing and possible mandatory general offer introduction we refer to our engagement as the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee, the scheme shareholders and optionholders as to whether or not the terms and conditions of the proposal to privatise asiasat pursuant to the scheme and the proposal to cancel all outstanding options (together the &#147; proposals &#148;), and more particularly, the cancellation price of hk$18.30 per scheme share (the &#147; share offer price &#148;), hk$183.00 per ads, hk$0.82 per outstanding b option and hk$3.95 per outstanding c option (the &#147; option offer price &#148;), as defined and detailed herein below, are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders and optionholders, respectively, are concerned. this letter has been prepared for inclusion in the scheme document. capitalised terms used in this letter shall have the same meanings as defined in the scheme document unless the context otherwise requires. independent board committee pursuant to resolutions of the board dated 5 february 2007, the following independent non-executive directors of asiasat, being prof. edward chen, mr. robert sze and mr. james watkins, were appointed as members of the independent board committee for the purposes of advising the scheme shareholders and optionholders in respect of the share proposal and the option proposal respectively. in the event that the possible mgo share offer and the possible mgo option offer are subsequently made, the independent board committee would also advise scheme shareholders and optionholders in respect of such offers. as all of the non-executive directors of the company (other than the members of the independent board committee) were nominated by either citic group or ses, the independent board committee therefore does not include the non-executive directors. basis of our opinion in connection with the preparation and delivery of our opinion to the independent board committee and the board, we performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, as described below. the preparation of a fairness and reasonableness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis, and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. furthermore, in arriving at our opinion, we did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by us, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each 26 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee analysis and factor. accordingly, we believe that our analyses must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying our opinion. in formulating our opinion with regard to the proposals, we have relied on the information, opinions and facts supplied, and representations made, to us by the directors and representatives of asiasat (including those contained or referred to in the scheme document and the announcement issued by the offeror and asiasat dated 13 february 2007 (the &#147; announcement &#148;)). we have assumed that all such information, opinions, facts and representations which have been provided to us by the directors, and representatives of asiasat, and for which they are wholly responsible, are true and accurate in all material respects. we have also relied on certain information available to the public and we have assumed such information to be accurate and reliable, and we have not independently verified the accuracy of such information. further, we have relied on the representations of the directors that they have made all reasonable inquiries, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no other facts, the omission of which would make any statement contained in the scheme document or the announcement untrue or misleading. we have also assumed that statements and representations made or referred to in the scheme document and the announcement were accurate at the time they were made and continue to be accurate at the date of despatch of the scheme document. we consider that we have reviewed sufficient information to enable us to reach an informed view regarding the proposals to justify our recommendation, relying on the accuracy of the information provided in the scheme document and the announcement as well as to provide a reasonable basis for our advice. as the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee, we have not been involved in the negotiations in respect of the terms and conditions of the proposals. our opinion with regard to the terms and conditions thereof has been made on the assumption that all obligations to be performed by asiasat and the offeror in relation to the proposals will be fully performed in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. further, we have no reason to suspect that any material facts or information have been omitted or withheld from the information supplied or opinions expressed to us nor to doubt the truth, accuracy and completeness of the information, facts and representations provided, or the reasonableness of the opinions expressed, to us by asiasat, its directors and its representatives. in line with normal practice, we have not, however, made any independent verification of the information and facts provided, representations made or opinions expressed by asiasat, its directors and its representatives, nor have we conducted any form of independent investigation into the business affairs or assets and liabilities of asiasat. accordingly, we do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any such information. our opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the information publicly available to us as of, the date of this opinion. as a result, circumstances could develop prior to completion of the proposals that, if known to us at the time we rendered our opinion, would have altered our opinion. our opinion is also subject to the following qualifications: (i) it is not possible to confirm whether or not the share proposal and the option proposal, are in the interests of each individual scheme shareholder or optionholder, respectively, and each scheme shareholder and optionholder should consider his/her/its vote on the merits or otherwise of the share proposal and the option proposal respectively, in his/her/its own circumstances and from his/her/its own point of view having regard to all the circumstances (and not only the financial perspective offered in this letter) as well as his/her/its own investment objectives; (ii) we express no opinion as to whether the proposals will be completed nor whether they will be successful; (iii) nothing contained in this letter should be construed as us expressing any view as to the trading price or market trends of any securities of asiasat at any particular time; and (iv) nothing contained in this letter should be construed as a recommendation to hold, sell or buy any securities in asiasat. 27 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee this letter is for the information of the independent board committee solely in connection with their consideration of the proposals and, except for its inclusion in the scheme document and for references thereto in the letter from the independent board committee set out in the scheme document, is not to be quoted or referred to, in whole or in part, nor shall this letter be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. our opinion is directed to the independent board committee, addresses only the fairness and reasonableness of the consideration to be received by scheme shareholders and optionholders in the proposals and does not address the relative merits of the proposals or any other transaction that may have been available as an alternative to the proposals, whether or not any such alternative could be or could have been achieved, or the terms upon which any such alternative transaction could be or could have been achieved. further, our opinion addresses only issues related to the fairness and reasonableness to scheme shareholders and optionholders of the proposals. clsa is a licensed securities adviser and corporate finance adviser under the sfo and we, together with our affiliates, provide a full range of investment banking and brokerage services, which, in the course of normal trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and hold securities, including derivative securities, of asiasat, its subsidiaries or its substantial shareholder (as defined in the listing rules) or those of the offeror, able star, citic group, ge equity and gecc for the accounts of customers. clsa will receive a fee from asiasat for rendering this opinion. asiasat has also agreed to indemnify clsa and certain related persons against liabilities and expenses in connection with this engagement. in connection with the preparation of our opinion, we made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as we have deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. among other things, we: &#149; reviewed asiasat&#146;s audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended 2000 through 2006, the annual reports on form 20-f for the fiscal years ended 2000 through 2005 and asiasat&#146;s unaudited financial statements for the two months ended 28 february 2007, which asiasat&#146;s management has identified as being the most current financial statements available; &#149; met with certain members of asiasat&#146;s management and auditors to discuss the operations, financial condition, future prospects and projected operations and performance of asiasat; &#149; reviewed the historical market prices and trading volume for the asiasat shares and the adss; &#149; reviewed certain other publicly available financial data for certain companies that we deemed comparable to asiasat; &#149; reviewed various documents relating to asiasat; &#149; reviewed the company&#146;s current financial projections and its past financial projections against actual performance; and &#149; conducted such other studies, analyses and inquiries as we deemed appropriate. in assessing the fairness and reasonableness of the consideration to scheme shareholders and optionholders under the proposals, we independently valued asiasat using widely accepted valuation methodologies. background to and material terms of the proposals detailed terms of the proposals are as set out in &#147;part iv &#150; letter from the board&#148; and &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in the scheme document and the scheme shareholders and optionholders are strongly urged to read the entire &#147;part iv &#150; letter from the board&#148; and &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in the scheme document. on 13 february 2007, the offeror requested the board to put forward the share proposal to the scheme shareholders for cancellation of the scheme shares to effect the privatisation of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 99 of the companies act and informed the board that it will make the option proposal (detailed below) to optionholders for the cancellation of outstanding options in exchange for cash. if approved, the scheme will be binding on all scheme shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the court meeting or the special general meeting. the effect of the proposals is that asiasat will become wholly owned by citic group and gecc, through bowenvale as to 68.9 per cent and through the offeror as to 31.1 per cent. the asiasat shares held by bowenvale will not form part of the scheme shares. 28 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee gecc and ses have agreed to pursue the exchange transaction, which involves the redemption by ses of gecc&#146;s entire shareholding (of approximately 19 per cent) in ses in exchange for stock of a newly incorporated company that will own a number of assets. among these assets is ses&#146;s entire 49.5 per cent shareholding in bowenvale which ses will transfer to such newly incorporated company. bowenvale holds approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued ordinary shares of the company. accordingly, upon completion of the exchange transaction, able star and ge equity will jointly own, through bowenvale, 68.9 per cent of the asiasat shares. in consideration of citic group agreeing to terminate, with respect to ses, the shareholders&#146; agreement, and releasing the ses parties from their obligations under and liabilities pursuant to the shareholders&#146; agreement, citic group will receive a cash payment of hk$100 million from ses or any of its subsidiaries. such cash payment will be made directly by ses (or the relevant subsidiary) to citic group upon completion of the exchange transaction. the executive has taken the view that the transfer would, on completion, result in the formation of a new concert group that has statutory control of bowenvale, thereby triggering a mandatory general offer obligation in respect of asiasat. accordingly, the possible mgo offers were announced simultaneously with the announcement of the proposals. as explained in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in the scheme document, the possible mgo offers will only be made in the event that the transfer completes but the scheme is unsuccessful, and the formal offer documentation in respect of the possible mgo offers will not be despatched, if at all, until after the meetings have been held. as scheme shareholders are not required to make a decision in relation to the possible mgo offers at this stage, we have considered the possible mgo offers in this letter solely for the purpose of comparing the possible mgo offers against the proposals. in the event that the possible mgo offers are made, we will provide a separate opinion letter to the independent board committee for inclusion in the formal offer documentation in respect of the possible mgo offers. 1. the proposals 1.1. the share offer price and option offer price as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in the scheme document, the proposals are made on the following basis: the share proposal hk$18.30 in cash for each scheme share hk$183.00 in cash for every ads the option proposal hk$0.82 in cash for each outstanding b option hk$3.95 in cash for each outstanding c option 1.2. the share proposal as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in the scheme document, the aim of the share proposal is to privatise the company by way of the scheme and to cancel all the scheme shares (including scheme shares underlying the adss), which will result in a reduction of the issued share capital of the company under section 46 of the companies act and to issue the new asiasat shares to the offeror. in consideration for the cancellation of the scheme shares, scheme shareholders will be entitled to receive the share offer price, being hk$18.30 per scheme share, in cash. no asiasat share acquired by the offeror pursuant to the share proposal will be transferred, charged or pledged to any other person, and there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings in place to do the same, nor are there any related charges or pledges which may result in the transfer of voting rights attached to asiasat shares. 29 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee the effect of the proposals is that asiasat will become wholly owned by citic group and gecc, through bowenvale as to 68.9 per cent and through the offeror as to 31.1 per cent. after the scheme becomes effective, the offeror may transfer its entire interest in asiasat to bowenvale. a dividend declared by the company after 13 february 2007 (being the date of the announcement) and prior to the scheme becoming effective will be declared on the following basis: (i) the amount of the dividend shall not affect the share offer price if the scheme becomes effective and binding on and before 10 may 2007; (ii) the amount of the dividend will be deducted from the share offer price if the scheme becomes effective and binding after 10 may 2007; (iii) if the scheme becomes effective and binding prior to 10 may 2007, the dividend shall not be paid; and (iv) if the scheme does not become effective, the dividend will be paid to asiasat shareholders on the register of members of the company at 4:30 p.m. on 10 may 2007. further terms of the share proposal, including the procedures for acceptances, are set out in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in the scheme document. 1.3. implications for ads holders as the adss are governed by the ads deposit agreement and not bermuda law, implementation of the scheme will not result in and of itself in cancellation of the adss. instead, upon the scheme becoming effective, the scheme shares underlying adss will be cancelled along with all other scheme shares, and the cash received by the ads depositary (as registered owner of the scheme shares underlying the adss) upon cancellation of such scheme shares will be converted into us dollars by the ads depositary and distributed (less any fees and expenses of the ads depositary in connection with currency conversions under the ads deposit agreement and withholding tax, if applicable) to the ads holders pro rata to their holdings upon surrender of their adss, in accordance with the provisions of the ads deposit agreement. 1.4. the option proposal in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme, optionholders are entitled to exercise their options, which confer rights to subscribe for asiasat shares at a price of hk$17.48 per asiasat share in respect of b options and hk$14.35 per asiasat share in respect of c options, in full or in part at any time from the date of such notice until the earlier of (i) two calendar months after the date of the notice of the court meeting and (ii) the date on which the scheme is sanctioned by the supreme court, but the exercise of the options as described above shall be conditional upon the scheme becoming effective. optionholders should note that under the rules of the share option scheme: (i) optionholders have the right to exercise options up to two calendar months after the date of despatch of the scheme document or the date of the sanction of the scheme by the supreme court, whichever is the earlier; (ii) optionholders who exercise their options prior to the voting record time will become scheme shareholders who may vote on the scheme, provided they are not concert parties of the offeror; and (iii) optionholders who exercise their options after the voting record time may do so until the scheme record time, but will only be able to do so subject to the terms of the scheme and conditional upon the scheme being sanctioned by the supreme court, and will therefore be bound by the scheme. asiasat shares issued upon exercise of the options in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme prior to the scheme record time will form part of the scheme shares. options which are not exercised in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme and in relation to which the option proposal is not accepted will lapse, subject to and conditional upon the scheme becoming effective. the option proposal is conditional upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. 30 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee if optionholders do not exercise their options, the option proposal offers optionholders the opportunity, in respect of each outstanding option, to receive a payment of hk$0.82 for each b option and hk$3.95 for each c option, in cash. as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in this scheme document, the option offer price represents a see-through price of hk$0.82 per outstanding b option and hk$3.95 per outstanding c option, that is, the share offer price less the relevant exercise price for the options. this means that the optionholders are being offered the same price they would have received if they had exercised the options, became holders of scheme shares, and received the share offer price upon cancellation of such scheme shares. further information on the option proposal is set out in the scheme document and the option proposal will be made by or on behalf of the offeror in a letter to optionholders to be despatched on the same day as the scheme document. 1.5. total consideration on the basis of the share offer price of hk$18.30 per scheme share and 390,265,500 asiasat shares in issue, of which 121,360,500 were scheme shares as at the latest practicable date (including scheme shares underlying the adss), the scheme shares are valued at approximately hk$2,221 million. save for the options, there are no outstanding options, warrants, derivatives or other securities issued by asiasat that carried a right to subscribe for or which are convertible into asiasat shares. assuming none of the options are exercised prior to the scheme record time in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme and on the basis of the option offer price of hk$0.82 per outstanding b option, and hk$3.95 per outstanding c option, the option proposal is valued at approximately hk$14 million. assuming all options are exercised in full by the optionholders in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme prior to the scheme record time, no consideration will be payable under the option proposal, and the number of scheme shares will accordingly increase to 126,193,000 and the scheme shares would be valued at approximately hk$2,309 million. the total amount of cash required to effect the proposals is approximately hk$2,235 million if none of the options are exercised prior to the scheme record time. this amount would increase to an aggregate of approximately hk$2,309 million if all options are exercised prior to the scheme record time. 1.6. conditions of the proposals the share proposal will become effective and binding on the company and all scheme shareholders subject to fulfilment or waiver (as applicable) of the following conditions: (a) the approval by way of poll of the scheme by a majority in number of the scheme shareholders representing not less than three-fourths of the nominal value of the scheme shares, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the court meeting, provided that: (i) the scheme is approved by at least 75 per cent of the votes attaching to scheme shares held by scheme shareholders that are cast either in person or by proxy at the court meeting; and (ii) the number of votes cast against the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting is not more than 10 per cent of the votes attaching to all scheme shares held by scheme shareholders;

(c) the sanction of the scheme (with or without modifications) by the supreme court and the delivery to the registrar of companies in bermuda of a copy of the order of the supreme court for registration; (d) the compliance with the procedural requirements of section 46 of the companies act in relation to the reduction of the issued share capital of the company; 31 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee (e) all other authorisations in connection with the share proposal having been obtained from the relevant authorities in bermuda, hong kong, the united states and other relevant jurisdictions (if any); (f) all authorisations remaining in full force and effect without variation, and all necessary statutory or regulatory obligations in all relevant jurisdictions having been complied with and no requirement having been imposed by any relevant authorities which is not expressly provided for in these conditions, or is in addition to the requirements expressly so provided for, in relevant laws, rules, regulations or codes in connection with the proposals or any matters, documents (including circulars) or things relating thereto, which is material in the context of the group as a whole in each aforesaid case up to and at the time when the scheme becomes effective; (g) all necessary third party consents required under contractual obligations of asiasat which are material in the context of the group as a whole having been obtained; (h) a waiver from the hong kong broadcasting authority in respect of compliance with statements and representations regarding the legal and beneficial interests in the licensees&#146; voting control and shares set out in the licensees&#146; non-domestic television programme service licences issued by the hong kong broadcasting authority; (i) confirmation from ofta (in a form satisfactory to the executive for the purposes of compliance with note 4 to rule 26.2 of the takeovers code) that the proposals will not have, or be likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition in a telecommunications market in hong kong as referred to in section 7p of the telecommunications ordinance;

explanatory statement&#148; in this scheme document, the offeror reserves the right to waive condition (g) either in whole or in part in respect of any particular matter. in the event that conditions (e) or (f) are not fulfilled by reason of an authorisation not having been obtained, the offeror reserves the right to assess the materiality of such non-fulfillment and to waive the fulfillment of such condition(s) to such extent where it considers appropriate. conditions (a) to (d), and conditions (j) and (l) cannot be waived in any event. the offeror may only invoke condition (m) as a basis for not proceeding with the scheme if the provisions of note 2 to rule 30.1 of the takeovers code are satisfied. note 2 to rule 30.1 of the takeovers code provides that an offeror should not invoke any condition (other than the acceptance condition) so as to cause the offer to lapse unless the circumstances which give rise to the right to invoke the condition are of material significance to the offeror in the context of the offer. the waiver or invoking by the offeror of any condition in accordance with the terms of this paragraph shall not be subject to the company&#146;s agreement, approval or consent. the offeror may not waive any other condition in any event, and the company has no right to waive any of the conditions. all of the above conditions will have to be fulfilled or waived, as applicable, on or before 30 june 2007 (or such later date as the offeror and the company may agree or (to the extent applicable) as the supreme court may direct and as may be permitted by the takeovers code), failing which the scheme will lapse. any extension to such later date shall not be beyond 31 october 2007. the implementation of the option proposal is conditional upon the share proposal becoming effective and binding. 32 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee as stated in the &#147;part iv &#150; letter from the board&#148; in this scheme document, asiasat shareholders, ads holders and optionholders should be aware that the implementation of the proposals and the implementation of the possible mgo offers (if any) are subject to the conditions being fulfilled or waived, as applicable, and thus the proposals may or may not become effective and the possible mgo offers may or may not be made. such persons are also advised to exercise caution when dealing in asiasat shares, adss and/or options. 2. the possible mgo offers as stated in &#147;part iv &#150; letter from the board&#148; in this scheme document, the possible mgo offers are potential obligations on the part of able star and ge equity to make a mandatory general offer for asiasat shares not owned by bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it. in the event that the transfer completes but the scheme fails or lapses, the possible mgo share offer document, possible mgo option offer letter and forms of acceptance in respect of the possible mgo offers would be despatched to asiasat shareholders and optionholders respectively, following the failure or lapsing of the scheme. if the possible mgo share offer is made, it will be made at the possible mgo share offer price, payable in cash. the possible mgo share offer price is hk$16.00 compared to the share offer price of hk$18.30. the possible mgo share offer, if and when made, will not be subject to any condition. if scheme shareholders vote in favour of the scheme, the supreme court sanctions the scheme and the order of the supreme court sanctioning the scheme is filed with the registrar of companies in bermuda, the scheme will be binding on all scheme shareholders, including those that would not have voted in favour of the scheme. in this event, there will not be a choice for the offeror to pay the mgo share offer price and the share offer price, which is higher than the mgo share offer price, will have to be paid. in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme, optionholders are entitled to exercise their options, which confer rights to subscribe for asiasat shares at a price of hk$17.48 per share in respect of b options and hk$14.35 per share in respect of c options, in full or in part at any time within 21 days of despatch of the formal mgo documentation (or such later date as the directors may determine). asiasat shares issued upon exercise of the options in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme will form part of the possible mgo shares. if the possible mgo option offer is not accepted within the relevant time period and in relation to which the options are not exercised in accordance with the rules of the share option scheme, such options will lapse. under the possible mgo option offer, the offeror will offer to purchase options, for cancellation in exchange for hk$0.01 in cash for each b option and hk$1.65 in cash for each outstanding c option. further information on the possible mgo options offer will be set out in the formal offer document to be issued in respect of the possible mgo share offer (if and when made) and the possible mgo option offer will be made by or on behalf of the offeror in a letter to optionholders to be despatched on the same day as such formal offer document. as stated in &#147;part ix &#150; the possible mgo offers&#148; in this scheme document, if the possible mgo share offer is made and sufficient acceptances of the possible mgo share offer are received, it is the intention of the offeror to make use of the compulsory acquisition provisions of the companies act. in the event the compulsory acquisition thresholds are attained, subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the takeovers code and the listing rules, the listing of asiasat shares will be withdrawn from the stock exchange and the offeror intends to cause the company to apply for de-listing of the adss from the nyse. please see &#147;part ix &#150; the possible mgo offers&#148; in this scheme document for further details regarding the possible mgo offers. clsa has also been appointed to advise the independent board committee in relation to the possible mgo offers and, in the event that they are made, the related offer document would include letters of advice from the independent board committee and clsa in respect of the possible mgo offers. however, as the share offer 33 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee price and the option offer price are significantly higher than the possible mgo share offer price and possible mgo option offer price, and at this stage, scheme shareholders are only being asked to consider the share proposal, we do not express an opinion on the possible mgo offers themselves for the purposes of this letter. principal factors considered in considering whether or not the terms and conditions of the proposals are fair and reasonable and in the interests of the scheme shareholders and optionholders as a whole, we have taken into consideration, amongst others, the following factors: 1. reasons for the proposals as described in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in the scheme document, due to the persistent oversupply of transponder capacity and the slow introduction of new applications in the region, the asia-pacific satellite market remains very competitive. such competition is cited as the reason for the underperformance of the company&#146;s share price which, in the three year period prior to the announcement date, decreased by 11.9 per cent compared to an increase of 51.1 per cent in the hang seng index over the same period. based on our discussions with asiasat&#146;s management, we do not expect a dramatic improvement in the competitive environment in which the company operates in the near term. given the overcapacity in the market, able star and ge equity believe that the unsatisfactory share performance of asiasat&#146;s shares may continue. in the view of the offeror, asiasat&#146;s dividend yield remains relatively low as the company needs to preserve cash to endure competition in the market for commercial supply of satellite transponder capacity, to launch new satellites from time to time and to participate in potential acquisitions. as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in this scheme document, the amount of dividends per asiasat share paid in the past two years were: payment date dividends paid per asiasat share hk$ 14 november 2006 (interim dividend) 0.08 23 may 2006 (final dividend) 0.27 15 november 2005 (interim dividend) 0.08 18 may 2005 (final dividend) 0.27 able star and ge equity therefore believe that the earnings of asiasat will continue to be under pressure in the short to medium term. as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in this scheme document, the offeror currently has no plans to increase the company&#146;s annual or interim dividend, cause the company to distribute any extraordinary dividend, or recapitalise the company&#146;s balance sheet by increasing the company&#146;s financial leverage in the ordinary course of business in the event the transfer completes and/or the scheme becomes effective. as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in this scheme document, able star and ge equity propose to effect a privatisation through the scheme to enable asiasat to pursue development of its business with greater flexibility, and to effect the privatisation at a price in excess of the possible mgo share offer price in order to give minority shareholders a premium price for their asiasat shares. a further reason advanced for the proposals is that the privatisation would also, if it completes, relieve asiasat of the heavy financial and administrative burden of dual listings on both the stock exchange and the nyse. in particular, as stated in the explanatory statement, the listing on the nyse has, in recent years, resulted in substantial recurrent professional fees and time costs, which, in the view of able star and ge equity are disproportionate to the benefits of maintaining such listing. the final reason advanced in the scheme document for the proposals is that, as a private company, asiasat management should have greater flexibility to focus on the development of business and marketing activities, which is cited as being particularly important given that asiasat is operating in a competitive market in which 34 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee profitability is under pressure as a result of persistent oversupply of transponder capacity and the substantial investment required to construct and launch new satellites. 2. intentions of the offeror regarding asiasat as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in this scheme document, it is the intention of the citic group and gecc to maintain the existing businesses of the asiasat group upon the successful privatisation of the company. citic group and gecc do not intend to introduce any major changes to the existing operating and management structure of the asiasat group, or to discontinue the employment of any employees of the asiasat group, as a result of the implementation of the proposals. upon the successful implementation of the proposals and asiasat becoming a private company, asiasat will no longer have access to equity funding through the public capital markets. citic group and gecc also expect that there will be no material change to the existing business (such as business focus and operating mode) of the asiasat group as a result of the implementation of the proposals. we note that subject to the privatisation of the company, citic group and gecc contemplate that they will assess whether to revise asiasat&#146;s bye-laws to reflect its change from a public to a private company. we also note that citic group and gecc intend to retain the company&#146;s existing senior management team to manage the company after the implementation of the proposals. 35 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee 3. precedent privatisation premiums we have identified from publicly available sources 1 all successful privatisation transactions, to the best of our knowledge, by way of scheme of arrangements on the main board of the stock exchange announced since 1 january 2003 up to and including 13 february 2007, being the date of the announcement (the &#147; precedent privatisations &#148;), and have reviewed the premiums represented by the acquisition price over the net asset value (&#147; nav &#148;) per share and the average daily closing price of various periods of the precedent privatisations. the following is a summary of the precedent privatisations: share premium (%) company date of announcement cancellation price last full trading day 2 last 5-day trading price last 10-day trading price last 30-day trading price nav per share 3 nav premium (hk$) (hk$) (%) st honore holdings ltd 17 november 2006 2.95 43.9 % 45.6 % 51.9 % 57.5 % 1.02 188.8 % winsor industrial corporation ltd. 4 september 2006 5.50 48.6 % 50.9 % 59.4 % 69.0 % 5.43 1.3 % egana jewellery and pearls ltd 10 july 2006 1.80 13.9 % 14.2 % 15.9 % 23.2 % 1.57 14.6 % snp leefung holdings ltd 28 june 2006 1.68 60.0 % 62.5 % 66.8 % 66.9 % 1.49 12.8 % china national aviation company ltd 8 june 2006 2.80 42.1 % 45.8 % 52.2 % 51.8 % 0.99 181.6 % china resources cement holdings ltd 31 march 2006 2.45 35.4 % 43.6 % 49.8 % 70.0 % 3.32 -26.3 % asia aluminum holdings ltd 16 march 2006 1.45 26.1 % 31.3 % 36.3 % 49.7 % 0.92 58.0 % new world tmt ltd 2 november 2005 0.75 78.6 % 79.9 % 76.1 % 70.1 % 0.75 0.3 % henderson china holdings ltd 19 may 2005 8.00 66.7 % 61.6 % 61.1 % 64.3 % 13.97 -42.7 % hgc holdings ltd 3 may 2005 0.65 36.8 % 45.1 % 44.0 % 43.8 % 0.03 n/m kwong sang hong international ltd 4 november 2004 1.25 5.0 % 13.8 % 23.0 % 36.2 % 1.34 -6.5 % alpha general holdings 13 october 2004 0.70 125.8 % 134.9 % 134.1 % 134.2 % 1.33 -47.4 % chevalier construction holdings ltd 31 october 2003 0.25 16.3 % 16.3 % 16.5 % 23.9 % 0.31 -18.5 % pacific concord holding ltd 26 may 2003 0.65 51.2 % 55.1 % 61.3 % 60.8 % 2.19 -70.3 % oxford properties &amp;

nav premiums &#148;) of 0.3 per cent, and is on the high end of the nav premiums range of -70.3 per cent to 188.8 per cent. on the other hand, the premiums represented by the share offer price over the average daily closing price of the asiasat shares at various periods are below the average and median premiums over the average daily closing price of the precedent privatisations (&#147; share premiums &#148;) at various periods, but is within the range of the share premiums. 4. precedent transactions in the satellite industry we have identified from publicly available sources 1 all completed transactions since 2004 which involved the acquisition of more than a 30 per cent interest in companies that mainly provide satellite services, with a transaction value of over us$100 million (approximately hk$780 million) (the &#147; precedent transactions&#148; ), and have reviewed the key multiples of the precedent transactions. the following is a summary of the precedent transactions: target name acquirer name date of announcement % interest acquired transaction value (us$millions) implied ev/ebitda (times) 3 implied p/e (times) 3 new skies satellites holdings ltd. ses global s.a. 14 december 2005 100.0 % 1,132.03 7.22 n/m 4 panamsat holding corporation intelsat, ltd 29 august 2005 100.0 % 6,271.11 21.90 n/m 4 intelsat, ltd. zeus holdings limited 16 august 2004 100.0 % 5,000.00 6.78 16.60 new skies satellites n.v. blackstone group 6 june 2004 note 2 955.95 7.76 80.37 panamsat corp kohlberg kravis roberts &amp;

letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee as shown in the table above, the enterprise value over earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (&#147; ev/ebitda &#148;) represented by the share offer price of 6.38 times is lower than those of the precedent transactions; while the price earnings multiple (&#147; p/e &#148;) represented by the share offer price of 15.78 times is lower than those of the precedent transactions. however, as all of the precedent transactions involved european and us targets that enjoy more favourable operating conditions than satellite operators in the asia-pacific region, in which we have not been able to identify recent precedent transactions, we consider the precedent transactions to be of limited relevance to the proposals for comparison purposes. we also note that, unlike the share proposal, the majority of the precedent transactions involved the acquisition of a majority interest in the target. 5. share offer price compared to comparable companies we have identified from publicly available sources 1 all listed companies mainly engaged in the provision of satellite services with a market capitalisation of more than us$100 million in europe, the united states and asia-pacific (the &#147; comparable companies &#148;) and have reviewed the key multiples of the comparable companies. the following is a summary of the comparable companies: market capitalisation 2 p/e 3 2006 2007 (us$ million) (times) (times) european companies ses global 5,914.5 16.38 17.37 inmarsat plc 3,730.1 n/m 42.76 eutelsat communications 4,343.1 25.67 18.28 average 21.02 26.14 us companies globalstar inc 755.8 23.35 55.08 rrsat global comm. 176.7 n/a n/a geoeye inc 313.0 n/a n/a average 23.35 55.08 asia-pacific companies shin satellite public comp. 246.1 n/m 14.39 measat global berhad 298.0 17.34 n/a jsat corp 873.4 49.02 19.18 average 33.18 16.79 asiasat 914.0 15.78 15.50 n/a: not available notes: 1. source: bloomberg. 2. calculated based on the closing share price on the pre-suspension date, as well as the following exchange rates: 1 euro = 1.30 usd 1 gbp = 1.95 usd 1 usd = 33.70 thb 1 usd = 3.49 myr 1 usd = 121.94 jpy 1 usd = 7.81 hk$ 3. for comparable companies, calculated based on the closing share price on the pre-suspension date and bloomberg estimates. for asiasat, calculated based on the share offer price and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2006 and bloomberg estimates for the year 2007. 38 1 source: bloomberg part vi &#150;

review period &#148;) were as follows: average daily closing price highest closing price lowest closing price average daily trading volume (hk$) (hk$) (hk$) (shares) 2005 1st quarter 14.66 15.00 14.20 129,781 2nd quarter 14.12 15.10 13.50 201,008 3rd quarter 14.61 15.95 13.60 121,474 4th quarter 13.51 14.90 12.95 162,160 2006 1st quarter 13.39 14.85 12.20 210,969 2nd quarter 13.27 14.00 13.00 288,513 3rd quarter 13.04 13.30 12.28 146,134 4th quarter 13.88 15.00 12.90 116,297 2007 1 january - pre-suspension date 13.84 14.00 13.54 193,250 source: bloomberg the share offer price represents a premium of: &#149; approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of asiasat shares of hk$14.00 as quoted on the stock exchange on the pre-suspension date; &#149; approximately 32.5 per cent over the average daily closing price of asiasat shares of hk$13.81 during the review period; 39 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee &#149; approximately 14.7 per cent over the highest daily closing price of asiasat shares of hk$15.95 during the review period; and &#149; approximately 14.4 per cent over the possible mgo share offer price of hk$16.00. during the review period, asiasat shares traded within the range of hk$12.20 to hk$15.95 (the highest price being achieved in august 2005), and the closing price as at the pre-suspension date was hk$14.00. following the date of the announcement, the price of asiasat shares has significantly increased, and as at the latest practicable date, the closing price of asiasat shares was hk$17.54. on the other hand, the average daily trading volume of asiasat shares during the review period was about 175,000 asiasat shares, but has significantly increased to about 251,000 asiasat shares between the date of the announcement to the latest practicable date. scheme shareholders should note that there is no assurance that the trading price of asiasat shares will remain at current levels if the scheme does not proceed to completion. scheme shareholders should also note that the past trading performance of asiasat shares should not in any way be relied upon as an indication of its future trading performance. if the scheme is not successful, the trading price of asiasat shares may revert to their historical trading range before the date of the announcement, which may be below the share offer price. as such, the proposals offer the scheme shareholders and the optionholders an opportunity to exit and monetise their investment in asiasat shares and options at the share offer price and the option offer price, respectively. 7. discounted cash flow (&#147;dcf&#148;) analysis we have also analysed the share offer price using the dcf methodology. we performed the dcf analysis based on projections provided by management of asiasat, as adjusted based on our discussions with asiasat management regarding asiasat&#146;s operating environment, business expansion plans and other factors, but have not independently verified the information used. we then applied different discount rates and terminal growth rates to derive an indicative valuation range for asiasat shares. the share offer price falls within our dcf analysis result range. the dcf analysis should not be regarded as an indication of what price asiasat shares should or could be achieved or indications of profit forecast. 8. other considerations as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in this scheme document, the offeror has no current intention to introduce any major change to the existing operating and management structures of asiasat. as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; in this scheme document, the offeror will not increase any of the offer prices. each of the share offer price, the option offer price, the possible mgo share offer price and the possible mgo option offer price represents the best and final offer price in respect of the share proposal, the option proposal, the possible mgo share offer and the possible mgo option offer, respectively. asiasat shareholders should be aware that, following the making of these statements in the announcement, the offeror is not allowed to increase any of the offer prices, save in wholly exceptional circumstances, as provided in rule 18.3 of the takeovers code. notwithstanding the above, the offeror has stated that it reserves the right not to be bound by these statements in the event of a competing offer and such competing offer is recommended by the board. as at the latest practicable date, bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it hold an aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued share capital of asiasat. if any third party were to make a competing offer for the privatisation of asiasat, such competing offer would not succeed without the acceptance by bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it. bowenvale has stated that it has no intention to accept any competing offer. asiasat shareholders should be aware that, in the event asiasat shares held by the public represent less than 25 per cent of the issued asiasat shares, trading in asiasat shares on the stock exchange may be suspended. it should be noted that if the possible mgo offers are made and close, there may be insufficient public float in asiasat shares and therefore, trading in asiasat shares may be suspended until the prescribed level of public float is attained. asiasat shareholders should also note that the share offer price represents a premium of approximately 14.4 per cent to the possible mgo share offer price. if the possible mgo share offer is made and sufficient acceptances 40 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee of the possible mgo share offer are received, it is the intention of the offeror to make use of the compulsory acquisition provisions of the companies act. in the event the compulsory acquisition thresholds are attained, subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the takeovers code and the listing rules, the listing of asiasat shares will be withdrawn from the stock exchange and the offeror intends to cause the company to apply for de-listing of the adss from the nyse. rule 2.11 of the takeovers code states that, except with the consent of the executive, where any person seeks to acquire or privatise a company by means of an offer and the use of compulsory acquisition rights, such rights may only be exercised if, in addition to satisfying any requirements imposed by law, acceptances of the offer and purchases, in each case of the disinterested shares, made by the offeror and persons acting in concert with it during the period of four months after the posting of the initial offer document total 90 per cent of the disinterested shares. conclusion and opinion in reaching our opinion (on the bases set out at the beginning of this letter), we have considered the above principal factors and reasons and, in particular, have taken into account the following in arriving at our opinion: &#150; the reasons for the proposals, in particular the competitive environment for satellite service providers in the asia-pacific region due to the persistent oversupply of transponder capacity and the slow introduction of new applications in the region; &#150; the historical trading performance of asiasat shares and persistent low levels of liquidity in asiasat shares; &#150; the share offer price represents a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.00 of asiasat shares as quoted on the stock exchange on the pre-suspension date, a premium of approximately 32.5 per cent over the average daily closing price of asiasat shares of hk$13.81 during the review period, a premium of approximately 14.7 per cent over the highest daily closing price of asiasat shares of hk$15.95 during the review period, and a premium of approximately 14.4 per cent over the possible mgo share offer price of hk$16.00; &#150; the share offer price represents a premium over the nav per share (after adjusting for dividends), which is substantially higher than the median premium over nav per share offered in the precedent privatisations, and is on the high end of the premiums over nav per share per share range of the precedent privatisations; &#150; the premium represented by the share offer price over the price of asiasat shares as of the pre-suspension date and average daily closing prices of asiasat shares over various periods falls within the range of relevant premiums of the precedent privatisations; &#150; while the ev/ebitda and p/e represented by the share offer price are lower than those of the precedent transactions, all of the precedent transactions involved european and us targets that enjoy more favourable operating conditions than satellite operators in the asia-pacific region; &#150; the p/e represented by the share offer price is lower than those of the comparable companies; &#150; the share offer price is within the dcf analysis result range based on the projections provided to us by the management of asiasat; &#150; the option offer price represents cash equal to the cash payment which optionholders would receive if they had exercised their outstanding options and accepted the share proposal in respect of those shares arising as a result of such exercise; &#150; as bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it hold an aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued share capital of asiasat, if any third party were to make a competing offer for the privatisation of asiasat, such competing offer would not succeed without the acceptance by bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it, and bowenvale has stated that it and parties acting in concert with it have no intention to accept any competing offer; &#150; the offeror will not be allowed to increase any of the offer prices, save in wholly exceptional circumstances, as provided in rule 18.3 of the takeovers code; and 41 part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee &#150; the proposals offer the scheme shareholders and the optionholders an opportunity to exit and monetise their investment in asiasat shares and options at the share offer price and the option offer price, respectively. having considered the above, we are of the opinion that the terms and conditions of the proposals, in particular the share offer price and the option offer price, are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders and the optionholders, respectively, are concerned. accordingly, we advise the independent board committee to recommend to the scheme shareholders to approve the scheme at the court meeting and to vote in favour of the special resolution to approve and give effect to the scheme at the special general meeting to be convened on tuesday, 24 april 2007 and recommend to the optionholders to accept the option proposal for any options outstanding as at the day of the hearing of the petition for the sanction of the scheme by the supreme court. yours faithfully, for and on behalf of clsa equity capital markets limited robert reid managing director 42 part vii &#150; us special factors 1. special factors 1.1 past contacts, transactions, negotiations and agreements 1.1.1 past contacts, transactions and negotiations except as described below and as set forth in this scheme document, there have not been any negotiations, transactions or material contacts during the past two years concerning any merger, consolidation, acquisition, tender offer or other acquisition of any class of asiasat&#146;s securities, election of asiasat&#146;s directors or sale or other transfer of a material amount of asiasat&#146;s assets between (i) asiasat or any of its affiliates within the meaning of us federal securities laws, on the one hand, and (ii) the offeror or any of its affiliates within the meaning of us federal securities laws, on the other hand. asiasat has entered into transactions from time to time with its current and former shareholders, their affiliates and other connected persons. it is asiasat&#146;s policy that such transactions be effected on terms which asiasat believes to be comparable to those available with unaffiliated parties. for so long as asiasat is listed on the stock exchange, all transactions between asiasat and its directors or any of their respective associates (as defined in the listing rules) constitute connected transactions of asiasat under the listing rules and unless exemptions are applicable or waivers are granted, are subject to independent shareholders&#146; approval in a general meeting. asiasat has from time to time conducted transactions, including those specifically described below, with its shareholders, their affiliates and other connected persons: (i) in 2005 and 2006, the company made payments to ses and a subsidiary of citic group amounting to approximately hk$0.5 million and approximately hk$0.5 million respectively in each year, for certain non-executive directors representing ses and citic group; and (ii) in a 1996 agreement among the company, citic group, and other parties, citic group acquired demand and piggyback registration rights, according to which citic group may require the company (a) to register, under the us securities act of 1933, its asiasat shares for public offering, and (b) to pay all expenses in connection with such registration. in the shareholders&#146; agreement, citic group acquired the right to require bowenvale, on citic group&#146;s behalf, to cause the company to file such registration. also in the shareholders&#146; agreement, ses acquired the right to cause bowenvale to cooperate with the company to procure for ses registration rights on similar terms to those held by citic group. upon the completion of the exchange transaction, the shareholders&#146; agreement will be terminated. citic group and the ge entities will execute a new shareholders&#146; agreement in respect of bowenvale, to become effective upon the completion of the exchange transaction, and which will be substantially similar to the shareholders&#146; agreement (so long as asiasat remains a public company). as a result, the ge entities will have rights similar to those granted to ses under the shareholders&#146; agreement and described above. the exercise by citic group or ses (or, following the exchange transaction, the ge entities) of registration rights could adversely affect the market price of the asiasat shares and the adss and could impair asiasat&#146;s future ability to raise capital through an offering of its equity securities. the exchange transaction gecc indirectly acquired a significant equity investment in ses in 2001 as partial consideration for the transfer of gecc&#146;s satellite business to ses. over time gecc disposed of a portion of its indirect equity investment in ses. in october 2006, gecc and ses began discussions in relation to the exchange transaction. on 17 october 2006, ses suggested several assets that might be included in the exchange transaction, one of which was its shareholding in asiasat (through bowenvale). since 25 october 2006, representatives of gecc and ses met from time to time to discuss the outline of the exchange transaction. those discussions resulted in a 30 november 2006 non-binding outline of proposed terms that representatives of the parties agreed to use as the basis for consulting their boards of directors and negotiating a definitive agreement. the outline included the following assets owned by ses that would be exchanged for ses shares held indirectly by gecc: &#149; the amc-23 satellite and its related business; &#149; 100 per cent of satlynx, a managed satellite services business based in europe; 43 part vii &#150; us special factors &#149; 49.5 per cent economic interest and 50 per cent voting interest in bowenvale (representing a 34.1 per cent economic interest in asiasat); &#149; 19.99 per cent of star one, a satellite operator based in brazil; and &#149; 5.5 per cent of orbcomm, a satellite services business based in the united states. while the parties considered the values of each component of the proposed exchange transaction, they negotiated the transaction as a whole and did not negotiate separate prices for individual components. in its consideration of the exchange transaction, gecc was assisted by representatives of morgan stanley &amp; co. incorporated (&#147; morgan stanley &amp; co. &#148;) and its affiliates based in new york and europe. gecc also engaged near earth llc (a provider of financial advisory services to companies and investors in the satellite, media and telecom industries) and morgan stanley &amp; co. to provide valuations of the businesses and assets to be acquired in the exchange transaction. gecc also appointed weil gotshal &amp; manges llp (&#147; weil gotshal &#148;) as its legal adviser on us law in respect of the exchange transaction. on 7 december 2006, the ses board of directors reviewed the proposed exchange transaction, authorised ses management to continue negotiating it, and appointed a special committee of the board to review terms of the transaction as it evolved through negotiation. on 8 december 2006, ses approached able star to seek its consent to the transfer pursuant to the shareholders&#146; agreement. on 12 december 2006, representatives of gecc met with representatives of citic group to discuss the transfer. citic group had been provided limited advice on an ad hoc basis with regard to asiasat by representatives of morgan stanley based in hong kong, and gecc agreed not to object to the continued representation of citic group by morgan stanley and citic group agreed not to object to the continued representation of gecc by morgan stanley &amp; co. as described above. while ses had expected that gecc could indirectly acquire the bowenvale shares without triggering a mandatory general offer under the takeovers code for all other asiasat shares not held by bowenvale or parties acting in concert with it, citic group expressed concern about the possible effects of the transfer under the takeovers code, including any impact on citic group&#146;s ability to participate in a voluntary offer for asiasat shares, if desired. citic group also inquired about gecc&#146;s intentions as a prospective bowenvale shareholder. citic group mentioned the possibility of the privatisation of asiasat, and the possibility of a joint privatisation of asiasat with ge equity (the &#147; privatisation &#148;), and enquired whether ge equity would be supportive of the privatisation. in subsequent discussions, able star imposed conditions for its consent and its release of the ses parties from most of their obligations and liabilities under the shareholders&#146; agreement. these conditions include a cash payment of hk$100 million by ses and/or its subsidiaries on completion of the exchange transaction and ses&#146;s continuation of certain of its obligations under the shareholders&#146; agreement, in modified form, under a new agreement. representatives of gecc and ses commenced negotiation of definitive documentation to effect the proposed exchange transaction in early december 2006. at a meeting held on 21 december 2006, a specially constituted committee of the board of directors of ses authorised ses management to continue negotiating the exchange transaction. negotiation of definitive agreements continued between ses and gecc, at the same time as discussions were proceeding with citic group and other parties whose consent was required for the exchange transaction. on 8 january 2007, ses and gecc representatives met with the executive to discuss the proposed exchange transaction. on 12 february 2007, ses and gecc completed negotiations and signed definitive agreements for the exchange transaction in escrow, with release of such documents and effectiveness of such signing to occur upon public release of the announcement. the privatisation of asiasat since june 2003, management of asiasat and the board have considered from time to time de-listing from nyse and de-registering from the sec due to the high cost involved of maintaining the nyse listing and sec registration. in august 2005, in light of the increasing costs of consultants and external accountants to carry out the work required under the us sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related sec rules, the two major shareholders of the company (through bowenvale), citic group and ses, started to consider alternatives to deal with this issue, including the de-listing and privatisation of asiasat. at the 17 november 2005 board meeting of asiasat, 44 part vii &#150; us special factors de-listing and de-registration of asiasat in the united states were discussed, but since the estimated number of us asiasat shareholders was greater than 300 and possible reforms of the sec de-registration rules were still in flux, de-listing and more importantly de-registration in the united states were considered impracticable. privatisation seemed to be a viable option to reduce the heavy financial and administrative burden of the listing of adss on the nyse and to provide greater flexibility on developing business and marketing activities. in 2006, following ses&#146;s acquisition of new skies satellites, numerous discussions were held between citic group and ses to resolve the issues of conflict between new skies satellites and asiasat but without success. several parties each contacted citic group in 2006 to ascertain if citic group would be receptive to a transaction involving ses&#146;s bowenvale stake, but in each case citic group determined that it was not interested in pursuing discussions at that time. in the second quarter of 2006, able star began to consider the options and alternatives available for its investment in asiasat. for this purpose, able star approached several financial institutions, including morgan stanley, for financial advice and linklaters for legal advice. most of the proposals received from the financial institutions were for able star to privatise the company. it was also concluded that any change in the present bowenvale structure, such as replacing ses with a third party, might trigger a mandatory general offer under the takeovers code. during january 2007 and february 2007, as described above, further discussions were held between ses and gecc with a view to concluding an agreement regarding an exchange transaction, and between able star and ge equity regarding the privatisation. discussions were also held with the sfc, ofta and the sec to obtain relevant approvals, consents and guidance in respect of, among other things, the hk$100 million cash payment, the sfc&#146;s views on the obligation to make a mandatory general offer, the exchange transaction, the possible mgo share offer price and the change of control regulations under the telecommunications ordinance of hong kong. on 10 january 2007, representatives of morgan stanley presented to representatives of citic group and gecc in beijing on the proposed timetable, privatisation tactics, asiasat historical price performance and financial analysis to evaluate the potential offer price range. as part of the privatisation plans, it was decided that a bid vehicle would be used to make an offer for asiasat. accordingly, able star and ge equity formed the offeror and acquired one share each in the total issued share capital of two shares of the offeror on 17 january 2007. the offeror appointed linklaters as its legal advisers on hong kong law, english law and us law on 5 january 2007 and morgan stanley as its financial adviser and appleby hunter bailhache as its legal advisers on both bermudan and british virgin islands law on 9 february 2007. ge equity had previously appointed morgan stanley &amp; co. as its financial adviser in relation to the exchange transaction and weil gotshal as its legal adviser on us law in respect of the exchange transaction. in january 2007, as part of the discussions relating to the privatisation, ge equity appointed freshfields bruckhaus deringer as its legal advisers on hong kong law in respect of the privatisation. on 5 february 2007, the board held a meeting with and at which mr. mi zeng xin, a designee of citic group on the board, explained that citic group and a possible joint offeror (a ge entity) were contemplating the possibility of making a proposal to the company to privatise the company by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 99 of the companies act. the proposal would involve a cancellation scheme whereby existing shares of the company not already held by citic group and persons acting in concert with it would be cancelled in exchange for cash. mr. mi zeng xin also explained that separately, the possible joint offerors would propose a cash offer to purchase for cancellation options issued pursuant to a share option scheme established by the company, subject to and conditional upon the scheme of arrangement becoming effective and binding. mr. romain bausch, a designee of ses on the board, explained, as well, that ses intended to dispose of its interest in the company&#146;s controlling shareholder, bowenvale, and that the executive had advised ses that the transfer of such interest to a third party would, on completion, result in the formation of a new concert group that has statutory control over bowenvale, which would trigger an obligation to make a mandatory general offer for all asiasat shares not already owned by bowenvale or parties acting in concert with it. it was noted that no purchase price for any of the foregoing had yet been set. in light of the proposals put forward at the meeting, the board resolved to create the independent board committee. professor edward kwan yiu chen, mr. robert tsai to sze and mr. james watkins, as the 45 part vii &#150; us special factors independent non-executive directors of the board, were appointed to the independent board committee. the board then discussed the need to engage legal counsel to advise it of its duties and responsibilities under the takeovers code and other relevant laws and regulations, and its obligation to retain an independent financial adviser to advise the independent board committee in connection with the proposals. on 6 february 2007 and 7 february 2007, representatives from the company (including mr. peter e. jackson, the chief executive officer, mr. william wade, the deputy chief executive officer, ms. sue yeung, the chief financial officer, and ms. catherine chang, legal counsel), and external bermudan counsel conyers dill &amp; pearman (&#147; conyers &#148;) (on 7 february 2007 only), external hong kong counsel johnson stokes &amp; master (&#147; jsm &#148;) and external us counsel paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton &amp; garrison llp (&#147; paul weiss &#148;) participated in conference calls to discuss the company&#146;s response to the proposals. the parties discussed the implications of the proposals under the various legal and regulatory regimes that would be applicable, including the procedural and substantive requirements of a &#147;going private&#148; transaction in the form of a scheme of arrangement under applicable hong kong, united states and bermuda laws and regulations. external hong kong and us counsel to the offeror, linklaters, had provided representatives of the company with a draft of a joint announcement that would set forth the details of the proposals. over the course of the next few days, conyers, jsm and paul weiss exchanged comments on drafts of the joint announcement with linklaters. on 8 february 2007, the independent board committee, representatives from the company (including mr. peter e. jackson, ms. sue yeung and ms. catherine chang), jsm, conyers and paul weiss participated in conference calls to discuss the process by which the company and the independent board committee would respond to the proposals. the independent board committee was advised as to the implications of the proposals under the various legal and regulatory regimes that would be applicable, including the procedural and substantive requirements of a &#147;going private&#148; transaction in the form of a scheme of arrangement. the parties also discussed negotiation of coverage by the offeror of a portion of the company&#146;s out-of-pocket expenses in the event that following announcement, the scheme did not become effective and binding. also on 8 february 2007, a draft of the announcement was submitted to the sfc for its comments and approval, and further discussions were held among conyers, jsm and paul weiss and between such counsel and linklaters. on 9 february 2007, due to the fluctuations in the trading price of the company&#146;s shares, the company requested trading in asiasat shares on the stock exchange to be suspended and trading was suspended from 11:19 a.m. on 9 february 2007 (hong kong time). later in the day, paul weiss contacted the nyse to inform it of the suspension in trading of the asiasat shares on the stock exchange, and the nyse determined that trading in the company&#146;s adss would also be suspended. on 12 february 2007, the offeror held a board meeting during which two alternative offer prices were discussed, namely hk$18.00 without a &#147;no increase&#148; statement or hk$18.25 with a &#147;no increase&#148; statement. under the takeovers code, if the offer price is accompanied by a &#147;no increase&#148; statement, the offeror will not be able to raise the offer price save in wholly exceptional circumstances (unless the right to do so had been specifically reserved). although the offeror believed hk$18.00 to be a fair and reasonable offer price, which was based on a number of considerations including the historical performance of the asiasat shares, the premiums paid in relevant previous privatisation transactions in respect of companies listed on the stock exchange, the implied multiples paid in precedent acquisitions of satellite companies despite the control premium element of those transactions and the valuation multiples implied by the trading share prices of other public regional satellite companies although they are not direct comparables, representatives of the offeror decided to approach asiasat with the hk$18.25 offer price with the qualification that it would be accompanied when announced with a &#147;no increase&#148; statement. the rationale was to give public shareholders an extra hk$0.25 premium as well as to put forward its the best offer price at the outset. the offeror had not considered any price above hk$18.25, which it saw as the highest price it would be willing to pay. later on 12 february 2007, representatives from the offeror, along with morgan stanley, conducted a telephone discussion with the management of asiasat regarding the offeror&#146;s proposal. the offeror proposed a fixed best and final offer price of hk$18.25, which represented approximately a 30 per cent premium over the latest closing price of asiasat shares as well as over the 30-day average closing price of asiasat shares. during the 46 part vii &#150; us special factors telephone discussion, the asiasat representatives expressed concerns that &#147;no increase&#148; statement may limit the ability of the independent board committee to negotiate with the representatives of the offeror. the asiasat representatives also explained that any proposed price must be considered further by the independent board committee and by the independent financial adviser, which had not yet been appointed, before the independent board committee could agree to recommend the share proposal to scheme shareholders. the parties ended the teleconference with an agreement that no announcement would be made until the price issues could be resolved. following the call, asiasat management and mr. sze discussed asiasat&#146;s alternatives with paul weiss. also on 12 february 2007, a revised draft of the announcement was submitted to the sfc and the stock exchange. further drafts of the announcement were commented upon by counsel. the sfc and the stock exchange issued comments to the announcement on the same day, which were considered and incorporated by counsel. on 13 february 2007, mr. peter e. jackson discussed with mr. mi zeng xin (representing the offeror) regarding the fixed offer price of hk$18.25 put forth the previous day. mr. peter e. jackson counter-offered for hk$18.50. mr. mi zeng xin did not accept the counter-offer and explained that hk$18.25 already represented the best offer price that the offeror would consider. thereafter, another conversation was conducted between mr. peter e. jackson and morgan stanley. representatives of morgan stanley re-iterated on behalf of the offeror that hk$18.25 was the offeror&#146;s best and final offer, and that if the independent board committee wanted an offer price without a &#147;no increase&#148; statement, the offer price would have to be lower in order to leave negotiating room for the offeror. the offeror would be likely to start with a price lower than hk$18.00 and there was no guarantee that the final offer price could be negotiated up to the best offer price of hk$18.25. during the conversation, mr. peter e. jackson, negotiating on behalf of the board, counter-offered for hk$18.35 with a &#147;no increase&#148; statement in order for the board to consider putting forward the share proposal to the scheme shareholders. representatives of morgan stanley suggested that they would attempt to convince the offeror to add hk$0.05 on top of the best and final price of hk$18.25 in good faith, if the board would agree to put forward a joint announcement with the hk$18.30 proposal. morgan stanley representatives stressed that although an additional hk$0.05 might not seem to be a large amount, it was material and significant from the offeror&#146;s perspective as it increased what the offeror believed to be the highest price it would consider. mr. peter e. jackson discussed with mr. william wade, who agreed with the proposal and the issuance of the joint announcement. mr. peter e. jackson also conveyed the proposal to mr. robert tsai to sze and mr. james watkins, on behalf of the independent board committee. messrs. sze and watkins advised mr. peter e. jackson to communicate to morgan stanley that ultimately they could not fully assess a fair price without more time and the involvement of an independent financial adviser (which would have to await the latter&#146;s appointment), but that if in keeping with market practice in hong kong an announcement would have to contain a price, the offeror should make its formal proposal to asiasat with the understanding that the independent board committee process would have to run its course following the issuance of the announcement and that, if the price had a &#147;no increase statement&#148;, the independent board committee would be left with the options of determining that the terms of the proposals are fair or declining to do so. after negotiations that resulted in an increase in offer price from the earlier hk$18.25 &#147;best and final offer price&#148; to hk$18.30, mr. peter e. jackson called morgan stanley to convey that the board would be willing to support a joint announcement with the improved hk$18.30 share offer price and the &#147;no increase&#148; statement. based on this, the offeror agreed to the hk$18.30 proposal. later on 13 february 2007, the offeror requested the board to put forth the share proposal to the scheme shareholders, at an offer price of hk$18.30 per asiasat share. representatives of the offeror also informed the board that the offeror would, in conjunction with the share proposal, make the option proposal to optionholders for the cancellation of options in exchange for cash. the same day, the announcement was re-submitted to the sfc and the stock exchange with updated terms and responses to the comments of the sfc and the stock exchange of 12 february 2007. the sfc and the stock exchange subsequently indicated their approval and clearance of the announcement. later on 13 february 2007, the board met to review and to put forward the announcement as a joint announcement, along with the offeror and ratified the application for suspension of trading of the asiasat shares and authorised preparation of a scheme document in respect of the scheme. on 13 february 2007, in consideration for able star and citic group agreeing to enter into a consent letter (as outlined further below), ses entered into an agreement of restrictive covenants with citic group, ses global 47 part vii &#150; us special factors holding ag, bowenvale and the offeror pursuant to which ses agreed on behalf of the ses group to certain restrictive covenants relating to asiasat customers, certain limited business opportunities and employees of asiasat up until 30 june 2008. on 13 february 2007, gecc, citic group, able star, ses, ses global holding ag and bowenvale entered into a consent letter (the &#147; consent letter &#148;) pursuant to which, among other things, (i) citic group consented to the transfer of the bowenvale shares by ses to a newly incorporated company subject to the acquisition by ge (as defined in the consent letter) of the beneficial and legal ownership of the entire share capital of such newly formed company, (ii) certain parties agreed certain outline terms of a new shareholders&#146; agreement in respect of bowenvale to be entered upon completion of the exchange transaction, (iii) citic group and ge agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the consent letter, to a potential joint privatisation of asiasat to be implemented by way of a general offer or a scheme of arrangement of asiasat, to be announced at or around the same time as the exchange transaction was announced, (iv) for citic group&#146;s and able star&#146;s consent and release of its obligations and liabilities under the shareholders&#146; agreement, ses or any of its subsidiaries including ses global holding ag would pay hk$100 million in cash to citic group upon the closing of the exchange transaction, and (v) the parties to the shareholders&#146; agreement agreed that the shareholders&#146; agreement (other than clause 19 (confidentiality)) would be terminated in its entirety and cease to have effect as from completion of the exchange transaction and ses would be released from certain liabilities under the shareholders&#146; agreement. the new shareholders&#146; agreement to be entered into in respect of bowenvale on completion of the exchange transaction has not yet been agreed, but will be based upon the current shareholders&#146; agreement with certain changes. upon the successful privatisation of asiasat, able star and the ge entities may consider entering into a simpler shareholders&#146; agreement in respect of bowenvale to reflect asiasat&#146;s status as a private company, as opposed to a publicly listed company. on 13 february 2007, citic group, able star, gecc and ge equity entered into a cooperation agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed, among other things, on (i) how the conduct of the privatisation would be regulated, including but not limited to using reasonable endeavours to take all steps necessary or desirable in connection with the implementation of and obtaining all necessary clearances for the privatisation and agreeing to discuss significant matters in respect of the privatisation in good faith, (ii) using reasonable endeavours to amalgamate the asiasat shares held by the offeror and bowenvale after the successful privatisation in a manner to be discussed in good faith, (iii) the sharing of expenses in respect of the privatisation, and (iv) the basis upon which a new shareholders&#146; agreement in respect of bowenvale will be entered into. on 13 february 2007, the offeror and asiasat entered into an agreement pursuant to which the offeror agreed to reimburse asiasat for any direct expenses up to a maximum aggregate amount of us$3 million which are incurred by asiasat in connection with (i) the proposed privatisation of asiasat by the offeror by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 99 of the companies act and/or, (ii) the possible unconditional mandatory general offer for asiasat by the offeror. such costs would only be reimbursed in the circumstance where (i) the scheme or the possible mgo share offer is not announced pursuant to the takeovers code on or prior to 31 march 2007, or (ii) after announcement, the scheme does not become unconditional for any reason (unless it is not recommended by the independent board committee or not recommended as fair and reasonable by the independent financial adviser appointed by such committee). this reimbursement obligation is in addition to the offeror&#146;s obligation under rule 2.3 of the takeovers code to cover asiasat&#146;s expenses if either the independent board committee or clsa does not recommend the proposals and the scheme is not approved. on 13 february 2007 ge equity, able star, citic group, general electric company and the offeror entered into a shareholders&#146; agreement regulating the parties&#146; respective rights and obligations (whether direct or indirect) in respect of the offeror and , upon completion of the scheme, the asiasat shares acquired by the offeror as a result of the privatisation. the main provisions of this shareholders&#146; agreement reflect those of the current shareholders&#146; agreement and will become effective only upon the offeror acquiring all of the outstanding asiasat shares not already owned by bowenvale (&#147; completion &#148;) and include, among other things, (i) an agreement to transfer the offerer&#146;s interest in asiasat to bowenvale as soon as reasonably practicable after completion, (ii) the reorganisation of the capital structure of the offeror, (iii) provisions governing the composition of the board of the offeror, (iv) provisions governing the representation of the offeror directors on the board (of asiasat), (v) rules governing the operation of board and shareholder meetings, (vi) the exercise of voting rights in the offeror, and (vii) restrictions on disposals of shares in the offeror for a period of three years (subject to certain exceptions). 48 part vii &#150; us special factors on 14 february 2007 (hong kong time), the announcement by the company and the offeror regarding the proposals was published. in addition, an application was made by the company to the stock exchange for resumption of trading in asiasat shares with effect from 9:30 a.m. on 14 february 2007 (hong kong time). trading in asiasat shares resumed on the stock exchange. trading also resumed in the adss with effect from commencement of the nyse trading day on 14 february 2007. commencing 14 february 2007, citic group, gecc, the offeror and asiasat, as well as their respective legal and financial advisers, held a series of meetings and telephone conversations in connection with the preparation of this document and other documentation to be sent to asiasat shareholders, optionholders and ads holders. on 16 february 2007, the independent financial adviser met with mr. peter e. jackson, mr. william wade, ms. sue yeung and ms. catherine chang from the company, and jsm, to discuss the regulatory requirements under the takeovers code. on 21 february 2007, the independent board committee appointed clsa as independent financial adviser to advise the independent board committee in relation to the proposals and the possible mgo offers. on 23 february 2007, a representative of clsa, ms. catherine chang and mr. william wade spoke with paul weiss concerning clsa&#146;s role and proposed approach. on 27 february 2007, the board received a copy of a letter dated 26 february 2007 addressed to the offeror from an investment fund (the &#147; fund &#148;) purporting to hold in excess of 10 per cent of the scheme shares, which stated that the fund believed that the share offer price is inadequate. the fund indicated its intention to vote against the scheme, which would prevent the scheme conditions from being satisfied. however, it should be noted that the fund is not obligated to inform the offeror or the board of any changes in its holdings or voting intention. on 27 february 2007, the independent board committee met with clsa, with paul weiss in attendance via conference call, to discuss the procedures to be followed by clsa in preparing its letter to the independent board committee and the process to be followed by the independent board committee in reaching the determination that would be reflected in its letter to the scheme shareholders and the optionholders. following discussion of a draft of clsa&#146;s letter, the independent board committee members requested that clsa address additional analyses in their letter. the members also discussed the receipt of the 26 february 2007 shareholder letter. on 28 february 2007, asiasat sent a letter to the fund requesting disclosure of its interests in the company pursuant to section 329 of the sfo. in response to such request, the company received a letter from the fund on 7 march 2007 confirming the number of shares that it held (which as at 6 march 2007 would be in excess of 10 per cent of the scheme shares). the fund further stated that, while it maintained its intention to vote against the proposals, it would continue to evaluate its position regarding the share proposal and invited the company to direct the fund&#146;s attention to any relevant information which the company believed would impact on the fund&#146;s preliminary decision. on 3 march 2007, the independent board committee met with clsa, at which meeting paul weiss, jsm and conyers were also present by telephone, and at which clsa made a presentation to the independent board committee, providing financial analyses of certain factors, methodologies and other information for possible consideration by the independent board committee in evaluating the proposals. counsel provided advice as to procedure and responded to questions concerning legal aspects of the proposals and related transactions. on 5 march 2007, in a telephone conversation with a representative of morgan stanley, the fund indicated that although such fund currently intended to vote against the scheme, it reserved the right to reconsider its position in light of the additional information it would receive, including the information contained in the scheme documentation. on 16 march 2007, after discussion and review of the final draft of the independent financial adviser&#146;s letter to the independent board committee, the independent board committee, by unanimous vote, determined the share offer price to be fair and reasonable to the scheme shareholders (including without limitation ads holders) and the option offer price to be fair and reasonable to the optionholders and to recommend that the scheme shareholders (including without limitation ads holders) vote in favour of both the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting and the special resolution to, among other matters, approve the capital reduction arising as a result of the scheme at the special general meeting and recommend the optionholders to accept the option proposal if they have not exercised their options in accordance with the rules of the share option 49 part vii &#150; us special factors scheme. the recommendations of the independent board committee are set out in its letter dated 19 march 2007. on 19 march 2007, clsa issued its opinion letter to the independent board committee. see &#147;part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee&#148;. 1.1.2 agreements involving asiasat&#146;s securities as described in more detail below under &#147;effects of the proposals&#148;, as soon as practicable after the scheme becomes effective, citic group and gecc intend to cause the company to apply to the stock exchange for the withdrawal of the listing of the asiasat shares on the stock exchange and to apply for the de-listing of the adss from the nyse. in addition, provided the relevant conditions are satisfied, citic group and gecc shall procure that asiasat terminates or suspends its reporting obligations under the exchange act. citic group and gecc also intend to seek to cause the company to terminate the ads deposit agreement. concurrently with the nyse de-listing, citic group and gecc intend to file a form 15 with the sec to terminate or suspend asiasat&#146;s sec reporting obligations under the exchange act in the event the relevant conditions are satisfied. irrespective of the outcome of the scheme, in due course, it is expected that the maintenance of the ads listing on the nyse will be re-examined by asiasat and the board, the outcome of which may be to terminate such listing. upon the completion of the exchange transaction, the shareholders&#146; agreement will be terminated. citic group and the ge entities will execute a new shareholders&#146; agreement in respect of bowenvale, to become effective upon the completion of the exchange transaction, and which will be substantially similar to the shareholders&#146; agreement. in addition, on 13 february 2007, ge equity, able star, citic group, general electric company and the offeror entered into a shareholders&#146; agreement with respect to the offeror pursuant to which the parties respective rights and obligations (whether direct or indirect) in respect of the offeror and in respect of asiasat would be regulated. please see section &#147;1.1.1 past contacts, transactions and negotiations&#148; above for a description of the material terms of such shareholders&#146; agreement. 1.2 purposes, reasons for, benefits of and alternatives to the proposals due to the persistent oversupply of transponder capacity and the slow introduction of new applications in the region, the asia-pacific satellite market remains very competitive. as a result, the company&#146;s share price has not performed satisfactorily. in the three year period prior to the announcement date, the price of asiasat shares decreased by 11.9 per cent compared with an increase of 51.1 per cent in the hang seng index over the same period. given the overcapacity in the market, able star and ge equity believe that the unsatisfactory share performance of asiasat&#146;s shares may continue. asiasat&#146;s dividend yield remains relatively low as the company needs to preserve cash to endure competition in the market for commercial supply of satellite transponder capacity, to launch new satellites from time to time and to participate in potential acquisitions. therefore, the earnings of asiasat will continue to be under pressure in the short to medium term. for similar reasons, the offeror currently has no plans to increase the company&#146;s annual or interim dividend, cause the company to distribute any extraordinary dividend, or recapitalise the company&#146;s balance sheet by increasing the company&#146;s financial leverage in the ordinary course of business in the event the transfer completes and/or the scheme becomes effective. able star and ge equity propose to effect the privatisation through the scheme to enable asiasat to pursue development of its business with greater flexibility, and to effect the privatisation at a price in excess of the possible mgo share offer price in order to give minority shareholders a premium price for their asiasat shares. the scheme provides an opportunity for asiasat shareholders to exit and monetise their asiasat shares at a significant premium to the current market price. this price represents a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.00 per asiasat share on the pre-suspension date, a premium of 29.8 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.10 per asiasat share on the suspension date, a premium of 32.2 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price, and a premium of 22.0 per cent over the highest closing price during the year prior to the announcement. the scheme also provides scheme shareholders with an opportunity to receive an offer price higher than the possible mgo share offer price. if the exchange transaction is completed but the scheme is unsuccessful, the possible mgo offers would be made and the scheme shareholders would have the choice of accepting the possible mgo share offer at a lower price per asiasat share than the share offer price. the privatisation would also, if it completes, relieve asiasat of the heavy financial and administrative burden of dual listings on both the stock exchange and the nyse. in particular, compliance costs of the us sarbanes- 50 part vii &#150; us special factors oxley act of 2002 and the maintenance costs of the listing on the nyse have, in recent years, resulted in substantial recurrent professional fees and time costs, which in the view of the offeror are disproportionate to the benefits of maintaining such listing. as a private company, asiasat management should have greater flexibility to focus on the development of business and marketing activities. this is particularly important given that asiasat is operating in a competitive market in which profitability is under pressure as a result of persistent overcapacity and the substantial investment required to construct and launch new satellites. as at the latest practicable date, bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it hold an aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued share capital of asiasat. if any third party were to make a competing offer for the privatisation of asiasat, such competing offer would not succeed without the acceptance by bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it. bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it have no intention to accept any competing offer. 1.3 fairness the scheme and proposals will be treated as a &#147;going-private&#148; transaction under the applicable rules and regulations of the exchange act. the company and the offeror are required, and under a potential interpretation of such rules, the offeror&#146;s shareholders, able star and ge equity, may be required, to state their respective beliefs as to the fairness of the proposals to the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) and optionholders. the company, the offeror, and the offeror&#146;s shareholders, able star and ge equity, are making the statements included in this section for the purposes of complying with the requirements of rule 13e-3 and related rules under the exchange act. 1.3.1 the offeror the views of the offeror, and the offeror&#146;s shareholders, able star and ge equity, as to the fairness of the scheme and the proposals should not be construed as a recommendation to any asiasat shareholder, ads holder or optionholder as to how that security holder should vote on the proposal to adopt the scheme. the offeror and its shareholders, able star and ge equity, have interests in the scheme and the proposals different from, and in addition to, those of the asiasat shareholders, ads holders and optionholders. these interests are described under &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement; 13. interests of the offeror and its concert parties in asiasat&#148;. the offeror, able star and ge equity believe that the proposals are substantively and procedurally fair to the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) based on the following factors: &#149; persistent oversupply of transponder capacity, slow introduction of new applications and competitive price pressure in the asian satellite industry have resulted in unsatisfactory trading performance of asiasat in the past few years. in the three-year period prior to the announcement date, the price of asiasat shares decreased by 11.9 per cent compared with an increase of 51.1 per cent in the hang seng index over the same period; &#149; overcapacity in the market may continue and the earnings of asiasat will continue to be under pressure in the short to medium term; &#149; asiasat shares have experienced relatively low trading volumes in the last three years. the average trading volume on the stock exchange was merely 172,011 shares per day in 2006, representing 0.14 per cent of the free float of asiasat. the scheme provides scheme shareholders with a significant liquidity opportunity to dispose of their asiasat shares while at the same time achieving a substantial premium; &#149; asiasat&#146;s dividend payments remain relatively low, as the company needs to preserve cash to endure competition in the market for the commercial supply of satellite transponder capacity, to launch new satellites from time to time and to participate in potential acquisitions. for similar reasons, the offeror currently has no plans to increase the company&#146;s annual or interim dividend, cause the company to distribute any extraordinary dividend, or recapitalise the company&#146;s balance sheet by increasing the company&#146;s financial leverage in the ordinary course of business in the event the transfer completes and/or the scheme becomes effective; 51 part vii &#150; us special factors &#149; the scheme provides scheme shareholders an opportunity to receive a share offer price at a 14.4 per cent premium to the possible mgo share offer price, which is the value of the asiasat shares implied by the exchange transaction between ses and gecc; &#149; the scheme provides an opportunity for asiasat shareholders to monetise their asiasat shares at a significant premium to the current market price. this price represents a premium of 30.7 per cent over the closing price of last full trading day prior to the announcement; approximately 32.2 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price; approximately 22.0 per cent over the highest closing price during the year prior to the announcement date; and approximately 10.9 per cent over the highest closing price in the past three years prior to the announcement date; &#149; the share offer price represents a significant premium to asiasat&#146;s trading multiples over the last three years from 2004 to 2006, during which the average last twelve month trailing enterprise value (&#147; ev &#148;) to ebitda, price to earnings (&#147; p/e &#148;) and price to book value (&#147; p/bv &#148;) multiples were 5.6 times, 13.3 times and 1.4 times, respectively, while the share offer price represents last twelve month trailing ev/ebitda, p/e and p/bv multiples prior to the announcement of 6.9 times, 17.0 times and 1.7 times, respectively. the trading multiples of other regional satellite companies have been considered but the offeror does not believe that other publicly-traded satellite companies such as shin satellite plc (&#147; shinsat &#148;), measat satellite systems sdn. bhd. (&#147; measat &#148;) and jsat corporation (&#147; jsat &#148;) are appropriate comparables for asiasat. shinsat has wireless operations and is not engaged solely in the provision of transponder capacity; measat benefits from a large customer, measat broadcast network systems sdn bhd, under common control; and jsat has significant scale advantages with nine satellites, large revenue contribution from major shareholders ntt communications and affiliates, as well as global footprints spanning hawaii, oceania and north america; &#149; eight precedent merger and acquisition transactions involving global fixed satellite services companies since 2003 were priced at an average last-twelve-month trailing multiple of 8.5 times ev/ebitda. the share offer price represents a last-twelve-month trailing multiple of 6.9 times ev/ebitda prior to the announcement. the offeror believes that these global transactions were priced at a higher multiple due to three major reasons. firstly, these global transactions represented change of control transactions. secondly, these global satellite companies benefit from the stronger state of the satellite sector outside of asia. the majority of asiasat&#146;s revenue is derived from the greater china region including hong kong, mainland china and taiwan, where there is intense competition from regional satellite companies. in addition, three new satellites, sinosat-3, chinasat-6b and chinasat 9 are planned to be launched in 2007, intensifying the competition in this region. thirdly, these global satellite companies are not as highly regulated as in asia in terms of foreign ownership limits and business operations; &#149; the share offer price is consistent with precedent transactions in hong kong. the share offer price represents a premium of approximately 32.2 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price of hk$13.84 per asiasat share, which is consistent with the 35.6 per cent mean and 23.9 per cent median premiums over 30-day average pre-announcement price of the seven selected relevant hong kong non-real estate takeover transactions since 2003 where a controlling shareholder acquired the portion of the company it did not already own. the offeror believes that real estate deals are inappropriate comparables as they are largely driven by net asset value. furthermore, the offeror believes deals which involve a change of control are not applicable as citic group and ge equity would already indirectly through bowenvale have control over the company should the exchange transaction complete; &#149; the share offer price represents a significant premium of 28 per cent to the average of available research analyst price targets of hk$14.29 for asiasat shares for the time period between the release of asiasat&#146;s 2006 interim results on 24 august 2006 and the announcement date of 13 february 2007; &#149; the terms of the proposals were agreed between the offeror and asiasat in arm&#146;s length negotiations; and &#149; the scheme must, among other things, be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority in number of the scheme shareholders that represent at least three-fourths in nominal value of the scheme shares, present and voting (either in person or by proxy) at the court meeting, and not more than 10 per cent of the vote attaching to all scheme shares held by scheme shareholders may have been cast against the scheme at the court meeting, thereby presenting an opportunity for scheme shareholders to independently express their views on and approve or reject the scheme. 52 part vii &#150; us special factors the offeror, able star and the ge equity implicitly considered the &#147;going concern&#148; value of asiasat by taking into account, as discussed above, asiasat&#146;s current and anticipated business, financial conditions, results and operations and prospects, expectations of profitability, and other forward-looking matters. the liquidation value of asiasat was not considered a factor because asiasat will continue to operate as a subsidiary of the offeror and bowenvale after completion of the transactions. in addition, the offeror, able star and ge equity did not consider any other potential offers made by any unaffiliated third parties with respect to any tender offer, merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other sales of asiasat, as (i) they were not aware of any such offers and (ii) the offeror, able star and ge equity understand that it is citic group&#146;s intention to maintain its significant shareholding in the company, which would make it unlikely that any such offers would be able to succeed without citic group&#146;s consent. furthermore, if any third party were to make a competing offer for the privatisation of asiasat, such competing offer would not succeed without the acceptance by bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it. as stated in the announcement, it is the understanding of the offeror, able star and ge equity that bowenvale has no intention to accept any competing offer and it is unlikely that another offeror would make an offer to the public shareholders to acquire the public float at a price higher than the share offer price or the possible mgo share offer price. 1.3.2 additional matters in view of the many considerations, the offeror, able star and the ge equity did not find it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign weighting to the specific factors considered. these factors are not intended to be exhaustive but include the material factors considered by the offeror, able star and ge equity. except for the letter from clsa set out in &#147;part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee&#148;, neither asiasat nor any of its affiliates (as defined in the us federal securities laws) has sought or obtained a fairness opinion or appraisal from any third party adviser (including morgan stanley) in connection with the proposals. the offeror, able star and the ge entities have not made any provisions to grant scheme shareholders or ads holders access to their corporate files or obtain any counsel or to provide appraisal services to scheme shareholders or ads holders and do not have any intention of doing so in the future. 1.3.3 asiasat on 16 march 2007, at a meeting of the board, the board unanimously determined that the proposals by means of the scheme are fair and reasonable to the scheme shareholders (including without limitation ads holders) and recommended the approval and adoption of the scheme by the scheme shareholders, based on the independent board committee&#146;s recommendation. the independent board committee in reaching the recommendations described in &#147;part v &#150; letter from the independent board committee&#148; of this scheme document, the independent board committee considered a number of factors, including the following: (i) asiasat operating and financial condition . the independent board committee took into account the current and historical financial condition and results of operations of asiasat, as well as the prospects and strategic objectives of asiasat, including the risks involved in achieving those prospects and objectives, and the current and expected conditions in the general economy and in the sectors in which asiasat operates or has interests. (ii) clsa financial analysis and opinion. the independent board committee considered the presentation delivered on 3 march 2007 by clsa to the independent board committee and clsa&#146;s written opinion dated 2 march 2007 to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the matters stated in such opinion, the consideration to be received by the scheme shareholders and the optionholders in the proposals is fair and reasonable to the scheme shareholders and the optionholders. the independent board committee adopted the analysis of clsa and its conclusions. the full text of the letter delivered by clsa to the independent board committee dated 19 march 2007, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is set forth in part vi of this scheme document. clsa&#146;s letter is addressed to the independent board committee and relates only to the fairness and reasonableness of the 53 part vii &#150; us special factors proposals to the scheme shareholders and the optionholders. among other things, clsa did not consider, and its report does not address, the exchange transaction or the possible mgo offers. the description of clsa&#146;s opinion included in this scheme document is qualified in its entirety by the full text of clsa&#146;s letter set forth in part vi of this scheme document. holders of scheme shares and options are urged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. see &#147;part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee&#148;. (iii) relation to certain market prices . the independent board committee considered the relationship of the share offer price and the option offer price to the historical market prices of the asiasat shares. the asiasat shares are listed on the stock exchange; there is no public trading market for the asiasat shares outside hong kong. the adss have a trading market and a listing on the nyse. the following table shows the price per asiasat share and per ads in respect of: &#149; the pre-suspension date, &#149; the suspension date, &#149; the 30-day average pre-announcement price, &#149; the average daily closing price during the period from 1 january 2005 to the pre-suspension date, &#149; the highest daily closing price during the period from 1 january 2005 to the pre-suspension date, and the premium that the share offer price of hk$18.30 per scheme share represents and offer price per ads of hk$183.00 per ads represents over the above. asiasat shares ads price (hk$) premium (a) price (us$) premium (a) pre-suspension date (8 february 2007) 14.00 30.7 % 17.75 31.9 % suspension date (9 february 2007) 14.10 29.8 % 17.75 35.7 % 30-day average pre-announcement price 13.84 32.2 % 17.93 34.3 % average daily closing price 1 january 2005 &#150; pre-suspension date 13.81 32.5 % 17.77 35.5 % highest daily closing price 1 january 2005 &#150; pre-suspension date 15.95 14.7 % 20.45 17.7 % (a) premium based on conversion of the share offer price per ads to us dollars at the bloomberg rate on the pre-suspension date of us$1.00 = hk$ 7.82. (iv) premium to net asset value . the independent board committee considered the relationship of the share offer price and the option offer price to the net asset value per share of the asiasat shares in the light of the premiums to net asset value represented by the acquisition prices in precedent privatisation transactions in hong kong. the independent financial adviser compiled a list of the precedent transactions disclosing acquisitions premiums which ranged from a discount of 70.3 per cent to a premium of 188.8 per cent to net asset value, with an average premium of 13.6 per cent and a medium premium of 0.3 per cent. the acquisition premium of the asiasat shares represented by the share offer price and the option offer price is 65.3 per cent. (v) discounted cash flow valuation . the independent board committee evaluated asiasat as a going concern through the discounted cash flow analysis prepared by the independent financial adviser in connection with its fairness and reasonableness opinion, which took into account financial forecasts, cash flow streams and other qualitative factors. see &#147;part vi &#150; letter from the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee&#148;. (vi) likely effect on the market price of the asiasat shares if the proposals were withdrawn . the independent board committee considered the possible trading prices of the asiasat shares in the short- through the long-term if the proposals were to be withdrawn or rejected. the independent board committee concluded that the trading value of the asiasat shares likely would decline in the short- and medium-term as a result of a withdrawal or rejection of the proposals. the independent board committee was mindful of the fact that if the scheme shareholders do not approve the scheme and the transfer completed, the offeror would undertake the possible mgo offers, and that the possible mgo share offer price would be hk$2.30 less per share than the share offer price. the independent board committee also took note of the fact that in the event the public float is less than 25 per cent trading in the asiasat shares might be suspended as well as the possibility that the offeror might be in a position to make use of the compulsory acquisition provisions of the companies act. 54 part vii &#150; us special factors (vii) condition to completion . the independent board committee took note of the fact that a condition to the completion of the scheme is that the scheme receive the approval by way of poll of the scheme by a majority in number of the scheme shareholders representing not less than three-fourths in value of the scheme shares, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the court meeting, provided that the scheme is approved by at least 75 per cent of the votes attaching to scheme shares held by scheme shareholders that are cast either in person or by proxy at the court meeting, and the number of votes cast against the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting is not more than 10 per cent of the votes attaching to all scheme shares held by scheme shareholders. (viii) court sanction. the independent board committee took note of the fact that another one of the conditions to the completion of the scheme is that following approval by the scheme shareholders at the court meeting, the scheme is sanctioned by the supreme court and that the supreme court may decline to sanction the scheme unless it is satisfied that the results of the court meeting fairly reflects the views of the parties concerned. (ix) 26 february 2007 letter . the independent board committee took note of the fact that in a letter dated 26 february 2007 to the offeror and copied to the board, notwithstanding the &#147;no increase&#148; statement a person claiming to be a significant scheme shareholder had expressed the view that it believes the share offer price is inadequate, based on among other things the intrinsic value of the asiasat shares, and also noted, in this regard, that clsa had delivered its letter to the independent board committee setting forth its opinion that the terms and conditions of the proposals, in particular the share proposal price and the option proposal price, are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders and the optionholders are concerned and, in arriving at that opinion, clsa had, among other things, performed a discounted cash flow analysis that showed the share offer price to be within the range of intrinsic value of asiasat identified by clsa. (x) form of the consideration; taxable transactions. the independent board committee took into consideration that the holders of scheme shares would be paid in cash for the scheme shares and options under the proposals, and the certainty of value of such cash consideration compared to equity securities. the independent board committee was aware that the consideration received by holders of scheme shares and options in the proposals would be taxable to some holders for income tax purposes. (xi) absence of alternative transactions . the independent board committee took into consideration the fact that with ownership of approximately 68.9 per cent of the asiasat shares in the hands of two controlling shareholders through bowenvale, the likelihood of a competing transaction was remote as was the prospect of pursuing any strategic alternative not consistent with the interests of the controlling shareholders. the independent board committee took note of the statement in the announcement that bowenvale had no intention of accepting a competing offer. the independent board committee also took into consideration the fact that although one of the two controlling shareholders (ses) was exiting its investment in asiasat, it was doing so in a transaction that would result in the substitution of a new controlling shareholder (a ge entity) for such exiting shareholder. as a result, the independent board committee did not evaluate the prices potentially attainable in any alternative transaction. (xii) procedural fairness . the independent board committee considered that: &#149; the independent board committee consisted of the three non-executive independent directors of asiasat appointed to represent the interests of the scheme shareholders; and &#149; the independent board committee had retained and was advised by clsa, as its independent financial advisor, with the sole objective of rendering an opinion as to the fairness and reasonableness of the proposals to the scheme shareholders and optionholders. (xiii) timing of completion . the independent board committee considered the anticipated timing of consummation of the proposals, which should allow holders of scheme shares and options to receive the share offer price and the option offer price within a reasonable period of time. (xiv) limited conditions to consummation . the independent board committee considered the fact that the offeror&#146;s obligation to consummate the proposals is subject to a limited number of conditions, with no financing condition. the independent board committee also considered the fact that morgan stanley is satisfied that sufficient financial resources are and will be available to the offeror to implement the proposals. 55 part vii &#150; us special factors the members of the independent board committee evaluated the proposals in light of their knowledge of the business, financial condition and prospects of asiasat. in view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with the evaluation of the proposals, the independent board committee did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign numerical weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its determination. the foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the independent board committee is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors considered by the independent board committee. the board the board adopted the foregoing recommendations of the independent board committee after considering the following factors, each of which, in the view of the board, supported such adoption: &#149; the conclusions and recommendations of the independent board committee; and &#149; the factors referred to above as having been taken into account by the independent board committee. the board did not independently analyse the factors taken into account by the independent board committee. instead, the board adopted the analysis of the independent board committee and its conclusions. the members of the board, including the members of the independent board committee, considered the proposals in light of their knowledge of the business, financial condition and prospects of asiasat, and based upon the advice of financial and legal advisors. neither the independent board committee nor the board considered the liquidation of asiasat&#146;s assets to be a viable course of action. therefore, no appraisal of liquidation values was sought for purposes of evaluating the proposals. in view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with their evaluation of the proposals, neither the independent board committee nor the board found it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the specific factors they considered in reaching their determinations. the foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the independent board committee and the board is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors considered by the independent board committee and the board. executive officers have not been asked to make a recommendation as to the proposals. independent board committee compensation the members of the independent board committee did not receive compensation in connection with serving on the independent board committee. summary of report and opinion of the independent financial adviser under an engagement letter, dated 21 february 2007, the independent board committee retained clsa to render an opinion as to whether or not the terms and conditions of the proposals, and more particularly, the cancellation price of hk$18.30 per scheme share, hk$183.00 per ads, hk$0.82 per outstanding b option and hk$3.95 per outstanding c option, are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders and optionholders, respectively, are concerned. in connection with the preparation and delivery of its opinion to the independent board committee, clsa performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, as described below. the preparation of a fairness and reasonableness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis, and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. furthermore, in arriving at its opinion, clsa did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor 56 part vii &#150; us special factors considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. accordingly, clsa believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. in formulating its opinion with regard to the proposals, clsa relied on the information, opinions and facts supplied, and representations made to it by the directors and representatives of asiasat (including those contained or referred to in this scheme document and the announcement). clsa assumed that all such information, opinions, facts and representations that were provided to it by the directors, and representatives of asiasat, and for which they are wholly responsible, are true and accurate in all material respects. clsa also relied on certain information available to the public and assumed such information to be accurate and reliable, and has not independently verified the accuracy of such information. further, clsa relied on the representations of the directors of asiasat that they have made all reasonable inquiries, and that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no other facts, the omission of which would make any statement contained in the scheme document or the announcement untrue or misleading. it also assumed that statements and representations made or referred to in the scheme document and the announcement were accurate at the time they were made and continue to be accurate as of the date of despatch of the scheme document. clsa considers that it has reviewed sufficient information to enable it to reach an informed view regarding the proposals to justify its recommendation, relying on the accuracy of the information provided in the scheme document and the announcement, as well as to provide a reasonable basis for its advice. as the independent financial adviser to the independent board committee, it has not been involved in the negotiations in respect of the terms and conditions of the proposals. its opinion with regard to the terms and conditions thereof has been made on the assumption that all obligations to be performed by asiasat and the offeror in relation to the proposals will be fully performed in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. further, clsa has no reason to suspect that any material facts or information have been omitted or withheld from the information supplied or opinions expressed to it, nor to doubt the truth, accuracy and completeness of the information, facts and representations provided, or the reasonableness of the opinions expressed, to it by asiasat, its directors and its representatives. in line with normal practice, clsa has not made any independent verification of the information and facts provided, representations made or opinions expressed by asiasat, its directors and its representatives, nor has it conducted any form of independent investigation into the business affairs or assets and liabilities of asiasat. accordingly, clsa does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any such information. clsa&#146;s opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the information publicly available to it as of the date of this opinion. as a result, circumstances could develop prior to completion of the proposals that, if known to clsa at the time it rendered its opinion, would have altered its opinion. clsa&#146;s opinion is directed to the independent board committee, addresses only the fairness and reasonableness of the consideration to be received by scheme shareholders and optionholders in the proposals and does not address the relative merits of the proposals or any other transaction that may have been available as an alternative to the proposals, whether or not any such alternative could be or could have been achieved, or the terms upon which any such alternative transaction could be or could have been achieved. further, clsa&#146;s opinion addresses only issues related to the fairness and reasonableness to the scheme shareholders and optionholders of the proposals. materials summarising clsa&#146;s analyses were presented to the independent board committee and the board on 3 march 2007. copies of these materials have been filed with the sec as an exhibit to the schedule 13e-3. copies of these materials are available for inspection and copying at asiasat&#146;s principal executive offices, during regular business hours, by any interested asiasat shareholder or representative who has been so designated in writing. scheme shareholders may also obtain these materials from the sec under asiasat&#146;s sec filings. clsa, in connection with the potential transaction, has delivered to the independent board committee a written opinion, dated 19 march 2007, to the effect that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review set forth therein and described to 57 part vii &#150; us special factors the independent board committee, the share proposal price and the option proposal price to be received under the proposals are fair and reasonable to the scheme shareholders and the optionholders, respectively. the summary of the opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. shareholders are urged to read such opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed, the factors considered, the assumptions made, and the limitations on the analysis undertaken by clsa. clsa&#146;s written opinion is for the information and assistance of the independent board committee and the board. clsa&#146;s opinion does not address the independent board committee&#146;s, the board&#146;s or asiasat&#146;s underlying business decision to proceed with the proposals. clsa has not been requested to, and did not, participate in the process to explore strategic alternatives for asiasat nor did it actively solicit third party indications of interest in acquiring all or any part of asiasat. in connection with the preparation of its opinion, clsa made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as its representatives deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. among other things clsa: &#149; reviewed asiasat&#146;s audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended 2000 through 2006, the annual reports on form 20-f for the fiscal years 2000 to 2005 and of asiasat&#146;s unaudited financial statements for the two months ended 28 february 2007, which asiasat&#146;s management has identified as being the most current financial statements available; &#149; met with certain members of asiasat&#146;s management and auditors to discuss the operations, financial condition, future prospects and projected operations and performance of asiasat; &#149; reviewed the historical market prices and trading volume for the asiasat shares and the adss; &#149; reviewed certain other publicly available financial data for certain companies that clsa deemed comparable to asiasat; &#149; reviewed various documents relating to asiasat; &#149; reviewed the company&#146;s current financial projections and its past financial projections against actual performance; and &#149; conducted such other studies, analyses and inquiries as they deemed appropriate. summary of certain financial analyses conducted by clsa in assessing the fairness and reasonableness of the consideration to the scheme shareholders and optionholders under the proposals, clsa independently valued asiasat using widely accepted valuation methodologies. reasons for the proposals as described in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; of this scheme document, the principal reasons for the proposals are that, due to the persistent oversupply of transponder capacity and the slow introduction of new applications in the region, the asia-pacific satellite market remains very competitive. such competition is cited as the reason for the underperformance of the company&#146;s share price which, in the three year period prior to the announcement date, decreased by 11.9 per cent compared to an increase of 51.1 per cent in the hang seng index over the same period. based on its discussions with asiasat&#146;s management, clsa does not expect a dramatic improvement in the competitive environment in which the company operates in the near term. given the overcapacity in the market, able star and ge equity believe that the unsatisfactory share performance of asiasat&#146;s shares may continue. in the view of the offeror, asiasat&#146;s dividend yield remains relatively low as the company needs to preserve cash to endure competition in the market for commercial supply of satellite transponder capacity, to launch new satellites from time to time and to participate in potential acquisitions. able star and ge equity therefore believe that the earnings of asiasat will continue to be under pressure in the short to medium term. as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; of this scheme document, able star and ge equity propose to effect a privatisation through the scheme to enable asiasat to pursue development of its business with greater 58 part vii &#150; us special factors flexibility, and to effect the privatisation at a price in excess of the possible mgo share offer price in order to give minority shareholders a premium price for their asiasat shares. a further reason advanced for the proposals is that the privatisation would also, if it completes, relieve asiasat of the financial and administrative burden of dual listings on both the stock exchange and the nyse. in particular, as stated in the explanatory statement, the listing on the nyse has, in recent years, resulted in substantial recurrent professional fees and time costs, which, in the view of able star and ge equity are disproportionate to the benefits of maintaining such listing. the final reason advanced in for the proposals is that, as a private company, asiasat management should have greater flexibility to focus on the development of business and marketing activities, which is cited as being particularly important given that asiasat is operating in a competitive market in which profitability is under pressure as a result of persistent oversupply of transponder capacity and the substantial investment required to construct and launch new satellites. intentions of the offeror regarding asiasat as stated in &#147;part viii &#150; explanatory statement&#148; of this scheme document, it is the intention of the citic group and gecc to maintain the existing businesses of the asiasat group upon the successful privatisation of the company. citic group and gecc do not intend to introduce any major changes to the existing operating and management structure of the asiasat group, or to discontinue the employment of any employees of the asiasat group, as a result of the implementation of the proposals. upon the successful implementation of the proposals and asiasat becoming a private company, asiasat will no longer have access to equity funding through the public capital markets. citic group and gecc also expect that there will be no material change to the existing business (such as business focus and operating mode) of the asiasat group as a result of the implementation of the proposals. clsa noted that subject to the privatisation of the company, citic group and gecc contemplate that they will assess whether to revise asiasat&#146;s bye-laws to reflect its change from a public to a private company. clsa also noted that citic group and gecc intend to retain the company&#146;s existing senior management team to manage the company after the implementation of the proposals. precedent privatisation premiums clsa identified from publicly available sources all successful privatisation transactions, to the best of its knowledge, by scheme of arrangements on the main board of the stock exchange announced since 1 january 2003 up to and including the date of the announcement (the &#147; precedent privatisations &#148;), and reviewed the premiums represented by the acquisition price over the nav per share and the average daily closing price of various periods of the precedent privatisations. clsa found that the premium of 65.3 per cent as represented by the share offer price over the nav per asiasat share, is substantially higher than the median premiums over nav per share of the precedent privatisations (&#147; nav premiums &#148;) of 0.3 per cent, and is on the high end of the nav premiums range of -70.3 per cent to 188.8 per cent. on the other hand, the premiums represented by the share offer price over the average daily closing price of the asiasat shares at various periods are below the average and median premiums over the average daily closing price of the precedent privatisations (&#147; share premiums &#148;) at various periods, but are within the range of the share premiums. precedent transactions in the satellite industry clsa identified, from publicly available sources, completed transactions since 2004 that involved the acquisition of more than a 30 per cent interest in companies that mainly provide satellite services and with a transaction value of over us$100 million (approximately hk$780 million) (the &#147; precedent transactions &#148;) and reviewed the key multiples of the precedent transactions. it summarised certain information for the precedent transactions, including ev/ebitda and p/e. it found that the ev/ebitda represented by the share offer price of 6.38 times 59 part vii &#150; us special factors is lower than those of the precedent transactions; while the p/e represented by the share offer price of 15.78 times is lower than those of the precedent transactions. however, as all of the precedent transactions involved european and us targets that enjoy more favourable operating conditions than satellite operators in the asia-pacific region, in which clsa was not able to identify recent precedent transactions, clsa considered the precedent transactions to be of limited relevance to the proposals for comparison purposes. clsa also noted that, unlike the share proposal, the majority of the precedent transactions involved the acquisition of a controlling interest in the target. share proposal price compared to comparable companies clsa identified from publicly available sources all listed companies mainly engaged in the provision of satellite services with a market capitalisation of more than us$100 million in europe, the united states and asia-pacific (the &#147; comparable companies &#148;) and reviewed the key multiples of the comparable companies. for the comparable companies, it summarised market capitalisation, and p/e for 2006 and 2007. based on these comparables, clsa found that the p/e represented by the share offer price is lower than those of the comparable companies. historical trading liquidity and trading price of asiasat shares clsa evaluated information on the daily historical closing prices and trading volumes of asiasat shares traded on the stock exchange between from 1 january 2005 to the pre-suspension date (the &#147; review period &#148;). it also presented the average, highest and lowest daily closing prices and the average daily traded volume of the shares for each quarter during the review period. based on this information clsa noted that the share offer price represents a premium of: &#149; approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of asiasat shares of hk$14.00 as quoted on the stock exchange on the pre-suspension date; &#149; approximately 32.5 per cent over the average daily closing price of asiasat shares of hk$13.81 during the review period; &#149; approximately 14.7 per cent over the highest daily closing price of asiasat shares of hk$15.95 during the review period; and &#149; approximately 14.4 per cent over the possible mgo share offer price of hk$16.00. clsa also noted that during the review period, asiasat shares traded within the range of hk$12.20 to hk$15.95 (the highest price being achieved in august 2005), and the closing price as at the pre-suspension date was hk$14.00. following the date of the announcement, the price of asiasat shares has significantly increased, and as at the latest practicable date, the closing price of asiasat shares was hk$17.54. clsa noted as well that the average daily trading volume of asiasat shares during the review period was about 175,000 asiasat shares, but had significantly increased to about 251,000 asiasat shares between the date of the announcement to the latest practicable date. dcf analysis clsa also analysed the share offer price using the dcf methodology. clsa performed the dcf analysis based on projections provided by management of asiasat, as adjusted based on its discussions with asiasat management regarding asiasat&#146;s operating environment, business expansion plans and other factors, but have not independently verified the information used. clsa then applied different discount rates and terminal growth rates to derive an indicative valuation range for asiasat shares. it found that the share offer price falls within its dcf analysis result range. the dcf analysis should not be regarded as an indication of what price asiasat shares should or could be achieved or indications of profit forecast. other considerations clsa also considered that the offeror has no current intention to introduce any major change to the existing operating and management structures of asiasat irrespective of whether or not the scheme becomes effective. it also noted that, as at the latest practicable date, bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it hold an 60 part vii &#150; us special factors aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued share capital of asiasat. therefore, if any third party were to make a competing offer for the privatisation of asiasat, such competing offer would not succeed without the acceptance by bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it, and bowenvale has stated that it has no intention to accept any competing offer. finally, clsa noted that the offeror will not increase any of the offer prices, except that the offeror has stated that it reserves the right not to be bound by these statements in the event of a competing offer and such competing offer is recommended by the board. conclusions and opinion in reaching its opinion (on the basis set out at the beginning of this summary), clsa considered the above principal factors and reasons and, in particular, took into account the following in arriving at its opinion: &#149; the reasons for the proposals, in particular the competitive environment for satellite service providers in the asia-pacific region due to the persistent oversupply of transponder capacity and the slow introduction of new applications in the region; &#149; the historical trading performance of asiasat shares and persistent low levels of liquidity in asiasat shares; &#149; the share offer price represents a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.00 of asiasat shares as quoted on the stock exchange on the pre-suspension date, a premium of approximately 32.5 per cent over the average daily closing price of asiasat shares of hk$13.81 during the review period, a premium of approximately 14.7 per cent over the highest daily closing price of asiasat shares of hk$15.95 during the review period, and a premium of approximately 14.4 per cent over the possible mgo share offer price of hk$16.00; &#149; the share offer price represents a premium over the nav per share (after adjusting for dividends), which is substantially higher than the median premiums over nav per share offered in the precedent privatisations, and is on the high end of the premiums over nav per share per share range of the precedent privatisations; &#149; the premium represented by the share offer price over the price of asiasat shares as of the pre-suspension date and average daily closing prices of asiasat shares over various periods falls within the range of relevant premiums of the precedent privatisations; &#149; while the ev/ebitda and p/e represented by the share offer price is lower than those of the precedent transactions, all of the precedent transactions involved european and us targets that enjoy more favourable operating conditions than satellite operators in the asia-pacific region; &#149; the p/e represented by the share offer price is lower than that of the comparable companies; &#149; the share offer price is within the dcf analysis result range based on the projections provided to clsa by the management of asiasat; &#149; the option offer price represents cash equal to the cash payment which optionholders would receive if they had exercised their outstanding options and accepted the share proposal in respect of those shares arising as a result of such exercise; &#149; as bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it hold an aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued share capital of asiasat, if any third party were to make a competing offer for the privatisation of asiasat, such competing offer would not succeed without the acceptance by bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it, and bowenvale has stated that it and parties acting in concert with it have no intention to accept any competing offer; &#149; the offeror will not be allowed to increase any of the offer prices, save in wholly exceptional circumstances, as provided in rule 18.3 of the takeovers code; and &#149; the proposals offer the scheme shareholders and the optionholders an opportunity to exit and monetise their investment in asiasat shares and options at the share offer price and the option offer price, respectively. having considered the above, clsa is of the opinion that the terms and conditions of the proposals, in particular the share proposal price and the option proposal price, are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme 61 part vii &#150; us special factors shareholders and the optionholders, respectively, are concerned. accordingly, clsa advised the independent board committee to recommend to the scheme shareholders to approve the scheme at the court meeting and to vote in favour of the special resolution to approve and give effect to the scheme at the special general meeting to be convened on 24 april 2007 and recommend to the optionholders to accept the option proposal for any options outstanding as at the day of the hearing of the petition for the sanction of the scheme by the supreme court. 1.3.4 certain projections at the november 2006 meeting of the asiasat board of directors, management provided, as is customary on an annual basis, the directors with a five-year business plan. the business plan was prepared and provided by management well before management was first advised of the proposals. between november 2006 and the initial contact between representatives of the offeror and asiasat concerning the proposals, some of the directors who received the business plan, later became directors of the offeror. they did not, however, share the business plan with the offeror or the other directors of the offeror. in addition, as directors, the members of the independent board committee had copies of the business plan, and a copy of the business plan was made available to clsa. as a result of the foregoing, projections included in the business plan are included in this scheme document. the following sets forth the material portions of the projections contained in the business plan (hk$ in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 revenue 923,109 973,647 1,031,384 1,126,021 1,251,119 operating expenses (net)

operating performance, leverage and liquidity. ebidta is not intended to represent cash flow for the period, nor has it been presented as an alternative to earnings after tax as an indicator of operating performance. the items of earnings after tax excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing the financial performance of the group, and this computation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. the projections included in this scheme document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the company&#146;s management. management had advised the directors that its internal financial forecasts were prepared solely for internal use in business planning and are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revision based on actual experience and business developments. the company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose projections of future revenues, earnings or other financial performance. the projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this scheme document because representatives of the offeror had access to such projections and such projections were also made available to clsa. the projections were not prepared with a view to complying with published guidelines of the sec or the guidelines established by the american institute of certified public accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or generally accepted accounting principles. neither the company&#146;s independent auditors nor any other independent accountants have examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the financial information contained in the projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with respect to the projections, the assumptions 62 part vii &#150; us special factors underlying the projections or the achievability of the projections. these projections have been included in this scheme document by reason of the applicability of rule 13e-3 of the exchange act to the proposals (as they were provided to certain members of the board of the offeror and clsa) and is not strictly in compliance with the disclosure requirements of rule 10 and rule 11 of the takeovers code. in compiling the projections, the company&#146;s management took into account historical performance, combined with estimates, among others, regarding revenues and net income. furthermore: &#149; the projections were developed in a manner consistent with management&#146;s historical development of internal financial forecasts used in the preparation of annual budgets. &#149; the projections are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. &#149; although the projections are presented with numerical specificity, these projections reflect numerous assumptions and estimates relating to company&#146;s business made by the company&#146;s management that company&#146;s management believed were reasonable at the time the projections were prepared. &#149; factors such as industry performance, competitive uncertainties and general business, economic, political, regulatory, market and financial conditions, all of which are difficult to predict and beyond the control of company&#146;s management, may cause actual results to vary from the projections or the underlying assumptions. see &#147;important notices; information for us asiasat shareholders and ads holders&#148;. accordingly, while the projections were prepared in good faith by company&#146;s management, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made in preparing the projections will prove to be accurate or that the projections will be realised, and actual results may be materially greater or less than those contained in the projections. the inclusion of this information in this scheme document should not be regarded as an indication that the projections will be predictive of actual future results, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. moreover, the independent board committee and clsa may have varied some of the assumptions underlying the projections for purposes of their analyses set forth in this document. as part of a business plan prepared for internal purposes, the projections reflect management&#146;s view of the business as of november 2006. as such, the projections do not reflect the privatisation nor do they reflect any possible strategic initiatives that have been considered, or are under consideration, by management. except to the extent required by applicable law, the company does not intend to update or otherwise revise any of the projections included in this scheme document to reflect circumstances existing after the date when such projections were made or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in error or otherwise no longer appropriate. the basis for accounting for the financial information contained in the business plan is consistent with the accounting policies normally adopted by the company. the company&#146;s underlying financial statements are prepared in accordance with hkfrs. the following assumptions, among others, were used by the company&#146;s management in developing the foregoing projections: &#149; the company will continue to operate with three satellites for its existing transponder leasing business; &#149; asiasat 5 will be launched in the second half of 2009; &#149; expenses in connection with staff on-site monitoring and overseas training in connection with asiasat 5, such as staff costs, passages, accommodations, etc. will be capitalised; &#149; there will be improvement in demand for transponder capacity in the asian region; &#149; the direct-to-home business will operate with four broadcast satellite service transponders in the business plan; and &#149; tai po scc phase ii is excluded. in addition, the projections were based on a number of assumptions regarding the broader operating environment of asiasat, including the following: &#149; there will be no material change in existing political, legal and fiscal, market, economic or social conditions in markets serviced by the group; 63 part vii &#150; us special factors &#149; there will be no change in legislation, regulations or rules in markets serviced by the group which adversely affect the business of the group; &#149; there will be no material change in the bases or rates of taxation applicable to the group and the tax dispute with the indian tax authorities will be resolved in favour of the group; and &#149; there will be no material changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates from those currently prevailing. 1.4 effects of the proposals 1.4.1 participation in asiasat upon the scheme becoming effective and binding, citic group and gecc will own indirectly 100 per cent of the issued share capital of the company. if the scheme is completed, the scheme shareholders will cease to have ownership interests in the company and rights as the company&#146;s shareholders, and, as a result, scheme shareholders will not participate in any future earnings, losses, growth or decline of the company. moreover, the company intends to have the adss de-listed from the nyse following completion of the scheme. as a result, public trading of the adss will cease. the company&#146;s net income was hk$453,405,000 for the year ended 31 december 2006 and the shareholders&#146; equity was hk$4,421,604,000 as of 31 december 2006. as of 31 december 2006, bowenvale was the holder of approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company. pursuant to the share proposal, each of the scheme shareholders (being holders of the approximately 31.1 per cent of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company), totalling 121,360,500 asiasat shares) will receive hk$18.30 in cash for each asiasat share it holds. if the scheme becomes effective, citic group and gecc&#146;s indirect interest in the company&#146;s net income and in the company&#146;s shareholders&#146; equity will equal to 100 per cent. after the transaction, citic group and gecc (through their respective affiliates) will be entitled to all benefits resulting from such interest, including all income generated by the company&#146;s operations and any future increase in the company&#146;s value. similarly, citic group and gecc (through their respective affiliates) will also bear all the risks of losses generated by the company&#146;s operations and any future decrease in the value of the company after the transaction. if the scheme becomes effective, the scheme shareholders will have no interest in asiasat&#146;s net book value or net earnings. the table below sets forth the direct and indirect interests in asiasat&#146;s net book value and net earnings of each of bowenvale, the offeror, able star, and ge equity prior to and immediately after the privatisation, based upon the net book value of asiasat at 31 december 2006 and net income of asiasat for the year ended 31 december 2006. following the privatisation, the entire interest in asiasat net book value and net earnings will be held by citic group and gecc (through their respective affiliates).

december 2006 and profit from continuing operations for the year ended 31 december 2006, in each case as disclosed in asiasat&#146;s announcement of final results for the year ended 31 december 2006. (2) based upon asiasat&#146;s net book value at as 31 december 2006 and profit from continuing operations for the year ended 31 december 2006, in each case as disclosed in asiasat&#146;s announcement of audited results for the year ended 31 december 2006, without giving effect to the payment of any transaction expenses in connection with the privatisation. (3) includes beneficial ownership of asiasat shares held by bowenvale. 64 part vii &#150; us special factors 1.4.2 market for asiasat securities as soon as practicable after the scheme becomes effective, the company will apply to the stock exchange for the withdrawal of the listing of the asiasat shares on the stock exchange pursuant to rule 6.15 of the listing rules. scheme shareholders will be notified by way of a press announcement of the exact dates on which the scheme and the withdrawal of the listing of the asiasat shares on the stock exchange will become effective. upon the scheme becoming effective, all scheme shares will be cancelled and share certificates for the scheme shares will cease to have effect as documents of evidence of title and should be returned to the company for cancellation. upon the scheme becoming effective and the company becoming wholly owned by citic group and gecc through the offeror and bowenvale, the company will also apply for de-listing of the adss from the nyse. citic group and gecc also intend to seek to cause the company to terminate the ads deposit agreement. if the scheme becomes effective, citic group and gecc intend to cause the company to file a form 15 with the sec to request that the company&#146;s reporting obligations under the exchange act be terminated or suspended, provided the relevant rules and regulations under the exchange act are satisfied. irrespective of the outcome of the scheme, in due course, it is expected that the maintenance of the ads listing on the nyse will be re-examined by asiasat and the board, the outcome of which may be to terminate such listing. 1.4.3 margin regulations the adss are currently &#147;margin securities&#148; under the regulations of the federal reserve board, which has the effect, amongst other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of the adss. depending upon factors similar to those described above regarding listing and market quotations, it is likely that following effectiveness of the scheme, the adss may no longer constitute &#147;margin securities&#148; for purposes of the margin regulations of the federal reserve board and, as a result, could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers. 1.4.4 exchange act de-registration and availability of public information the adss and the asiasat shares are currently registered under the exchange act. currently, registration of such adss and asiasat shares may be terminated or suspended upon application of asiasat to the sec if the adss are neither listed on a national securities exchange (in the united states) or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system nor held by 300 or more beneficial owners in the united states or satisfy such other criteria as the sec may establish in the future. termination or suspension of registration of adss and asiasat shares under the exchange act would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by asiasat to ads holders and to the sec and would make certain provisions of the exchange act no longer applicable to asiasat. for example, asiasat would no longer be required to file an annual report on form 20-f or to make submissions of material information on form 6-k. furthermore, asiasat would not be required to file any financial statements with the sec and would not be required to reconcile its financial statements to us gaap. in addition, delisting from the nyse would render inapplicable certain corporate governance standards that currently apply to asiasat (including independence requirements for members of the audit committee). 1.4.5 no appraisal rights shareholders do not have express appraisal rights in connection with the scheme under the companies act. however, the supreme court in considering whether to sanction a scheme of arrangement may decline to sanction a scheme unless it is satisfied not only that the required court meeting was properly constituted and that the share proposal was approved by the requisite majority, but also that the result of the court meeting fairly reflected the view of the parties concerned. 1.4.6 material accounting treatment upon cancellation of the scheme shares, asiasat&#146;s issued share capital will be reduced by hk$12,136,050, the par value of the asiasat shares cancelled. there will then be an immediate issue of new asiasat shares, so that the net effect on the company&#146;s issued share capital will be nil. 65 part vii &#150; us special factors 2. tax consequences 2.1 hong kong tax consequences as the scheme does not involve the sale and purchase of hong kong stock, no stamp duty will be payable pursuant to the stamp duty ordinance (chapter 117 of the laws of hong kong) on the cancellation of the scheme shares upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. the scheme shareholders, whether in hong kong or in other jurisdictions, are recommended to consult their professional advisers if they are in any doubt as to the taxation implications of the share proposal and, in particular, whether the receipt of the share offer price would make such scheme shareholders liable to taxation in hong kong or in other jurisdictions. 2.2 us federal income tax consequences this section describes the material us federal income tax consequences of the proposals. it applies to you only if you are a us holder, as defined below, and you hold your scheme shares as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the &#147; code &#148;), or you hold options received through compensation arrangements. this section does not address any tax considerations under state, local or foreign laws or us federal laws (e.g. estate or gift tax laws) other than those pertaining to us federal income tax. this section does not address all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to us holders in light of their particular circumstances. this section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including: &#149; a broker or dealer in securities or foreign currencies, &#149; a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities holdings, &#149; a non-us holder, &#149; a financial institution, &#149; a mutual fund, &#149; a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes, &#149; a tax-exempt organisation, &#149; a life insurance company, &#149; a person liable for alternative minimum tax, &#149; a person that actually or constructively owns 10 per cent or more of the voting stock of the company, &#149; a person that holds scheme shares as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, or &#149; a person whose functional currency is not the us dollar. this section is based on the code, its legislative history, existing and proposed us treasury regulations, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect. these laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. in addition, the company believes, and this summary assumes, that the company is not and never has been a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes. there can be no assurance that the us internal revenue service will not challenge one or more of the tax considerations described herein, and no ruling has been sought from the internal revenue service as to the us federal income tax consequences of the proposals. you are a us holder if you are a beneficial owner of scheme shares or options and you are: &#149; a citizen or resident of the united states, &#149; a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes, created or organised in or under the laws of the united states, any state within the united states, or the district of columbia, &#149; an estate whose income is subject to us federal income tax regardless of its source, or 66 part vii &#150; us special factors &#149; a trust if (i) a us court can exercise primary supervision over the trust&#146;s administration and one or more us persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable us treasury regulations to be treated as a us person. if a partnership or other flow-through entity holds scheme shares or options, the us federal income tax treatment of a partner or other owner generally will depend on the status of the partner or other owner and the activities of the partnership or other flow-through entity. it is recommended that a us holder that is a partner of a partnership or an owner of another flow-through entity holding scheme shares or options consult its own tax adviser. it is recommended that you consult your own tax adviser regarding the us federal, state and local other tax consequences of the proposals in your particular circumstances. 2.2.1 tax consequences of the share proposal if you are a us holder of scheme shares you will recognise capital gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the total consideration you receive for your scheme shares and your adjusted tax basis, determined in us dollars, in your scheme shares. capital gain of a non-corporate us holder is generally taxed at a maximum rate of 15 per cent where the property is held more than one year. the deductibility of a capital loss is subject to certain limitations under the code. the gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the united states for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. 2.2.2 tax consequences of the option proposal a us holder of options received through compensation arrangements that is an individual who receives cash in cancellation of such options will generally recognise, as ordinary income for us federal income tax purposes and potentially subject to withholding and information reporting, the cash payment received. if the optionholder is an employee, or received the options as an employee, the cash payments received by such holder will constitute wage income and will be subject to income and employment taxes. if the optionholder is a non-employee, the cash payment will be self-employment income. 2.2.3 foreign currency considerations a us holder&#146;s receipt of cash with respect to scheme shares or options that are paid in foreign currency will be included in the gross income of a us holder as translated into us dollars calculated by reference to the exchange rate prevailing on the date of receipt of such amount, regardless of whether the foreign currency is converted into us dollars at that time. if the foreign currency received is converted into us dollars on the date of receipt, a us holder generally should not be required to recognise foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the amount. if the foreign currency received is not converted into us dollars on the date of receipt, a us holder will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its us dollar value on the date of receipt. any us holder who receives payment in foreign currency and engages in a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the foreign currency may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss that would be treated as ordinary income or loss, and generally will be us source income or loss for foreign tax credit purposes. us holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers concerning the us tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of foreign currency. 2.2.4 backup withholding and information reporting if you are a non-corporate us holder, information reporting requirements, on internal revenue service form 1099, generally will apply to the payment of the consideration to you from the cancellation of your scheme shares or options effected at a us office of a broker. additionally, backup withholding may apply to such payments if you are a non-corporate us holder that: &#149; fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number, &#149; is notified by the us internal revenue service that you have failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on your us federal income tax returns, or &#149; in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements. 67 part vii &#150; us special factors backup withholding is not an additional tax, and you generally may obtain a refund or credit of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability, provided that you have furnished the required information to the us internal revenue service in a timely manner. tax matters are very complex, and the tax consequences of the scheme to you will depend on the facts of your own situation. it is recommended that you should consult your tax adviser for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the scheme to you. 3. management &#150; intentions and plans citic group and gecc intend to retain the company&#146;s existing senior management team to manage the company after completion of the proposals. as of the date of this scheme document, no member of the company&#146;s management team has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with the offeror or its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the company. in addition, as of the date of this scheme document, no member of the board has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with the offeror or its affiliates regarding any position on the board, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the company. provided the executive&#146;s consent under rule 7 of the takeovers code is obtained, mr. romain bausch, ms. cynthia dickins and mr. mark rigolle, the ses&#146;s appointees to the board, will resign from the board on completion of the exchange transaction and the ge entities will appoint new directors to the board to replace the ses appointees. it is anticipated that such new directors will be mr. ronald j. herman, jr., ms. nancy ku, mr. mark chen (each of whom is also a director of the offeror) and, so long as the company remains public, an additional person still to be determined by the ge entities. these changes to the board are in no way dependent on whether or not the proposals complete. no determination has yet been made as to whether, and if so, how, the composition of the board may be changed upon completion of the proposals. 4. where you can find more information asiasat files annual and other reports and submits other information with the sec. the sec maintains an internet web site that contains reports and other material that are filed through the sec&#146;s electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval (edgar) system. this system can be accessed at http://www.sec.gov . information filed by asiasat with the sec can be found by reference to asiasat&#146;s corporate name or to its sec file number, 1-14396. you may also read and copy any document filed by asiasat at the sec&#146;s public reference room located at: 100 f street, n.e., room 1580 washington, d.c. 20549 united states please call the sec at 1-800-sec-0330 (within the united states) or +1 202 551 8090 (outside the united states) for further information on the public reference room and its copy charges. because the privatisation is a &#147;going private&#148;

explanatory statement this explanatory statement constitutes the statement required under section 100 of the companies act. scheme of arrangement for the cancellation of the scheme shares, the creation, allotment and issue of the new asiasat shares and the payment of the share offer price and option offer price 1. introduction on 13 february 2007, the offeror requested the board to put forward the share proposal (detailed below) to the scheme shareholders for cancellation of the scheme shares to effect the privatisation of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 99 of the companies act and informed the board that it will make the option proposal (detailed below) to optionholders for the cancellation of outstanding options in exchange for cash. if approved, the scheme will be binding on all scheme shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the court meeting or the special general meeting. the effect of the proposals is that asiasat will become wholly owned by citic group and gecc, through bowenvale as to approximately 68.9 per cent and through the offeror as to approximately 31.1 per cent. the asiasat shares held by bowenvale will not form part of the scheme shares. 2. terms of the proposals the proposals are made on the following basis: the share proposal for each scheme share hk$ 18.30 in cash for each ads hk$ 183.00 in cash the option proposal for each outstanding b option hk$ 0.82 in cash for each outstanding c option hk$ 3.95 in cash the share offer price represents a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.00 per asiasat share as quoted on the stock exchange on the pre-suspension date, a premium of approximately 29.8 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.10 per asiasat share as quoted on the stock exchange on the suspension date and a premium of approximately 32.2 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price of hk$13.84 per asiasat share. the share offer price represents a discount of approximately 0.5 per cent to us$23.55 per ads as quoted on the nyse on the latest practicable date and a premium of approximately 14.4 per cent over the possible mgo share offer price. 2.1 the share proposal the aim of the share proposal is to privatise the company by way of the scheme and to cancel all the scheme shares (including scheme shares underlying the adss), which will result in a reduction of the issued share capital of the company under section 46 of the companies act, and to issue the new asiasat shares to the offeror. in consideration for the cancellation of the scheme shares, scheme shareholders will be entitled to receive the share offer price, being hk$18.30 per scheme share, in cash. as the adss are governed by the ads deposit agreement and not bermuda law, implementation of the scheme will not result in and of itself in cancellation of the adss. instead, upon the scheme becoming effective, the scheme shares underlying the adss will be cancelled along with all other scheme shares, and the cash received by the ads depositary (as registered owner of the scheme shares underlying the adss) upon cancellation of such scheme shares will be converted into us dollars by the ads depositary and distributed (less any fees and expenses of the ads depositary in connection with currency conversions under the ads deposit agreement and withholding taxes, if applicable) to the ads holders pro rata to their holdings upon exchange of their adss, in accordance with the provisions of the ads deposit agreement. no asiasat share acquired by the offeror pursuant to the share proposal will be transferred, charged or pledged to any other person, and there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings in place to do the same, nor are 70 part viii &#150; explanatory statement there any related charges or pledges which may result in the transfer of voting rights attached to asiasat shares, provided, however, that after the scheme becomes effective, the offeror may transfer its entire interest in asiasat to bowenvale. 2.2 the option proposal in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme, optionholders are entitled to exercise their options, which confer rights to subscribe for asiasat shares at a price of hk$17.48 per asiasat share in respect of b options and hk$14.35 per asiasat share in respect of c options, in full or in part at any time from the date of such notice until the earlier of (i) two calendar months after the date of the notice of the court meeting and, (ii) the date on which the scheme is sanctioned by the supreme court, but the exercise of the options as described above shall be conditional upon the scheme becoming effective. optionholders should note that under the rules of the share option scheme, in particular paragraph 8.5: (i) optionholders have the right to exercise options up to two calendar months after the date of despatch of the scheme document or the date of the sanction of the scheme by the supreme court, whichever is the earlier; (ii) optionholders who exercise their options prior to the voting record time will be scheme shareholders who may vote on the scheme, provided they are not concert parties of the offeror; and (iii) optionholders who exercise their options after the voting record time may do so until the scheme record time, but will only be able to do so subject to the terms of the scheme and conditional upon the scheme being sanctioned by the supreme court, and will therefore be bound by the scheme. asiasat shares issued upon exercise of the options in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme prior to the scheme record time will form part of the scheme shares. options which are not exercised in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme and to the extent in relation to which the option proposal is not accepted will lapse, subject to and conditional upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. the option proposal is conditional upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. under the option proposal, the offeror will offer to purchase outstanding options, for cancellation in exchange for hk$0.82 in cash for each outstanding b option, and hk$3.95 in cash for each outstanding c option subject to and conditional upon the scheme becoming effective and binding. further information on the option proposal has been set out in this scheme document and the option proposal will be made by or on behalf of the offeror in a letter to optionholders despatched on the same day as this scheme document. 2.3 total consideration on the basis of the share offer price of hk$18.30 per scheme share and 390,265,500 asiasat shares in issue, of which 121,360,500 were scheme shares as at the latest practicable date (including scheme shares underlying the adss), the scheme shares are valued at approximately hk$2,221 million. save for the options, there are no outstanding options, warrants, derivatives or other securities issued by asiasat that carried a right to subscribe for or which are convertible into asiasat shares. assuming none of the options are exercised prior to the scheme record time in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme and on the basis of the option offer price of hk$0.82 per outstanding b option, and hk$3.95 per outstanding c option, the option proposal is valued at approximately hk$14 million. assuming all options are exercised in full by the optionholders in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme prior to the scheme record time, no consideration will be payable under the option proposal, and the number of scheme shares will accordingly increase to 126,193,000 and the scheme shares would be valued at approximately hk$2,309 million. the total amount of cash required to effect the proposals is approximately hk$2,235 million if none of the options are exercised prior to the scheme record time. this amount would increase to an aggregate of approximately hk$2,309 million if all options are exercised prior to the scheme record time. 71 part viii &#150; explanatory statement the consideration to which any asiasat shareholder is entitled under the proposals will be implemented in full in accordance with the terms of the proposals without regard to any lien, right of set-off, counterclaim or other analogous right to which the offeror may otherwise be, or claim to be, entitled against such asiasat shareholder. 3. conditions of the proposals the share proposal will become effective and binding on the company and all scheme shareholders, subject to fulfilment or waiver (as applicable) of the following conditions: (a) the approval by way of poll of the scheme by a majority in number of the scheme shareholders representing not less than three-fourths in value of the scheme shares, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the court meeting, provided that: (i) the scheme is approved by at least 75 per cent of the votes attaching to scheme shares held by scheme shareholders that are cast either in person or by proxy at the court meeting;

(k) none of the telecommunications licences held by the group which are material in the context of the group as a whole having been revoked by ofta when conditions (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) are satisfied; (l) completion of the exchange transaction; and 72 part viii &#150; explanatory statement (m) since the date of this scheme document, no event having occurred in relation to any satellite whether under construction or in service and owned and/or operated by any member of the group (such as, without limitation, technical failure or launch failure, satellite defects, destruction and damage that may result in total or partial loss or incorrect orbital placement or prevent proper commercial operation) which has a material adverse effect on the business, assets, financial or trading position or prospects of the group taken as a whole. the offeror reserves the right to waive condition (g) either in whole or in part in respect of any particular matter. in the event that conditions (e) or (f) are not fulfilled by reason of an authorisation not having been obtained, the offeror reserves the right to assess the materiality of such non-fulfilment and to waive the fulfilment of such condition(s) to such extent where it considers appropriate. conditions (a) to (d), and conditions (j) and (l) cannot be waived in any event. the offeror may only invoke condition (m) as a basis for not proceeding with the scheme if the provisions of note 2 to rule 30.1 of the takeovers code are satisfied. note 2 to rule 30.1 of the takeovers code provides that an offeror should not invoke any condition (other than the acceptance condition) so as to cause the offer to lapse unless the circumstances which give rise to the right to invoke the condition are of material significance to the offeror in the context of the offer. the waiver or invoking by the offeror of any condition in accordance with the terms of this paragraph shall not be subject to the company&#146;s agreement, approval or consent. the offeror may not waive any other condition in any event, and the company has no right to waive any of the conditions. all of the above conditions will have to be fulfilled or waived, as applicable, on or before 30 june 2007 (or such later date as the offeror and the company may agree or (to the extent applicable) as the supreme court may direct and as may be permitted by the takeovers code), failing which the scheme will lapse. any extension to such later date shall not be beyond 31 october 2007. the offeror reserves the right to implement the privatisation of asiasat by way of a general offer. the implementation of the option proposal is conditional upon the share proposal becoming effective and binding. the offeror is not a party to any agreements or arrangements which relate to the circumstances in which it may or may not invoke or seek to invoke a condition to the share proposal and the option proposal. 4. background to, reasons for and benefits of the proposals 4.1 reasons for and benefits of the proposals due to the persistent oversupply of transponder capacity and the slow introduction of new applications in the region, the asia-pacific satellite market remains very competitive. as a result, the company&#146;s share price has not performed satisfactorily. in the three year period prior to the announcement date, the price of asiasat shares decreased by 11.9 per cent compared with an increase of 51.1 per cent in the hang seng index over the same period. given the overcapacity in the market, able star and ge equity believe that the unsatisfactory share performance of asiasat&#146;s shares may continue. asiasat&#146;s dividend yield remains relatively low as the company needs to preserve cash to endure competition in the market for commercial supply of satellite transponder capacity, to launch new satellites from time to time and to participate in potential acquisitions. therefore, the earnings of asiasat will continue to be under pressure in the short to medium term. for similar reasons, the offeror currently has no plans to increase the company&#146;s annual or interim dividend, cause the company to distribute any extraordinary dividend, or recapitalise the company&#146;s balance sheet by increasing the company&#146;s financial leverage in the ordinary course of business in the event the transfer completes and/or the scheme becomes effective. able star and ge equity propose to effect the privatisation through the scheme to enable asiasat to pursue development of its business with greater flexibility, and to effect the privatisation at a price in excess of the possible mgo share offer price in order to give minority shareholders a premium price for their asiasat shares. the scheme provides an opportunity for asiasat shareholders to exit and monetise their asiasat shares at a significant premium to the current market price. this price represents a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.00 per asiasat share on the pre-suspension date, a premium of approximately 29.8 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.10 per asiasat share on the suspension date, a premium of 73 part viii &#150; explanatory statement approximately 32.2 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price, and a premium of approximately 22.0 per cent over the highest closing price during the year prior to the announcement. the scheme also provides scheme shareholders with an opportunity to receive an offer price higher than the possible mgo share offer price. if the exchange transaction is completed but the scheme is unsuccessful, the possible mgo offers would be made and the scheme shareholders would have the choice of accepting the possible mgo share offer at a lower price per asiasat share than the share offer price. the privatisation would also, if it completes, relieve asiasat of the heavy financial and administrative burden of dual listings on both the stock exchange and the nyse. in particular, compliance costs of the us sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the maintenance costs of the listing on the nyse have, in recent years, resulted in substantial recurrent professional fees and time costs, which are disproportionate to the benefits of maintaining such listing. as a private company, asiasat management should have greater flexibility to focus on the development of business and marketing activities. this is particularly important given that asiasat is operating in a competitive market in which profitability is under pressure as a result of persistent overcapacity and the substantial investment required to construct and launch new satellites. as at the latest practicable date, bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it hold an aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued share capital of asiasat. if any third party were to make a competing offer for the privatisation of asiasat, such competing offer would not succeed without the acceptance by bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it. bowenvale and parties acting in concert with it have no intention to accept any competing offer. 4.2 effects of proposals 4.2.1 shareholder structure as at the latest practicable date, there were 390,265,500 asiasat shares in issue. the offeror currently neither owns nor has control or direction over any voting rights or rights over any asiasat shares; however, so far as the offeror is aware, the offeror and parties acting in concert with it are beneficially interested in 268,905,000 asiasat shares, representing approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued share capital of the company. the table below sets out the shareholding structure of the company as at the latest practicable date and immediately after the scheme becoming effective, completion of the option proposal and the listing of asiasat shares and the adss on the stock exchange and the nyse (respectively) is withdrawn and assuming (i) none of the options have been exercised on or prior to the scheme record time and (ii) all optionholders accept the option proposal: as at the latest practicable date immediately after the scheme becomes effective and the listing of asiasat shares on the stock exchange and adss on the nyse is withdrawn number of asiasat shares % number of asiasat shares % the offeror &#151;

explanatory statement date, parties acting in concert with the offeror held in aggregate 300,000 c options. to the extent that any of the 300,000 c options held by parties acting in concert with the offeror are exercised and converted into asiasat shares prior to the scheme record time, the asiasat shares will form part of the scheme shares, but may not be voted at the court meeting. the table below sets out details of the options as at the latest practicable date: optionholders number of options b options c options bowenvale directors mi zeng xin (also a director of the offeror) &#151; 100,000 ju wei min (also a director of the offeror) &#151; 50,000 ding yu cheng &#151; 50,000 romain bausch &#151; 100,000 other employees of the company, and directors of the company (other than those four directors named above) 1 1,630,000 2,902,500 total 1,630,000 3,202,500 1 the other directors of the company holding options being professor chen kwan yiu edward (50,000 c options), mr. sze tsai to robert (75,000 c options), mr. peter e. jackson (150,000 b options and 430,000 c options) and mr. william wade (114,000 b options and 330,000 c options), none of whom are acting in concert with the offeror, citic group or gec. save as disclosed above, there were no outstanding options, warrants, derivatives or other securities issued by the company that carried a right to subscribe for or which were convertible into asiasat shares and no other director of the company had any interest in asiasat shares, as at the latest practicable date. upon the scheme becoming effective, the company will be owned as to approximately 31.1 per cent by the offeror and as to approximately 68.9 per cent by bowenvale. 4.2.2 participation in asiasat upon the scheme becoming effective and binding, citic group and gecc will own indirectly 100 per cent of the issued share capital of the company. if the scheme is completed, the scheme shareholders will cease to have ownership interests in the company and rights as the company&#146;s shareholders, and, as a result, scheme shareholders will not participate in any future earnings, losses, growth or decline of the company. moreover, the company intends to have the adss de-listed from the nyse following completion of the scheme. as a result, public trading of the adss will cease. the company&#146;s net income was hk$453,405,000 for the year ended 31 december 2006 and the shareholders&#146; equity was hk$4,421,604,000 as of 31 december 2006. as of 31 december 2006, bowenvale was the holder of approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company. pursuant to the share proposal, each of the scheme shareholders (being holders of the approximately 31.1 per cent of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company), totalling 121,360,500 asiasat shares) will receive hk$18.30 in cash for each asiasat share it holds. if the transaction is consummated, citic group and gecc&#146;s indirect interest in the company&#146;s net income and in the company&#146;s shareholders&#146; equity will equal 100 per cent. after the transaction, citic group and gecc (through their respective affiliates) will be entitled to all benefits resulting from such interest, including all income generated by the company&#146;s operations and any future increase in the company&#146;s value. similarly, citic group and gecc (through their respective affiliates) will also bear all the risks of losses generated by the company&#146;s operations and any future decrease in the value of the company after the transaction. 4.2.3 market for asiasat securities the company will apply to the stock exchange for the withdrawal of the listing of the asiasat shares on the stock exchange pursuant to rule 6.15 of the listing rules as soon as practicable after the scheme becomes effective. scheme shareholders will be notified by way of a press announcement of the exact dates on which the scheme and the withdrawal of the listing of the asiasat shares on the stock exchange will become effective. 75 part viii &#150; explanatory statement upon the scheme becoming effective, all scheme shares will be cancelled and share certificates for the scheme shares will cease to have effect as documents of evidence of title and should be returned to the company for cancellation. upon the scheme becoming effective and the company becoming wholly indirectly owned by citic group and gecc through the offeror and bowenvale, the company will also apply for de-listing of the adss from the nyse. citic group and gecc also intend to seek to cause the company to terminate the ads deposit agreement. if the scheme becomes effective, citic group and gecc intend to cause the company to file a form 15 with the sec to request that the company&#146;s reporting obligations under the exchange act be terminated or suspended, provided the relevant rules and regulations under the exchange act are satisfied. irrespective of the outcome of the scheme, in due course, it is expected that the maintenance of the ads listing on the nyse will be re-examined by asiasat and the board, the outcome of which may be to terminate such listing. 5. intentions and plans 5.1 intentions regarding asiasat it is the intention of citic group and gecc to maintain the existing businesses of the asiasat group upon successful privatisation of the company. citic group and gecc do not intend to introduce any major changes to the existing operating and management structure of the asiasat group, or to discontinue the employment of any employees of the asiasat group, as a result of the implementation of the proposals. upon the successful implementation of the proposals and asiasat becoming a private company, asiasat will, however, no longer have access to equity funding through the public capital markets. citic group and gecc also expect that there will be no material change to the existing business (such as business focus and operating model) of the asiasat group as a result of the implementation of the proposals. upon the completion of the exchange transaction, the shareholders&#146; agreement will be terminated. citic group and the ge entities will execute a new shareholders agreement in respect of bowenvale, to become effective upon the completion of the exchange transaction, which will be substantially similar to the shareholders&#146; agreement. the new shareholders agreement will contain a provision prohibiting citic group or the ge entities from transferring any bowenvale shares for a period of three years following the completion of the exchange transaction. upon the successful privatisation of asiasat, able star and the ge entities may consider entering into a simpler shareholders&#146; agreement in respect of bowenvale to reflect asiasat&#146;s status as a private company, as opposed to a publicly listed company. citic group and ge equity entered into a shareholders agreement dated 13 february 2007 in respect of the offeror which becomes effective in all material respects with effect from the scheme becoming effective and binding. after the successful privatisation of the company, citic group and gecc contemplate that they will assess whether to revise asiasat&#146;s bye-laws to reflect its change from a public to a private company. 5.2 management citic group and gecc intend to retain the company&#146;s existing senior management team to manage the company after completion of the proposals, save that provided the executive&#146;s consent under rule 7 of the takeovers code is obtained, the ses appointees upon completion of the exchange transaction to the board, namely mr. roman bausch, ms. cynthia dickins and mr. mark rigolle will resign as directors, and the ge entities will appoint four directors to replace them (for so long as the company remains public). it is anticipated that the four directors to be appointed by the ge entities will be mr. ronald j. herman, jr., ms. nancy ku and mr. mark chen, each of whom is a ge equity appointed director of the offeror, and an additional person still to be determined by the ge entities. these changes to the board are in no way dependent on whether or not the proposals complete. rule 7 of the takeovers code provides that once a bona fide offer has been communicated to the board of the offeree company, except with the consent of the executive, the directors of an offeree company should not resign until the first closing date of the offer, or the date when the offer becomes or is declared unconditional, whichever is later. in the context of the proposals this means none of the directors should resign before the date of the court meeting. in the context of the possible mgo share offer this means none of the directors should resign before the first closing date of the possible mgo share offer (if the scheme fails). an application was made to the executive by ge equity and ses on 13 march 2007 to obtain consent in respect of rule 7, however it is uncertain as to whether such consent will be granted. no determination has yet been made as to whether, and if so, how, the composition of the board may be changed upon completion of the proposals. 76 part viii &#150; explanatory statement 6. source and amount of funds the offeror expects that the total amount of cash required to effect the proposals is approximately hk$2,235 million if none of the outstanding options is exercised prior to the scheme record time. this amount would increase to an aggregate of approximately hk$2,309 million if all outstanding options are exercised prior to the scheme record time. the proposals will be financed from the existing resources of citic group and gecc. the offeror&#146;s financial adviser, morgan stanley, is satisfied that sufficient financial resources are and will be available to the offeror for the implementation in full of the proposals. the offeror will not increase any of the offer prices. each of the share offer price, the option offer price, the possible mgo share offer price and the possible mgo option offer price represents the best and final offer price in respect of the share proposal, the option proposal, the possible mgo share offer and the possible mgo option offer, respectively. asiasat shareholders should be aware that, following the making of these statements in the announcement, the offeror is not allowed to increase any of the offer prices, save in wholly exceptional circumstances, as provided in rule 18.3 of the takeovers code. notwithstanding the above, the offeror reserves the right not to be bound by these statements in the event of a competing offer and such competing offer is recommended by the board. 7. comparisons of value 7.1 comparables the stock exchange is the principal trading market for the asiasat shares, which are not listed on any other exchange in or outside of the united states. the high and low closing prices for the asiasat shares on the stock exchange for each full quarterly period during the past two years are as follows: high low 2005 first quarter hk$ 15.00 hk$ 14.20 second quarter hk$ 15.10 hk$ 13.50 third quarter hk$ 15.95 hk$ 13.60 fourth quarter hk$ 14.90 hk$ 12.95 2006 first quarter hk$ 14.85 hk$ 12.20 second quarter hk$ 14.00 hk$ 13.00 third quarter hk$ 13.30 hk$ 12.28 fourth quarter hk$ 15.00 hk$ 12.90 the share offer price represents: &#149;

&#149; a premium of approximately 32.2 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price of hk$13.84 per asiasat share; &#149; a premium of approximately 4.3 per cent over the closing price of hk$17.54 per asiasat share as quoted on the stock exchange on the latest practicable date; &#149; a premium of approximately 1.4 per cent over the highest closing price of approximately hk$18.04 per asiasat share over the one year period prior to the latest practicable date; &#149; an implied price to earnings multiple of 19.5 times, based on asiasat&#146;s reported basic earnings per share of hk$0.94 for the year ended 31 december 2005; &#149; an implied price to earnings multiple of 15.8 times, based on asiasat&#146;s reported basic earnings per share of hk$1.16 for the year ended 31 december 2006; 77 part viii &#150; explanatory statement &#149; a premium of approximately 74.0 per cent to the audited consolidated net asset value per asiasat share of approximately hk$10.52 as at 31 december 2005; &#149; a premium of approximately 61.5 per cent to the audited consolidated net asset value per asiasat share of approximately hk$11.33 as at 31 december 2006; and &#149; a premium of approximately 14.4 per cent over the possible mgo share offer price. the nyse is the principal trading market for the adss, which are not listed on any other exchange in or outside of the united states. at the exchange rate in effect on the latest practicable date, the share offer price of hk$18.30, which translates into a price of hk$183.00 per ads, would be equal to us$23.43. the high and low closing prices for the adss on the nyse for each full quarterly period during the past two years are as follows: high low 2005 first quarter us$ 19.07 us$ 18.27 second quarter us$ 19.08 us$ 17.11 third quarter us$ 20.45 us$ 17.61 fourth quarter us$ 19.02 us$ 16.55 2006 first quarter us$ 19.40 us$ 16.15 second quarter us$ 18.35 us$ 16.65 third quarter us$ 17.19 us$ 16.05 fourth quarter us$ 18.85 us$ 16.21 the share offer price represents: &#149; a premium of approximately 32.0 per cent over the closing price of us$17.75 per ads as quoted on the nyse on the pre-suspension date; &#149; a premium of approximately 30.7 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement ads price of us$17.93 per ads; &#149; a discount of approximately 0.5 per cent to the closing price of us$23.55 per ads as quoted on the nyse on the latest practicable date; and &#149; a discount of approximately 0.5 per cent to the highest closing price of approximately us$23.55 per ads over the one year period prior to the latest practicable date. 7.2 net tangible assets as at 31 december 2006, the audited consolidated net assets of the group amounted to approximately hk$4.422 million, or approximately hk$11.33 per asiasat share. the share offer price represents a premium of approximately 62 per cent to the audited consolidated net asset value per share as at 31 december 2006. 7.3 earnings the group&#146;s audited consolidated profit attributable to the asiasat shareholders for the year ended 31 december 2006 amounted to approximately hk$454 million, representing basic and diluted earnings of approximately hk$1.16 and hk$1.16 per asiasat share, respectively. 78 part viii &#150; explanatory statement 7.4 dividends the following table shows the amount of dividends per asiasat share paid in the past two years: payment date dividends paid per asiasat share hk$ 14 november 2006 (interim dividend) 0.08 23 may 2006 (final dividend) 0.27 15 november 2005 (interim dividend) 0.08 18 may 2005 (final dividend) 0.27 a dividend declared by the company after 13 february 2007 (the date of the announcement) and prior to the scheme becoming effective will be declared subject to the following: (i) the amount of the dividend shall not affect the share offer price if the scheme becomes effective and binding on or before 10 may 2007; (ii) the amount of the dividend will be deducted from the share offer price if the scheme becomes effective and binding after 10 may 2007; (iii) if the scheme becomes effective and binding on or before 10 may 2007, the dividend shall not be paid; and (iv) if the scheme does not become effective, the dividend will be paid to asiasat shareholders on the register of members of the company at 4:30 p.m. on 10 may 2007. asiasat has been designated as a non-resident for exchange control purposes by the bermuda monetary authority. consequently, there are no restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, other than in respect of local bermuda currency. 8. cash payment to citic group in consideration of citic group&#146;s consent to the transfer and in exchange for the release of the ses parties from their obligations and liabilities under the shareholders&#146; agreement citic group will receive a cash payment of hk$100 million from ses and/or its subsidiaries and ses&#146;s continuation of certain of its obligations under the shareholders&#146; agreement, in modified form, under a new arrangement. the cash payment will be made directly by ses (or the relevant subsidiary) to citic group upon completion of the exchange transaction. 9. the exchange transaction bowenvale, asiasat&#146;s largest shareholder, is a joint venture indirectly and jointly owned by citic group (through able star) and ses. bowenvale has three classes of share capital &#150; &#147;x ordinary shares&#148; (representing 49.5 per cent of its share capital), &#147;y ordinary shares&#148; (representing 49.5 per cent of its share capital) and &#147;special shares&#148; (representing 1 per cent of its share capital). currently, citic group is the beneficial owner of the x ordinary shares and ses (prior to the closing of the exchange transaction) is the beneficial owner of the y ordinary shares. the x and y ordinary shares have full and equal rights to vote, receive dividends and receive capital upon the winding up of bowenvale. citic group is also the beneficial owner of the special shares, which have no voting rights. bowenvale currently holds approximately 68.9 per cent of asiasat&#146;s entire issued share capital. pursuant to the exchange transaction, ses proposes to redeem gecc&#146;s entire indirect shareholding in ses (approximately 19 per cent of ses&#146; issued share capital) in exchange for the stock of a newly incorporated company, sih, that will hold cash and a number of assets, among which are the y ordinary shares that ses will transfer to sih. the transfer represents an integral part of the exchange transaction. the exchange transaction is structured as a package deal in order to achieve the business purposes of ses without negative us tax consequences for gecc. upon completion of the exchange transaction, able star and the ge entities will jointly own, through bowenvale, approximately 68.9 per cent of the asiasat shares. the exchange transaction was publicly announced on 13 february 2007. on completion of the exchange transaction, gecc will obtain a 49.5 per cent economic interest and 50 per cent voting interest in bowenvale and, as a result, an approximately 34.1 per cent indirect economic interest in asiasat. 79 part viii &#150; explanatory statement the executive has taken the view that the transfer would, on completion, result in the formation of a new concert group that has statutory control of bowenvale, thereby triggering a mandatory general offer obligation under the takeovers code in respect of asiasat. whilst the view taken by able star and ge equity is different from that of the executive, the offeror agreed that it would be prepared, in the event the transfer completes, to make a mandatory general offer for all the shares in the company not owned by bowenvale or parties acting in concert with it. if the possible mgo share offer is made, it would be at the possible mgo share offer price. the executive also raised a concern that the exchange transaction, when considered in conjunction with a general offer for the company, could potentially give rise to a special deal prohibited under rule 25 of the takeovers code, if certain elements of the exchange transaction, other than the transfer, represent favourable conditions that are not extended to all shareholders of the company. each of gecc and ses had separate discussions with the executive to clarify the relevant aspects and background of the exchange transaction, including the reasons why it was structured as a package deal and why the bowenvale shares were included. ses has indicated that its business purposes for engaging in the exchange transaction are (i) to remove the &#147;overhang&#148; effect on the trading market for its shares so as to meaningfully facilitate its acquisition strategy; and (ii) to restructure and optimise its newly acquired business assets and its portfolio of shareholdings in satellite system owners and operators and to refocus its satellite service activities to match its intended market positioning, in a single transaction. the exchange transaction was structured to achieve these business purposes in a manner that is tax-efficient for gecc. the completion of the exchange transaction is subject to certain conditions, including, among others: (a) conditions to the obligations of ses, gecc and the gecc parties under the share redemption agreement: (i) ses shareholder approval, which approval has been obtained; (ii) regulatory approvals, including: &#149; the expiration or termination of any waiting period pursuant to the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, which waiting period has been terminated; &#149; the issue of orders by the us federal communications commission; &#149; the approval of the austrian and german merger control authorities, or the expiration of any relevant review period, which approval from the german merger control authority has been obtained; &#149; the approval of the japanese telecom authority required in respect of the exchange transaction; &#149; the issue by the us department of state of any approvals which may be required pursuant to the us international traffic in arms regulations in respect of the exchange transaction and the proposals and the possible mgo offers; &#149; the issue, by ofta, of a formal consent or other instrument acceptable to the sfc as necessary for the purposes of a waiver of compliance with note 4 of rule 26.2 of the takeovers code; &#149; receipt of a waiver of condition 10.1 of the broadcasting licences held by skywave tv company and auspicious color limited from the hong kong broadcasting authority; &#149; except in certain circumstances, the approval of the agencia nacional de telcomunicacoes of brazil;

in its letter, which should be read in the context of the full text of that letter), considers that the terms of the share proposal and the option proposal are fair and reasonable so far as the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) and optionholders are respectively concerned. accordingly, the independent board committee has recommended that the scheme shareholders (including without limitation the ads holders) to vote or procure to vote in favour of both the resolution to approve the scheme at the court meeting and the special resolution to approve, among other matters, the capital reduction arising as a result of the scheme at the special general meeting, and that the optionholders accept the option offer. the full text of the letter from the independent board committee is set out in part vi of this scheme document. 23. independent advice asiasat shareholders, ads holders and optionholders are recommended to consult their own professional advisers if they are in any doubt as to the taxation or other implications of the scheme becoming effective or otherwise. it is emphasised that none of the company, the offeror, clsa or morgan stanley or any of their respective directors or any other person involved in the proposals accepts responsibility for any tax or other effects on, or liabilities of, any person or persons as a result of the implementation or otherwise of the proposals. 24. further information further information is set out in the other parts of this scheme document, all of which form part of this explanatory statement. us holders are also directed to &#147;part vii &#150; us special factors&#148; which includes a section entitled &#147;where you can find more information&#148;. 101 part ix &#150; the possible mgo offers gecc and ses have agreed to pursue the exchange transaction, which involves the redemption by ses of gecc&#146;s entire indirect shareholding (of approximately 19 per cent) in ses in exchange for stock of a newly incorporated company that will own a number of assets. among these assets is ses&#146;s entire interest in bowenvale which ses will transfer to such newly incorporated company. bowenvale holds approximately 68.9 per cent of the issued ordinary shares of the company. the executive has taken the view that the acquisition by the ge entities of ses&#146;s entire shareholding in bowenvale pursuant to the exchange transaction would, on completion, result in the formation of a new concert group which has statutory control of bowenvale, thereby triggering a mandatory general offer obligation under the takeovers code. whilst the view taken by able star and ge equity is different from that of the executive, the offeror agreed that it would be prepared, in the event the transfer proceeds to completion, to make a mandatory general offer for all the shares in the company not owned by bowenvale or parties acting in concert with it. accordingly, the possible mgo offers were announced simultaneously with the announcement of the proposals. if the possible mgo share offer were to be made, it would be made at the possible mgo share offer price, payable in cash. the possible mgo share offer price is hk$16.00, compared to the share offer price of hk$18.30. the possible mgo share offer, if and when made, will not be subject to any condition. it is envisaged that where the transfer completes and all the other conditions to the proposals are either satisfied or waived, the scheme will become effective and all scheme shares will be acquired by the offeror at the share offer price, which will be hk$18.30, being approximately 14.4 per cent higher than the possible mgo share offer price. in such circumstance, the substance of the obligations that would arise under the possible mgo offers will have been satisfied and it would therefore be redundant to despatch the formal mgo documentation and to commence the offer in respect of the possible mgo offers. in the event the transfer completes prior to the meetings an announcement will be made of the satisfaction of that condition. it is intended that the formal offer documentation in respect of the possible mgo offers would not be posted until after the meetings are held. if the requisite voting thresholds are obtained at the meetings, the formal offer documentation in respect of the possible mgo offers will not be despatched and the possible mgo offers will not commence. if the requisite voting thresholds are not obtained at the meetings, the formal mgo documentation will be posted. an application under rule 8.2 of the takeovers code has been made by the offeror to extend the posting date in respect of the formal mgo documentation and the executive has agreed to extend this period to 2 may 2007. if the exchange transaction is not completed by this date the offeror and the company will make a further rule 8.2 application to the executive for a further extension to the despatch date but there is no guarantee that the further extension will be granted. for the avoidance of doubt, the formal mgo documentation will not be despatched, if at all, until after the meetings have been held. in the event that the transfer completes but the scheme is unsuccessful, the possible mgo share offer document, possible mgo option offer letter and forms of acceptance in respect of the possible mgo offers would be despatched to asiasat shareholders and optionholders, respectively, following the failure or lapsing of the scheme. if scheme shareholders vote in favour of the scheme, the supreme court sanctions the scheme and the order of the supreme court sanctioning the scheme is delivered to the registrar of companies in bermuda for registration, the scheme will be binding on all scheme shareholders, including those that may not have voted in favour of the scheme. in this event, there will not be a choice for the offeror to pay the mgo share offer price, and the share offer price, which is higher than the mgo share offer price, will have to be paid. if the possible mgo offers are required to be made, they would be made in compliance with the applicable requirements of the exchange act, as well as in accordance with the terms of any relief from the sec obtained in connection with the proposals and the possible mgo offers. ofta investigation pursuant to rule 26.2(a) of the takeovers code, except with the consent of the executive, offers made under rule 26 of the takeovers code must be conditional only upon the offeror having received acceptances in respect 102 part ix &#150; the possible mgo offers of voting rights which will result in the offeror and any person acting in concert with it holding more than 50 per cent. of the voting rights. further, pursuant to note 4 of rule 26.2, an offeror must not trigger a mandatory offer of the shares in a telecommunications carrier licensee without obtaining ofta&#146;s consent under section 7(p) of the telecommunications ordinance. gecc and citic group have jointly sought informal advice from ofta as to whether it will provide such consent under section 7(p) of the telecommunications ordinance. ofta has indicated that it would not, having considered whether there are any anti-competitive effects arising from the proposals, embark on a public consultation process under section 7(p) of the telecommunications ordinance. where completion of the transfer occurs prior to or simultaneously with the meetings pursuant to section 7(p) of the telecommunications ordinance, ofta may initiate an investigation into the anti-competitive effects of any transaction within a period of two weeks from the time ofta knows or ought reasonably to know that a relevant change (as defined in section 7(p)(16) of the telecommunications ordinance, being the completion of the transfer) has occurred. ofta has further indicated that it would, as soon as practicable following the receipt of a notice from ge equity that the relevant change has occurred (the &#147; notice &#148;), notify ge equity whether or not it would initiate any such investigation. it is intended that as soon as practicable after the completion of the transfer, ge equity will give notice to ofta (copied to citic group). it is envisaged that by the time the formal mgo documentation is expected to be despatched, it will become clear whether ofta will initiate an investigation under section 7(p) of the telecommunications ordinance. where the voting thresholds in respect of the scheme at the meetings are met in the event that the transfer completes prior to or simultaneously with the meetings and the requisite voting thresholds to privatise the company are obtained at the meetings, the formal mgo documentation will not be despatched. where the voting thresholds in respect of the scheme at the meetings are not met as mentioned above, completion of the transfer would be a relevant change for the purposes of section 7(p)(16) of the telecommunications ordinance. in the event that the transfer completes prior to or simultaneous with the meetings, but the scheme is unsuccessful, it is envisaged that by the time the formal mgo documentation is expected to be despatched it will become clear whether ofta will initiate an investigation under section 7(p) of the telecommunications ordinance. the possible mgo offers the possible mgo offers, if and when made, will be made on the following basis: for each possible mgo share hk$ 16.00 in cash for each ads hk$ 160.00 in cash for each b option hk$ 0.01 in cash for each c option hk$ 1.65 in cash comparison of value the possible mgo share offer price represents: &#149;

&#149; a premium of approximately 13.5 per cent over the closing price of hk$14.10 per asiasat share as quoted on the stock exchange on the suspension date; 103 part ix &#150; the possible mgo offers &#149; a premium of approximately 15.6 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement price of hk$13.84 per asiasat share, respectively; &#149; a premium of approximately 14.3 per cent over the 30-day average pre-announcement ads price of us$17.93 per ads; &#149; a discount of approximately 11.3 per cent to the highest closing price of approximately hk$18.04 per asiasat share over the one-year period prior to the latest practicable date; &#149; a discount of approximately 13.0 per cent to the highest closing price of approximately us$23.55 per ads over the one-year period prior to the latest practicable date; &#149; a discount of approximately 13.0 per cent to us$23.55 per ads as quoted on the nyse on the latest practicable date; &#149; an implied price to earnings multiple of 17.0 times, based on asiasat&#146;s reported basic earnings per share of hk$0.94 for the year ended 31 december 2005; &#149; an implied price to earnings multiple of 13.8 times, based on asiasat&#146;s reported basic earnings per share of hk$1.16 for the year ended 31 december 2006; &#149; a premium of approximately 52.1 per cent to the audited consolidated net asset value per asiasat share of approximately hk$10.52 as at 31 december 2005; and &#149; a premium of approximately 41.2 per cent to the audited consolidated net asset value per asiasat share of approximately hk$11.33 as at 31 december 2006 the possible mgo option offer in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme, optionholders are entitled to exercise their options, which confer rights to subscribe for asiasat shares at a price hk$17.48 per share in respect of b options and hk$14.35 per share in respect of c options, in full or in part at any time within 21 days of despatch of the formal mgo documentation (or such later date as the directors may determine). asiasat shares issued upon exercise of the options in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme will form part of the possible mgo shares. if the possible mgo option offer is not accepted within the relevant time period and in relation to which the options are not exercised in accordance with the rules of the share option scheme, such options will lapse. under the possible mgo option offer, the offeror will offer to purchase options for cancellation in exchange for hk$0.01 in cash for each b option and hk$1.65 in cash for each outstanding c option. further information on the possible mgo options offer will be set out in the formal offer document to be issued in respect of the possible mgo share offer (if and when made) and the possible mgo option offer will be made by or on behalf of the offeror in a letter to optionholders to be despatched on the same day as such formal offer document. the attention of the optionholders is drawn to the rules of the share option scheme, and in particular paragraph 8.4 of the rules of the share option scheme. total consideration on the basis of the possible mgo share offer price of hk$16.00 per possible mgo share and 390,265,500 asiasat shares being in issue at the time the possible mgo share offer is made (if made) and assuming there is no change to the issued share capital of asiasat as compared to the latest practicable date and the closing of the possible mgo offers, the possible mgo shares are valued at approximately hk$1,942 million. save for the options, there are no outstanding options, warrants, derivatives or other securities issued by asiasat that carried a right to subscribe for or which are convertible into asiasat shares. assuming none of the options is exercised prior to the closing of the possible mgo offers in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme and on the basis of the possible mgo option offer price of hk$0.01 per b option and hk$1.65 per c option, the possible mgo option offer is valued at approximately hk$5 million. assuming all options are exercised in full by the optionholders in accordance with the terms of the share option scheme prior to the closing of the possible mgo offers, no consideration will be payable under the possible mgo option offer, and the number of possible mgo shares will increase accordingly. 104 part ix &#150; the possible mgo offers the total amount of cash required to effect the possible mgo offers is approximately hk$1,947 million if none of the options is exercised prior to the closing of the possible mgo offers. this amount would increase to an aggregate of approximately hk$2,019 million if all options are exercised prior to the closing of the possible mgo offers. confirmation of financial resources the possible mgo and the possible mgo option offer will be financed from the existing resources of citic group and gecc. the offeror&#146;s financial adviser, morgan stanley, is satisfied that sufficient financial resources are and will be available to the offeror for the implementation of the possible mgo share offer and the possible mgo option offer. effect of accepting the possible mgo offer by accepting the possible mgo offer, asiasat shareholders would be required to sell to the offeror asiasat shares free from all rights of pre-emption, options, claims, equities, liens, charges, encumbrances and any third party rights or interests of any nature whatsoever and together with all rights, benefits and entitlements attaching to them, including the right to receive all dividends, rights and distributions declared, paid or made on or after the date of closing of the possible mgo share offer. if any dividend is declared by the company after 13 february 2007 and prior to the closing of the possible mgo share offer, the amount of such dividend will be retained by asiasat shareholders and deducted from the possible mgo share offer price to be received by asiasat shareholders who have accepted the possible mgo offer. public float and compulsory acquisition asiasat shareholders should be aware that, in the event the asiasat shares held by the public represent less than 25 per cent of the issued asiasat shares, trading in the asiasat shares may be suspended. it should be noted that if the possible mgo offers are made and close, there may be an insufficient level of public float in asiasat shares and therefore, trading in asiasat shares may be suspended until the prescribed level of public float is attained. if the possible mgo share offer is made and sufficient acceptances of the possible mgo share offer are received, it is the intention of the offeror to make use of the compulsory acquisition provisions of the companies act. in the event the compulsory acquisition thresholds are attained, subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of the takeovers code and the listing rules, the listing of asiasat shares will be withdrawn from the stock exchange and the offeror intends to cause the company to apply for de-listing of the adss from the nyse. rule 2.11 of the takeovers code states that, except with the consent of the executive, where any person seeks to acquire or privatise a company by means of an offer and the use of compulsory acquisition rights, such rights may only be exercised if, in addition to satisfying any requirements imposed by law, acceptances of the offer and purchases, in each case of the disinterested shares, made by the offeror and persons acting in concert with it during the period of four months after the posting of the initial offer document total 90 per cent of the disinterested shares. 105 part ix &#150;

(a) subsidiaries subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity. subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. they are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. the purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 113 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the group&#146;s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group. in the company&#146;s balance sheet the investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment losses. the results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the company on the basis of dividends received and receivable. (b) associates associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights. investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. the group&#146;s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition. the group&#146;s share of its associates&#146; post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. the cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. when the group&#146;s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the group&#146;s interest in the associates. unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group. in the company&#146;s balance sheet the investments in associated companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment losses. the results of associated companies are accounted for by the company on the basis of dividends received and receivable. 2.3 segment reporting a business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. a geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments. 2.4 foreign currency translation (a) functional and presentation currency items included in the financial statements of each of the group&#146;s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (&#145;the functional currency&#146;). the consolidated financial statements are presented in hong kong dollars, which is the company&#146;s functional and presentation currency. (b) transactions and balances foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. 114 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equity instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. translation difference on non-monetary items, such as equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets, are included in the fair value reserve in equity. (c) group companies the results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: (i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; (ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and (iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. 2.5 property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. buildings in the course of development for production, rental or administrative purposes or for purposes not yet determined, are carried at cost, less any identified impairment loss. depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. subsequent costs are included in the asset&#146;s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. all other repairs and maintenance are expensed in the income statement during the financial year in which they are incurred. depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, at the following rates per annum: satellites: &#150; asiasat 2 8% &#150; asiasat 3s 6.25% &#150; asiasat 4 6.67% buildings 4% tracking facilities 10%-20% furniture, fixtures and fittings 20%-33% other equipment 25%-33% motor vehicles 25% plant and machinery 20% the assets&#146; residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. an asset&#146;s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset&#146;s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. these are included in the income statement. when revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings. 115 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 2.6 intangible assets &#150; licences the licences are shown at historical cost. one licence has a finite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the licence over its estimated useful life (112 months). the other licence does not have a finite useful life. 2.7 impairment of assets assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation, are tested at least annually for impairment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset&#146;s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset&#146;s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. for the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 2.8 goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an investment over the fair value of the group&#146;s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired associates at the date of investment. goodwill on investment of associates is included in interests in associates. goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 2.9 inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (fifo) method and comprises all costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present locations and conditions. net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. 2.10 trade and other receivables trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment. a provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 180 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. the amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement within administrative expenses. 2.11 cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 2.12 share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity. incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 116 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 2.13 borrowings borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial asset or financial liability, including fees and commissions paid to agents, advisers, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and transfer taxes and duties. borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 2.14 deferred income tax deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. however, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 2.15 employee benefits (a) pension obligations the group participates in defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. the pension plans are generally funded by payments from employees and by the relevant group companies. the group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. the contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due and are reduced by contributions forfeited by those employees who leave the scheme prior to vesting fully in the contributions. prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. (b) share-based compensation the group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. at each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. it recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. (c) profit-sharing and bonus plans the expected cost of profit sharing and bonus payments are recognised as a liability when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of services rendered by employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. liabilities for profit sharing and bonus plans are expected to be settled within 12 months and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when they are settled. 117 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 2.16 provisions provisions for environmental restoration, asset retirement obligations, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when: the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. a provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. 2.17 revenue recognition revenue from transponder utilisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements. the excess of revenue recognised on a straight-line basis over the amount received and receivable from customers in accordance with the contract terms is shown as unbilled receivable. revenue from the sale of transponder capacity under transponder purchase agreements is recognised on a straight-line basis from the date of delivery of the transponder capacity until the end of the estimated useful life of the satellite. deposits received in advance in connection with the provision of transponder capacity are deferred and included in other payables. services under transponder utilisation agreements are generally billed quarterly in advance. such amounts received in advance and amounts received from the sale of transponder capacity under transponder purchase agreements in excess of amounts recognised as revenue are recorded as deferred revenue. deferred revenue which will be recognised in the following year is classified under current liabilities and amounts which will be recognised after one year are classified as non-current. interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal amounts outstanding and at the interest rate applicable. 2.18 operating leases (as the lessee) leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 2.19 dividend distribution dividend distribution to the company&#146;s equity holders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company&#146;s equity holders. 3. financial risk management 3.1 financial risk factors the group&#146;s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: foreign exchange risk, credit risk and cash flow interest-rate risk. the group&#146;s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the group&#146;s financial performance. (a) foreign exchange risk during the year, almost all of the group&#146;s revenues, premiums for satellite insurance coverage and substantially all capital expenditure were denominated in us dollars. the group&#146;s remaining expenses were primarily denominated in hong kong dollars. at 31 december 2006, almost all the group&#146;s transponder utilisation agreements, transponder purchase agreement, loan agreements, obligations to 118 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 3. financial risk management (continued) purchase telemetry, tracking and control equipment were denominated in us dollars. hence, the group does not have any significant currency exposure and does not need to hedge. (b) credit risk the group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. the group maintains provision for impairment of receivables and for estimated losses that result from the inability of its customers to make the required payments. the group bases its provision on the likelihood of recoverability of account receivables based on past experience and current collection trends that are expected to continue. the group&#146;s evaluation also includes the length of time the receivables are past due and the general business environment. (c) cash flow interest-rate risk the group has no significant interest-bearing assets or liabilities, however, the group earns interest income from short term deposits which are affected by the changes in market interest rates. 4. critical accounting estimates and judgments estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 4.1 critical accounting estimates and assumptions the group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. (a) estimated impairment of goodwill the group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.8. the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. these calculations require the use of estimates. (b) income taxes the group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. the issue of indian tax is covered under contingencies in note 28 below. (c) useful lives of in-orbit satellites the group&#146;s operations are capital intensive and it has significant investments in satellites. the carrying value of the group&#146;s in-orbit satellites (asiasat 2, asiasat 3s and asiasat 4) represented 42% of its total assets as of 31 december 2006 (2005: 52%). the group estimates the useful lives of satellites in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during the reported period. the useful lives are estimated at the time satellites are put into orbit and are based on historical experience with other satellites as well as the anticipated technological evolution or other environmental changes. if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these satellites may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation in a future period. similarly, if the actual lives of satellites are longer than the group has estimated, the group would have a smaller depreciation expense. as a result, if the group&#146;s estimations of the useful lives of its satellites are not accurate or are required to be changed in the future, the group&#146;s net income in future periods would be affected. 119 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 4. critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) (d) realisability of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets the group is required to evaluate at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets (primarily its satellites) may be impaired. if any such indication exists, the group should estimate the recoverable amount of the long-lived assets. an impairment loss is recognised for the excess of the carrying amount of such long-lived assets over their recoverable amounts. the value in use is the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of long-lived assets and cash arising from its disposal at the end of its useful life. the estimates of the cash flows are based on the terms and period of existing transponder utilisation agreements (&#147; existing agreements &#148;). modifications to the terms of the existing agreements that result in shorter utilisation periods than previously agreed and/or those that result in the reduction in agreed rates will result in a lower recoverable amount (if the discount rate used is not changed); which may, in turn, result in a situation wherein the recoverable amounts are less than the carrying amounts (therefore, an impairment loss would need to be recognised). (e) provision for impairment of receivables the issue is covered under credit risk in note 3.1 (b) above. 5. sales and segment information sales: the group&#146;s sales is analysed as follows: 2006 2005 income from provision of satellite transponder capacity - recurring 850,425 850,436 - non-recurring 49,911 &#151; sales of satellite transponder capacity 24,491 24,491 other revenue 5,075 4,778 929,902 879,705 the group has only one business segment, namely the operation, maintenance and provision of satellite telecommunication systems for broadcasting and telecommunications. the group&#146;s primary reporting format for segment reporting purposes under hkas 14 &#147;segment reporting&#148; is the geographical basis. for the purpose of classification, the country where the customer is incorporated is deemed to be the source of sales. however, the group&#146;s operating assets consist primarily of its satellites which are used, or are intended for use, for transmission to multiple geographical areas and therefore cannot be allocated between geographical segments. accordingly, no geographical analysis of expenses, assets and liabilities has been presented. the following table provides an analysis of the group&#146;s sales by geographical markets: 2006 2005 hong kong 341,567 341,698 greater china, including taiwan 194,831 202,730 united states of america 79,813 78,205 united kingdom 53,211 49,401 australia 37,317 27,927 others 223,163 179,744 929,902 879,705 120 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 6. leasehold land and land use rights &#150; group the group&#146;s interests in leasehold land and land use rights represent prepaid operating lease payments and their net book value are analysed as follows: 2006 2005 in hong kong held on: leases of over 50 years &#151; &#151; leases of between 10 to 50 years 23,616 24,199 23,616 24,199 2006 2005 opening 24,199 24,782 amortisation of prepaid operating lease payment (583 ) (583 ) closing 23,616 24,199 121 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 7. property, plant and equipment &#150; group satellites and tracking facilities furniture, fixtures and fittings office equipment motor vehicles plant and equipment total in operation under construction buildings at 1 january 2005 cost 4,232,629 9,635 117,900 10,854 7,646 3,871 2,370 4,384,905 accumulated depreciation (1,467,509 ) &#151; (5,109 ) (8,699 ) (5,764 ) (1,715 ) (1,642 ) (1,490,438 ) net book amount 2,765,120 9,635 112,791 2,155 1,882 2,156 728 2,894,467 year ended 31 december 2005 opening net book amount 2,765,120 9,635 112,791 2,155 1,882 2,156 728 2,894,467 additions 1,337 10,309 98 7,377 1,584 865 &#151; 21,570 transfer 19,539 (19,539 ) &#151; &#151; &#151; &#151; &#151; &#151; disposals (note 27) &#151; &#151; &#151; (7 ) (2 ) &#151; &#151; (9 ) depreciation (286,032 ) &#151; (4,716 ) (2,178 ) (1,068 ) (907 ) (216 ) (295,117 ) closing net book amount 2,499,964 405 108,173 7,347 2,396 2,114 512 2,620,911 at 31 december 2005 cost 4,253,504 405 117,998 11,142 8,928 4,137 2,371 4,398,485 accumulated depreciation (1,753,540 ) &#151; (9,825 ) (3,795 ) (6,532 ) (2,023 ) (1,859 ) (1,777,574 ) net book amount 2,499,964 405 108,173 7,347 2,396 2,114 512 2,620,911 year ended 31 december 2006 opening net book amount 2,499,964 405 108,173 7,347 2,396 2,114 512 2,620,911 additions 6,332 297,537 81 1,747 728 1,111 4 307,540 transfer &#151; (538 ) 538 &#151; &#151; &#151; &#151; &#151; disposals (note 27) &#151; &#151; &#151; (5 ) &#151; &#151; (1 ) (6 ) depreciation (286,448 ) &#151; (4,743 ) (3,951 ) (1,196 ) (1,077 ) (183 ) (297,598 ) closing net book amount 2,219,848 297,404 104,049 5,138 1,928 2,148 332 2,630,847 at 31 december 2006 cost 4,259,836 297,404 118,617 12,879 9,198 4,806 2,372 4,705,112 accumulated depreciation (2,039,988 ) &#151; (14,568 ) (7,741 ) (7,270 ) (2,658 ) (2,040 ) (2,074,265 ) net book amount 2,219,848 297,404 104,049 5,138 1,928 2,148 332 2,630,847 depreciation expense of $297,598 (2005: $295,117) has been expensed in cost of services. 122 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 8. intangible assets &#150; group licences at 1 january 2005 and 31 december 2005 cost 1,500 accumulated amortisation and impairment (161 ) net book amount 1,339 year ended 31 december 2006 opening net book amount 1,339 additions (a) 97 amortisation expense (b) (note 19) (160 ) closing net book amount 1,276 at 31 december 2006 cost 1,597 accumulated amortisation and impairment (321 ) net book amount 1,276 notes: (a) additions refer to the direct-to-home (dth) broadcasting licence fee at macau which has an infinite useful life, as the macau government granted a broadcasting right until the end of the dth project and is carried at cost. the carrying value as at 31 december 2006 was $97 (2005: nil).

1996 scheme &#148;) adopted pursuant to a resolution passed on 3 june 1996, the board of directors of the company may at their discretion grant options to all permanent, full-time employees of the company and its subsidiaries, to subscribe for shares in the company. the primary purpose of the 1996 scheme was to provide incentives to eligible employees. the total number of shares in respect of which options may be granted under the 1996 scheme (including options already exercised) was not permitted to exceed 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the company at any point in time. the maximum number of share options issued to any employee, based on the subscription price of the options, shall not exceed four times the annual basic salary (excluding bonuses and allowances) of that employee. options granted must be taken up within 28 days from the date of grant upon payment of hk$1 per each grant of share options. an option may be exercisable up to 50 per cent on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant, up to 75 per cent on or after the fourth anniversary and fully on or after the fifth anniversary but before the tenth anniversary of the date of offer unless the board of directors specifies 127 part x &#150; financial information relating to the group notes to the consolidated financial statements 15. share capital (continued) other periods. the exercise price was determined by the board of directors and was based on the average closing price of the shares for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of grant. the 1996 scheme was terminated on 25 january 2002 pursuant to a resolution passed on that date. (ii) share option scheme adopted on 25 january 2002 a share option scheme (the &#147; 2002 scheme &#148;) was adopted pursuant to a resolution passed on 25 january 2002 for the primary purpose of attracting and retaining the best personnel for the development of the company&#146;s businesses, and providing incentives to employees, directors, consultants, agents, representatives and advisers, and promoting the long term financial success of the company. the 2002 scheme will expire on 24 january 2012. under the 2002 scheme, the board of directors of the company may at their discretion grant options to the employees, including directors, of the company or any company that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the company, to subscribe for shares in the company. options granted to a director, chief executive or substantial shareholder of the company or any of their respective associates must be approved by the independent non-executive directors of the company (excluding any independent non-executive director who is also the grantee). no options have been granted during 2003 and onwards. at 31 december 2002, the number of shares in respect of which options had been granted under the 2002 scheme was 7,149,500 representing 1.83 per cent of the shares of the company in issue at that date. total consideration received in 2002 from employees for taking up the options granted amounted to hk$105. the total number of shares in respect of which options may be granted under the 2002 scheme and any other schemes is not permitted to exceed 30 per cent of the issued share capital of the company from time to time. in addition, the total number of shares in respect of which options may be granted under the 2002 scheme and any other schemes must not, in aggregate, exceed 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the company at the adoption date of the 2002 scheme, being 39,026,550 shares, without prior approval from the company&#146;s shareholders. the number of shares in respect of which options may be granted to any individual in any one year is not permitted to exceed 1 per cent of the shares of the company in issue, without prior approval from the company&#146;s shareholders. options granted to a substantial shareholder, or an independent non-executive director of the company, or any of their respective associates under the 2002 scheme and any other schemes in any one year in excess of 0.1 per cent of the company&#146;s issued share capital or with a value in excess of hk$5 million must be approved in advance by the company&#146;s shareholders. options granted must be taken up within 28 days from the date of grant upon payment of hk$1 per each grant of share options. the exercise period of the share options granted under the 2002 scheme shall be determined by the board of directors when such options are granted, provided that such period shall not end later than 10 years from the date of grant. the exercise price is determined by the board of directors and will not be less than the higher of the closing price of the company&#146;s shares on the date of grant, or the average closing price of the shares for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of grant, or the nominal value of a share of the company. the financial impact of share options granted is not recorded in the company&#146;s or the group&#146;s balance sheet until such time as the options are exercised, and no charge is recognised in the income statement in respect of the value of options granted in the year. upon the exercise of the share options, the resulting shares issued are recorded by the company as additional share capital at the nominal value of the shares and the excess of the exercise price per share over the nominal value of the shares is recorded by the company in the share premium account. options which are lapsed or are cancelled prior to their exercise dates are deleted from the register of outstanding options. 128 part x &#150;

financial information relating to the group supplementary information for adr holders (b) amortisation and impairment loss of goodwill under hkfrs, hkfrs 3 requires all business combinations for which the agreement date is on or after 1 january 2005 to be accounted for using the purchase method. goodwill acquired in a business combination will no longer be amortised but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually in accordance with hkas 36. upon the adoption of hkfrs 3, the net carrying amount of goodwill carried on the balance sheet is frozen and will be tested for impairment. goodwill previously taken directly to reserves will no longer be subject to impairment testing and will not be recognised in the income statement when all or part of the business to which the goodwill relates is disposed of. accordingly, goodwill previously taken directly to reserves will not impact the income statement in the future upon the adoption of hkas 36. under us gaap, effective from 1 january 2002, goodwill is: (i) no longer amortised, (ii) assigned to a reporting unit and (iii) tested for impairment at least annually. prior to 1 january 2002, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful life, not to exceed 40 years under us gaap. (c) stock compensation under hkfrs, it is not required to apply hkfrs 2 to share options granted on or before 7 november 2002 and vesting before 1 january 2005 (the effective date of hkfrs 2). the company has chosen not to apply hkfrs 2 to share options issued prior to 1 january 2005. under us gaap, effective january 1, 2006 the company adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective approach and accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas 123r. under sfas 123r, stock-based awards granted prior to its adoption will be expensed over the remaining portion of their vesting period, taking into account the estimated forfeiture of options. the fair value options granted was estimated using the black-scholes option-pricing model. compensation expense resulting from the fair value method may not be representative of compensation expense to be incurred in the year concerned.

disposal, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) the transferor agrees to indemnify the potential offerors for all consequences including costs incurred by them in respect of the
