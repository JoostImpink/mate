consummated among members of the wallace e. carroll family (the "carroll family") for purposes of distributing or allocating the jointly held assets of the carroll family to the individual members of the carroll family, trusts for their benefit or the benefit of their descendants, or entities controlled by them. as a result of the reorganization, as described in item 5 below, the dhc family

ownership of certain shares previously reported as jointly beneficially owned by members of the carroll family. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. this statement is filed with respect to shares of the company in which any of the reporting persons have or share voting and investment power. all of the information is presented as of the consummation of the reorganization. following the reorganization, arthur r. miller continues to serve as trustee of certain trusts, not only for the benefit of dhc family stockholders, but also for the benefit of other members of the carroll family, which trusts, in the aggregate own 3,389,529 shares, which represent 39.5% of the outstanding shares. the 471,496 shares owned by mr. miller in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of dhc family stockholders represent 5.5% of the shares outstanding as of the date of the reorganization. information concerning the number and percentage of shares beneficially owned by each of the reporting persons is set forth on the cover pages of this statement, which are incorporated herein by this reference in their entirety. the aggregate 611,246 shares owned by or for the benefit of dhc family

reporting persons is set forth below. in connection with the reorganization, crl, inc. ("crl") redeemed all of the common stock of crl held by the dhc family stockholders in exchange for cash and/or assets. as a result, the dhc family stockholders and the reporting persons (other than arthur r. miller, as trustee) are no longer deemed to beneficially own the shares of the company held by crl. also in connection with the reorganization, lewa company ("lewa"), which was previously a reporting person under the joint schedule 13d filing initially filed on behalf of the wallace e. carroll family on january 15, 1992, as amended, redeemed all of its common stock other than that held by the dhc family stockholders. as part of the consideration for the redemption of lewa common stock, 303,784 and 108,525 shares of the company, respectively, were distributed to wallace e. carroll, jr. and the lelia h. carroll trust u/a dated 7/12/62 f/b/o wallace e. carroll, jr. and his descendants. also in connection with the reorganization, lewa sold directly to crl 19,279 shares of the company at a purchase price of $11.10 per share. these transactions left no shares of the company remaining in lewa or its subsidiaries after the reorganization. d.h. carroll solely beneficially owns 7,898 shares held directly. various trusts for the benefit of d.h. carroll and his descendants (the "dhc trusts") collectively hold 471,496 shares. as a trustee of such trusts, d.h. carroll may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the shares held by the dhc trusts. as a trustee of the holden foundation, d.h. carroll may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the 2,057 shares held by that foundation. an investment partnership, page 9 of 13 pages 10 of which d.h. carroll is a general partner, owns 21,076 shares, of which d.h. carroll may be deemed a beneficial owner. d.h. carroll is also a trustee of the marital trust created under the will of wallace e. carroll (the "marital trust") and an administrator of the wallace e. carroll estate (the "estate") and may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the 55,121 and 53,598 shares, respectively, held by the marital trust and the estate. the foregoing individuals and entities are referred to herein as the "dhc family stockholders." after giving effect to the reorganization, the dhc family stockholders collectively may be deemed to beneficially own approximately 7.1% of the outstanding shares. the dhc family stockholders expressly disclaim that they are acting as a group with any other members of the carroll family for purposes of acquiring, holding or disposing of shares. the following table indicates the direct beneficial ownership of each of the dhc family stockholders: name shares % of class ---- ------ ---------- * d.h. carroll, an individual resident of the state of illinois 7,898 .09% * the wallace e. carroll trust u/a dated 7/1/57 f/b/o d.h. carroll and his descendants 2,151 .02 * the wallace e. and lelia h. carroll trust u/a dated 5/1/58 f/b/o d.h. carroll and his descendants 372,120 4.33 the wallace e. carroll trust u/a dated 1/20/61 f/b/o d.h. carroll and his descendants 16,301 .19 the lelia h. carroll trust u/a dated 7/12/62 f/b/o d.h. carroll and his descendants 72,101 .84 the wallace e. and lelia h. carroll trust u/a dated 12/15/78 f/b/o the descendants of d.h. carroll 8,823 .10 dhc partnership, l.p., an illinois limited partnership 21,076 .25 the marital trust created under the will of wallace e. carroll 55,121 .64 the wallace e. carroll estate 53,598 .62 the holden foundation 2,057 .02 ------- ---- total 611,246 7.10% -
