company option &#148;) that is then outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested and which has a per share exercise price that is less than the closing amount (each, an &#147; in the money option &#148;), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) a cash payment equal to (a) the excess, if any, of (x) the closing amount over (y) the exercise price payable per share of common stock under such company option, multiplied by (b) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such in the money option immediately prior to the effective time (without regard to vesting) and (ii) a cvr with respect to the total number of shares of common stock subject to such in the money option immediately prior to the effective time (without regard to vesting). each company option other than an in the money option that is outstanding and unexercised at the effective time, whether or not vested (each, an &#147;

end date &#148;). if, on the end date, all conditions set forth in annex i to the merger agreement, other than those conditions relating to expiration of the waiting period under the hsr act, have been satisfied or waived by allergan holdco or sapphire, then the end date shall automatically be extended by a period of 90 days. support agreement concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, allergan holdco and sapphire entered into the support agreement with the supporting stockholders, pursuant to which each supporting stockholder agreed, among other things, to tender his, her or its shares of common stock and company options that are exercised prior to the effective time, if any (collectively, the &#147;
