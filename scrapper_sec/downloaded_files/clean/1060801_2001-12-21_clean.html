conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or the creation of any lien under, any contractual obligation of such purchaser or any requirement of law applicable to such purchaser, and (d) do not violate any orders of any governmental authority against, or binding upon, such purchaser. 4.3 governmental authorization; third party consents. no approval, consent, compliance, exemption, authorization or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any governmental authority or any other person, and no lapse of a waiting period under any requirement of law, is necessary or required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by, or enforcement against, such purchaser of this agreement and each of the other transaction documents to which it is a party or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. 4.4 binding effect. this agreement has been, and as of the closing date each of the other transaction documents will have been, duly executed and delivered by such purchaser and this agreement constitutes and, as of the closing date each of the other transaction documents will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligations of such purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). 4.5 purchase for own account. the subject shares and the warrants to be acquired by such purchaser pursuant to this agreement are being or will be acquired for its own account and with no intention of distributing or reselling such subject shares or warrants or any part thereof in any transaction that would be in violation of the securities laws of the united states of america, any state of the united states or any foreign jurisdiction, without prejudice, however, to the rights of such purchaser at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such subject shares or warrants under an effective registration statement under the securities act, or under an exemption from such registration available under the securities act, and subject, nevertheless, to the disposition of such purchaser's property being at all times within its control. if such purchaser should in the future decide to dispose of any of such subject shares, such purchaser understands and agrees that it may do so only in compliance with the securities act and applicable state and foreign securities laws, as then in effect. such purchaser agrees to the imprinting at closing and for so long as required by law, of a 22 legend on certificates representing all of its subject shares, shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of its subject shares and the warrant shares to the following effect: the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), or the securities laws of any state of the united states or any foreign jurisdiction. the securities may not be transferred except pursuant to an effective registration statement under such act and applicable state and foreign securities laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of such act and such laws. 4.6 restricted securities. such purchaser understands that the subject shares and the warrants will not be registered at the time of their issuance under the securities act for the reason that the sale provided for in this agreement is exempt pursuant to section 4(2) of the securities act and that the reliance of the company on such exemption is predicated in part on such purchaser's representations set forth herein. 4.7 accredited investor. such purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of rule 501 of regulation d under the securities act, as presently in effect. 4.8 experience. such purchaser, either alone or together with its representatives, has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in its subject shares and warrants (the "securities"), and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. such purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the securities and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment. 4.9 access to information. such purchaser acknowledges that it has reviewed the sec reports and has been afforded: (i) the opportunity to ask such questions as it has deemed necessary of, and to receive answers from, representatives of the company concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the securities and the merits and risks of investing in the securities; (ii) access to publicly available information about the company and the subsidiaries and the condition of the company sufficient to enable it to evaluate its investment; and (iii) the opportunity to obtain such additional publicly available information that the company possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to the investment. neither such inquiries nor any other investigation conducted by or on behalf of such purchaser or its representatives or 23 counsel shall modify, amend or affect such purchaser's right to rely on the truth, accuracy and completeness of the sec reports and the company's representations and warranties contained in the transaction documents. 4.10 general solicitation. such purchaser is not purchasing the securities as a result of any advertisement, article, notice or other communication regarding the securities published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio or presented at any seminar or any other general solicitation or general advertisement. 4.11 reliance. such purchaser understands and acknowledges that: (i) the securities are being offered and sold to it without registration under the securities act in a private placement that is exempt from the registration provisions of the securities act and (ii) the availability of such exemption depends in part on, and the company will rely upon the accuracy and truthfulness of, the foregoing representations and such purchaser hereby consents to such reliance. article v actions to be taken by the -------------------------- company at the closing ---------------------- at the closing, the company shall take the actions and deliver

note powers attached and (ii) the aggregate purchase price for the warrants to be purchased by such purchaser. article vii indemnification --------------- 7.1 indemnification. except as otherwise provided in this article vii, the company (the "indemnifying party") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the purchasers and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries, partners, members and controlling persons (each, an "indemnified party") to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any and all losses, claims, or written threats thereof (including, without limitation, any claim by a third party), damages, expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in any action between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party or between the indemnified party and any third party or otherwise) or other liabilities (collectively, "losses") resulting from or arising out of any breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement by the 25 company in this agreement, the stockholders agreement, the escrow agreement or the warrants. the amount of any payment to any indemnified party herewith in respect of any loss shall be of sufficient amount to make such indemnified party whole for any diminution in value of the subject shares directly caused by such breach. in connection with the obligation of the indemnifying party to indemnify for expenses as set forth above, the indemnifying party shall, upon presentation of appropriate invoices containing reasonable detail, reimburse each indemnified party for all such expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in any action between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party or between the indemnified party and any third party) as they are incurred by such indemnified party; provided, however, that if an indemnified party is reimbursed under this article vii for any expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall be refunded to the extent it is finally judicially determined that the losses in question resulted primarily from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such indemnified party. 7.2 notification. each indemnified party under this article vii shall, promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of any claim against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought from the indemnifying party under this article vii, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof. the omission of any indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party of any such action shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party (a) other than pursuant to this article vii or (b) under this article vii unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the indemnifying party's forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses. in case any such claim shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party in its reasonable judgment; provided, however, that any indemnified party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense at its own expense. notwithstanding the foregoing, in any claim in which both the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and an indemnified party, on the other hand, are, or are reasonably likely to become, a party, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to control its own defense of such claim if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, either (x) one or more defenses are available to the indemnified party that are not available to the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, that would make such separate representation advisable; provided, however, that the indemnifying party (i) shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel to all indemnified parties and (ii) shall reimburse the indemnified parties for all of such fees and expenses of such counsel incurred in any action between the indemnifying party and the indemnified parties or between the indemnified parties and any third party, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that if an indemnified party is reimbursed under this article vii for any expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall be refunded to the extent it is finally judicially determined that the losses in question resulted primarily from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such indemnified party. the indemnifying party agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, 26 settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim relating to the matters contemplated hereby (if any indemnified party is a party thereto or has been actually threatened to be made a party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected against an indemnified party without the indemnifying party's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. the rights accorded to an indemnified party hereunder shall be in addition to any rights that any indemnified party may have at common law, by separate agreement or otherwise; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, nothing in this article vii shall restrict or limit any rights that any indemnified party may have to seek equitable relief. 7.3 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article vii from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative faults of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in sections 7.1 and 7.2, any reasonable legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. article viii affirmative covenants --------------------- the company hereby covenants and agrees with the purchasers as follows: 8.1 financial statements and other information. if any time the company is not

(b) registrable securities. for the purposes of this agreement, registrable securities will cease to be registrable securities, when (i) a registration statement covering such registrable securities has been declared effective under the securities act by the commission and such registrable securities have been disposed of pursuant to such effective registration statement, (ii) (x) the entire amount of the registrable securities owned by a designated holder may be sold in a single sale, in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the company and such designated holder, each in their reasonable judgment, without any limitation as to volume pursuant to rule 144 (or any successor provision then in effect) under the securities act and (y) such designated holder owning such registrable securities owns less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis, or (iii) the registrable securities are proposed to be sold or distributed by a person not entitled to the registration rights granted by this agreement. (c) holders of registrable securities. a person is deemed to be a holder of registrable securities whenever such person owns of record registrable securities, or holds an option to purchase, or a security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, registrable securities whether or not such acquisition or conversion has actually been effected. if the company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more persons with respect to the same registrable securities, the company may act upon the basis of the instructions, notice or election received from the registered owner of such registrable securities. registrable securities issuable upon exercise of an option or upon conversion of another security shall be deemed outstanding for the purposes of this agreement. 3. demand registration. (a) request for demand registration. at any time commencing one year after the date hereof, either the general atlantic stockholders or the cenwell stockholders (the "initiating holders"), may each make a written request to the company to register, and the company shall register, under the securities act and on an appropriate registration statement form as reasonably determined by the company and approved by the initiating holders (a "demand registration"), the number of registrable securities stated in such request; provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to effect more than one such demand registration for the general atlantic stockholders (subject to section 3(e)(ii) below) and more than one such demand registration for the cenwell stockholders (subject to section 3(e)(ii) below). if following receipt of a written request for a demand registration the board of directors, in its good faith judgment, determines that any registration of registrable securities should not be made or continued because it would materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or merger or other material transaction involving the company (a "valid business reason"), the company may (x) postpone filing a registration statement relating to a demand registration until such valid business reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than ninety (90) days, and 6 (y) in case a registration statement has been filed relating to a demand registration, if the valid business reason has not resulted from actions taken by the company, the company, upon the approval of a majority of the board of directors, such majority to include at least one director appointed by the general atlantic stockholders, may cause such registration statement to be withdrawn and its effectiveness terminated or may postpone amending or supplementing such registration statement. the company shall give written notice of its determination to postpone or withdraw a registration statement and of the fact that the valid business reason for such postponement or withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the company may not postpone or withdraw a filing under this section 3(a) more than once in any twelve (12) month period. each request for a demand registration by the initiating holders shall state the amount of the registrable securities proposed to be sold and the intended method of disposition thereof. (b) incidental or "piggy-back" rights with respect to a demand registration. each of the designated holders (other than initiating holders which have requested a registration under section 3(a)) may offer its or his registrable securities under any demand registration pursuant to this section 3(b). within five (5) days after the receipt of a request for a demand registration from an initiating holder, the company shall (i) give written notice thereof to all of the designated holders (other than initiating holders which have requested a registration under section 3(a)) and (ii) subject to section 3(e), include in such registration all of the registrable securities held by such designated holders from whom the company has received a written request for inclusion therein within ten (10) days of the receipt by such designated holders of such written notice referred to in clause (i) above. each such request by such designated holders shall specify the number of registrable securities proposed to be registered. the failure of any designated holder to respond within such 10 day period referred to in clause (ii) above shall be deemed to be a waiver of such designated holder's rights under this section 3 with respect to such demand registration. any designated holder may waive its rights under this section 3 prior to the expiration of such 10-day period by giving written notice to the company, with a copy to the initiating holders. if a designated holder sends the company a written request for inclusion of part or all of such designated holder's registrable securities in a registration, such designated holder shall not be entitled to withdraw or revoke such request without the prior written consent of the company in its sole discretion unless, as a result of facts or circumstances arising after the date on which such request was made relating to the company or to market conditions, such designated holder reasonably determines that participation in such registration would have a material adverse effect on such designated holder. (c) effective demand registration. the company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such demand registration to be filed not later than thirty (30) days after it receives a request under section 3(a) hereof and to become and remain effective as soon as practicable thereafter but, in any event, not later than ninety (90) days after such filing. a registration shall not constitute a demand registration until it has become effective and remains continuously effective for the lesser of (i) the period during which all registrable securities registered in the demand registration are sold and (ii) 120 days; provided, however, that a registration shall not 6 constitute a demand registration if (x) after such demand registration has become effective, such registration or the related offer, sale or distribution of registrable securities thereunder is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the initiating holders and such interference is not thereafter eliminated or (y) the conditions specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such demand registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure by the initiating holder. (d) expenses. the company shall pay all registration expenses in connection with a demand registration, whether or not such demand registration becomes effective. (e) underwriting procedures. (i) if the company or the initiating holders holding a majority of the registrable securities held by all of the initiating holders so elect, the company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such demand registration to be in the form of a firm commitment underwritten offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering shall be the approved underwriter selected in accordance with section 3(f). in connection with any demand registration under this section 3 involving an underwritten offering, none of the registrable securities held by any designated holder making a request for inclusion of such registrable securities pursuant to section 3(b) hereof shall be included in such underwritten offering unless such designated holder accepts the terms of the offering as agreed upon by the company, the initiating holders and the approved underwriter, and then only in such quantity as will not, in the opinion of the approved underwriter, jeopardize the success of such offering by the initiating holders. if the approved underwriter advises the company in its reasonable opinion that the aggregate amount of such registrable securities requested to be included in such offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the success of such offering, then the company shall include in such registration only the aggregate amount of registrable securities that the approved underwriter believes may be sold without any such material adverse effect and shall reduce the amount of registrable securities to be included in such registration by removing from such registration securities owned, first by the company and second by the designated holders (including the initiating holders) pro rata based on the number of registrable securities owned by each such designated holder. (ii) if an initiating holder makes a request for a demand registration and, pursuant to section 3(e)(i) above, the approved underwriter advises the company to reduce the aggregate amount of registrable securities requested to be included in such offering such that less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the registrable securities requested to be included by any initiating holder are ultimately included in and sold pursuant to such demand registration, the initiating holder shall have the right to require the company to effect an additional demand registration; provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate number of demand registrations to be effected by the company for any one initiating holder exceed two (2). 8 (f) selection of underwriters. if any demand registration of registrable securities is in the form of an underwritten offering, the company shall select and obtain an investment banking firm of national reputation to act as the managing underwriter of the offering (the "approved underwriter"); provided, however, that the approved underwriter shall, in any case, also be approved by the initiating holders. 4. incidental or "piggy-back" registration. (a) request for incidental registration. if at any time the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering by the company for its own account (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 or any successor thereto) or for the account of any stockholder of the company other than the designated holders, then the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to each of the designated holders at least twenty (20) days before the anticipated filing date, and such notice shall describe the proposed registration and distribution and offer such designated holders the opportunity to register the number of registrable securities as each such designated holder may request (an "incidental registration"). the company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts (within twenty (20) days of the notice provided for in the preceding sentence) to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters in the case of a proposed underwritten offering (the "company underwriter") to permit each of the designated holders who have requested in writing to participate in the incidental registration to include its or his registrable securities in such offering on the same terms and conditions as the securities of the company or the account of such other stockholder, as the case may be, included therein. in connection with any incidental registration under this section 4(a) involving an underwritten offering, the company shall not be required to include any registrable securities in such underwritten offering unless the designated holders thereof accept the terms of the underwritten offering as agreed upon between the company, such other stockholders, if any, and the company underwriter, and then only in such quantity as the company underwriter believes will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the company. if the company underwriter determines that the registration of all or part of the registrable securities which the designated holders have requested to be included would materially adversely affect the success of such offering, then the company shall be required to include in such incidental registration, to the extent of the amount that the company underwriter believes may be sold without causing such adverse effect, first, all of the securities to be offered for the account of the company or on the account of the selling stockholder that caused the registration statement that has triggered the incidental registration to be filed, as the case may be; second, the registrable securities to be offered for the account of the designated holders pursuant to this section 4, pro rata based on the number of registrable securities owned by each such designated holder; and third, any other securities requested to be included in such offering. (b) expenses. the company shall bear all registration expenses in connection with any incidental registration pursuant to this section 4, whether or not such incidental registration becomes effective. 9 5. holdback agreements. (a) restrictions on public sale by designated holders. to the extent (i) requested (a) by the company or the initiating holders, as the case may be, in the case of a non-underwritten public offering and (b) by the approved underwriter or the company underwriter, as the case may be, in the case of an underwritten public offering and (ii) all of the company's officers, directors and holders in excess of one percent (1%) of its outstanding capital stock execute agreements identical to those referred to in this section 5(a), each designated holder agrees (x) not to effect any public sale or distribution of any registrable securities or of any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such registrable securities, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, or offer to sell, contract to sell (including without limitation any short sale), grant any option to purchase or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a public sale any registrable securities and (y) not to make any request for a demand registration under this agreement, during the ninety (90) day period or such shorter period, if any, mutually agreed upon by such designated holder and the requesting party beginning on the effective date of the registration statement (except as part of such registration) for such public offering. no designated holder of registrable securities subject to this section 5(a) shall be released from any obligation under any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into pursuant to this section 5(a) unless all other designated holders of registrable securities subject to the same obligation are also released. all designated holders of registrable securities shall be automatically released from any obligations under any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into pursuant to this section 5(a) immediately upon the expiration of the 90 day period.

(iv) register or qualify such registrable securities under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any seller of registrable securities may request, and to continue such qualification in effect in such jurisdiction for as long as permissible pursuant to the laws of such jurisdiction, or for as long as any such seller requests or until all of such registrable securities are sold, whichever is shortest, and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable any such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the registrable securities owned by such seller; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to (x) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this section 6(a)(iv), (y) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; 11 (v) notify each seller of registrable securities at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the company shall promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus and furnish to each seller of registrable securities a reasonable number of copies of such supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, after delivery to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(a) indemnification by the company. the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each designated holder, its partners, directors, officers, affiliates and each person who controls (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act) such designated holder from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) (each, a "liability" and collectively, "liabilities"), arising out of or based upon any untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, except insofar as such liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission contained in such registration statement, preliminary 14 prospectus or final prospectus in reliance and in conformity with information concerning such designated holder furnished in writing to the company by such designated holder expressly for use therein, including, without limitation, the information furnished to the company pursuant to section 7(b). the company shall also provide customary indemnities to any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers, directors and employees and each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the designated holders of registrable securities. (b) indemnification by designated holders. in connection with any registration statement in which a designated holder is participating pursuant to section 3 or section 4 hereof, each such designated holder shall promptly furnish to the company in writing such information with respect to such designated holder as the company may reasonably request or as may be required by law for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the company by such designated holder not materially misleading or necessary to cause such registration statement not to omit a material fact with respect to such designated holder necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. each designated holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, any underwriter retained by the company and each person who controls the company or such underwriter (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to the designated holders, but only if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information with respect to such designated holder furnished in writing to the company by such designated holder expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus, including, without limitation, the information furnished to the company pursuant to this section 7(b); provided, however, that the total amount to be indemnified by such designated holder pursuant to this section 7(b) shall be limited to the net proceeds (after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions) received by such designated holder in the offering to which the registration statement or prospectus relates. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. any person entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "indemnified party") agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the "indemnifying party") after the receipt by the indemnified party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which the indemnified party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this agreement; provided, however, that the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to the indemnified party hereunder (except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). if notice of commencement of any such action is given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of 15 such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and such parties have been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such indemnified party and the indemnifying party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party. in any of such cases, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of such indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is a party and indemnity has been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability for claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 7 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative faults of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in sections 7(a), 7(b) and 7(c), any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding; provided that the total amount to be contributed by such designated holder shall be limited to the net proceeds (after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions) received by such designated holder in the offering. 16 the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8. rule 144. the company covenants that it shall (a) file any reports required to be filed by it under the exchange act and (b) take such further action as each designated holder may reasonably request (including providing any information necessary to comply with rule 144 under the securities act), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such designated holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time or (ii) any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the commission. the company shall, upon the request of any designated holder, deliver to such designated holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 9. miscellaneous. (a) recapitalizations, exchanges, etc. the provisions of this agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth herein with respect to (i) the shares of common stock, (ii) any and all shares of voting common stock of the company into which the shares of common stock are converted, exchanged or substituted in any recapitalization or other capital reorganization by the company and (iii) any and all equity securities of the company or any successor or assign of the company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) which may be issued in respect of, in conversion of, in exchange for or in substitution of, the shares of common stock and shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, reverse splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date hereof. the company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause any successor or assign (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) to enter into a new registration rights agreement with the designated holders on terms substantially the same as this agreement as a condition of any such transaction. (b) no inconsistent agreements. the company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the designated holders in this agreement or grant any additional registration rights to any person or with respect to any securities which are not registrable securities which are prior in right to or inconsistent with the rights granted in this agreement. (c) remedies. the designated holders, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, shall be entitled to specific performance of their rights under this agreement. the company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this agreement and hereby agrees to 17 waive in any action for specific performance the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. (d) amendments and waivers. except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless consented to in writing by (i) the company and (ii) the general atlantic stockholders, cenwell stockholders and vectis stockholders holding registrable securities representing (after giving effect to any adjustments) at least a majority of the aggregate number of registrable securities owned by all of the general atlantic stockholders, cenwell stockholders and vectis stockholders; provided, however, that to the extent any amendment or waiver shall adversely affect any of the stockholders, such amendment or waiver shall require the prior written consent of each stockholder so adversely affected. any such written consent shall be binding upon the company and all of the designated holders.
