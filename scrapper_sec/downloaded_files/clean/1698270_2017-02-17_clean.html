(d) if the company receives a distribution from or in respect of which tax has been withheld, the company shall be treated as having received cash in an amount equal to the amount of such withheld tax, and each member shall be treated as having received as a distribution the portion of such amount that is attributable to such member&#146;s interest in the company as equitably determined by the managing member.
