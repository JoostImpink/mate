(c) distributions with respect to unexchanged shares. no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the effective time with respect to the class a common stock with a record date after the effective time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate until the a-3 holder of such certificate shall surrender such certificate. subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of class a common stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of class a common stock.

(3) (a) at every meeting of the stockholders of the corporation every holder of class a common stock shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of class a common stock standing in his or her name on the transfer books of the corporation, and every holder of class b common stock shall be entitled to six votes in person or by proxy for each share of class b common stock standing in his or her name on the transfer books of the corporation in connection with the election of directors and all other matters submitted to a vote of stockholders; provided, however, that with respect to any proposed conversion of the shares of class b common stock into shares of class a common stock pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(b), every holder of a share of common stock, irrespective of class, shall have one vote in person or by proxy for each share of common stock standing in his or her name on the transfer books of the corporation and provided, further, however, that, upon any transfer of the class b common stock, or any class a common stock into which class b common stock may have been converted at any time on or after the date of this restated certificate of incorporation, the class b common stock, or class a common stock, so transferred shall have no voting rights, unless such transfer is first approved by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote thereon, in which case the class b common stock, or class a common stock, so transferred shall retain its voting rights granted hereunder. except as may be otherwise required by law or by this article fourth, the holders of class a common stock and class b common stock shall vote together as a single class, subject to any voting rights which may be granted to holders of preferred stock, on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of common stock. (b) every reference in this restated certificate of incorporation to a majority or other proportion of shares of common stock, class a common stock or class b common stock, shall b-2 refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes to which such shares of common stock, class a common stock or class b common stock are entitled. (4) in the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment in full of the amounts required to be paid to the holders of preferred stock, the remaining assets and funds of the corporation shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of class a common stock and class b common stock. for the purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), the voluntary sale, conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation or a consolidation or merger of the corporation with one or more other corporations (whether or not the corporation is the corporation surviving such consolidation or merger) shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary. (5) (a) prior to the date on which shares of class b common stock are issued to stockholders of delia*s inc. or its successors ("delia*s") in a tax-free spin-off (as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(b)), each share of class b common stock is convertible at the option of the holder thereof into one share of class a common stock. at the time of a voluntary conversion, the holder of shares of class b common stock shall deliver to the office of the corporation or any transfer agent for the class b common stock (i) the certificate or certificates representing the shares of class b common stock to be converted, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer, and (ii) written notice to the corporation stating that such holder elects to convert such share or shares and stating the name and address in which each certificate for shares of class a common stock issued upon such conversion is to be issued. to the extent permitted by law and subject to the taking of any necessary action, such voluntary conversion shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the date when such delivery is made to the corporation or such transfer agent of the shares to be converted, and the person exercising such voluntary conversion shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon such conversion at such time. the corporation shall promptly deliver certificates evidencing the appropriate number of shares of class a common stock to such person. (b) each share of class b common stock shall automatically convert into one share of class a common stock upon the transfer of such share if, after such transfer, such share is not beneficially owned by delia*s or any of its subsidiaries (except a "strategic partner," as defined below), unless such transfer is effected in connection with a transfer of class b common stock to stockholders of delia*s as a dividend intended to be on a tax-free basis under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "code") (a "tax-free spin-off"). for purposes of this paragraph (d)(5) and articles seventh and ninth, (i) the term "beneficially owned" with respect to shares of class b common stock means ownership by a person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise controls the voting power (which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of) of such class b common stock, and (ii) the term "strategic partner" means any entity, or group of affiliated entities, acquiring class b common stock constituting, in the aggregate, at least 10% of the outstanding common stock and which, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors who are not directors, officers of the beneficial owners of five percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of delia*s is considered to constitute a strategic alliance in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders. in the event of a tax-free spin-off, shares of class b common stock shall automatically convert into shares of class a common stock on the fifth anniversary of the date on which shares of class b common stock are first transferred to stockholders of delia*s in a tax-free spin-off unless, prior to such tax-free spin-off, delia*s delivers to the corporation an opinion of delia*s counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the b-3 corporation) to the effect that such conversion would preclude delia*s from obtaining a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service that the distribution would be a tax-free spin-off under the code. if such an opinion is received, approval of such conversion shall be submitted to a vote of the holders of the common stock as soon as practicable after the fifth anniversary of the tax-free spin-off unless delia*s delivers to the corporation an opinion of delia*s counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the corporation) prior to such anniversary to the effect that such vote would adversely affect the status of the tax-free spin-off. at the meeting of stockholders called for such purpose, every holder of common stock shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of common stock standing in his or her name on the transfer books of the corporation. approval of such conversion shall require the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock present and voting, voting together as a single class, and the holders of the class b common stock shall not be entitled to a separate class vote. such conversion shall be effective on the date on which such approval is given at a meeting of stockholders called for such purpose. each share of class b common stock beneficially owned by any person shall automatically convert into one share of class a common stock if a tax-free spin-off has not occurred and the number of shares of class b common stock beneficially owned by such person is or becomes less than 10 percent of the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock and class b common stock then outstanding. the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued common stock and its issued common stock held in its treasury for the purpose of effecting any conversion of the class b common stock pursuant to this paragraph (d)(5), the full number of shares of class a common stock then deliverable upon any such conversion of all outstanding shares of class b common stock. the corporation will provide notice of any automatic conversion of shares of class b common stock to holders of record of the common stock not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such conversion; provided, however, that if the timing or nature of the effectiveness of an automatic conversion makes it impracticable to provide at least 30 days' notice, the corporation shall provide such notice as soon as practicable. such notice shall be provided by mailing notice of such conversion first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record of the common stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the corporation; provided, however, that no failure to give such notice nor any defect therein shall affect the validity of the automatic conversion of any shares of class b common stock. each such notice shall state, as appropriate, the following: (i) the automatic conversion date; (ii) the number of outstanding shares of class b common stock that are to be converted automatically; (iii) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for conversion; and (iv) that no dividends will be declared on the shares of class b common stock converted after such conversion date. immediately upon such conversion, the rights of the holders of shares of class b common stock as such shall cease and such holders shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record owners of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon such conversion; provided, however, that such persons shall be entitled to receive when paid any dividends declared on the b-4 class b common stock as of a record date preceding the time of such conversion and unpaid as of the time of such conversion. as promptly as practicable after the time of conversion, upon the delivery to the corporation of certificates formerly representing shares of class b common stock, the corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered, to or upon the written order of the record holder of the surrendered certificates formerly representing shares of class b common stock, a certificate or certificates representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of class a common stock into which the shares of class b common stock formerly represented by such certificates have been converted in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (d)(5). (c) the corporation will pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of one class of common stock on the conversion of shares of the other class of common stock pursuant to this paragraph (d)(5); provided, however, that the corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any registration of transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of one class of common stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the other class of common stock converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid. (d) concurrently with any conversion of class b common stock into class a common stock effected pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(a) and (b) above, each share of class b common stock that is converted (i) shall be retired and canceled and shall not be reissued and (ii) shall proportionally decrease the number of shares of class b common stock designated hereby. the secretary of the corporation shall be, and hereby is, authorized and directed to file with the secretary of state of the state of delaware one or more certificates of decrease of designated shares to record any such decrease in designated shares of common stock. no undesignated shares of common stock shall be designated shares of class b common stock following an automatic conversion of shares of class b common stock pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(b) above. section 3. preferred stock. (a) series and limits of variations between series. any unissued or treasury shares of the preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series for such consideration as may be fixed from time to time by the board of directors and each share of a series shall be identical in all respects with the other shares of such series, except that, if the dividends thereon are cumulative, the date from which they shall be cumulative may differ. before any shares of preferred stock of any particular series shall be issued, a certificate shall be filed with the secretary of state of delaware setting forth the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, and conditions to be attached to the preferred stock of such series and such other matters as may be required, and the board of directors shall fix and determine, and is hereby expressly empowered to fix and determine, in the manner provided by law, the particulars of the shares of such series (so far as not inconsistent with the provisions of this article fourth applicable to all series of preferred stock), including, but not limited to, the following: (1) the distinctive designation of such series and the number of shares which shall constitute such series, which number may be increased (except where otherwise provided by the board of directors in creating such series) or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) from time to time by like action of the board of directors; (2) the annual rate of dividends payable on shares of such series, the conditions upon which such dividends shall be payable and the date from which dividends shall be cumulative in the event the board of directors determines that dividends shall be cumulative; b-5 (3) whether such series shall have voting rights, in addition to the voting rights provided by law and, if so, the terms of such voting rights; (4) whether such series shall have conversion privileges and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion, including, but not limited to, provision for adjustment of the conversion rate upon such events and in such manner as the board of directors shall determine; (5) whether or not the shares of such series shall be redeemable and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption, including the date or dates upon or after which they shall be redeemable, and the amount per share payable in case of redemption, which amount may vary under different conditions and at different redemption dates; (6) whether such series shall have a sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of that series and, if so, the terms and amount of such sinking fund; (7) the rights of the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of shares of that series; and (8) any other relative rights, preferences and limitations of such series. section 4. no preemptive rights. except as otherwise set forth above in this article fourth, no holder of shares of this corporation of any class shall be entitled, as such, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or purchase shares of any class now or hereafter authorized, or to purchase or subscribe for securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the corporation or to which there shall be attached or appertain any warrants or rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase or subscribe for shares. fifth. section 1. amendment of bylaws by directors. in furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind the bylaws of the corporation. section 2. amendment of bylaws by the stockholders. the bylaws shall not be made, repealed, altered, amended or rescinded by the stockholders of the corporation except by the vote of not less than 75 percent of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote thereon. any amendment to the certificate of incorporation which shall contravene any bylaw in existence on the record date of the stockholders meeting at which such amendment is to be voted upon by the stockholders shall require the vote of not less than 75 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. sixth. section 1. classified board. effective immediately upon the issuance of more than 1,000 shares of common stock of the corporation, the board of directors (exclusive of directors to be elected by the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock voting separately as a class or classes) shall be divided into three classes, class a, class b, and class c. the number of directors in each class shall be the whole number contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the authorized number of directors by three, and if a fraction is also contained in such quotient, then if such fraction is one-third, the extra director shall be a member of class a and if the fraction is two thirds, one of the extra directors shall be a member of class a and the other shall be a member of class b. each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting following the annual meeting at which such director was elected; provided, however, that the directors first elected to class a shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting next following the end of the calendar year 1999, the directors first elected to class b shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting next following the end of the calendar year 2000, and the directors first elected to class c shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting next following the end of the calendar year 2001. notwithstanding the foregoing formula provisions, in the event that, as a result of any change in the authorized number of directors, the number of directors in any class would differ b-6 from the number allocated to that class under the formula provided in this article sixth immediately prior to such change, the following rules shall govern: (a) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which such director is a member until the expiration of his current term, or his prior death, resignation or removal; (b) at each subsequent election of directors, even if the number of directors in the class whose term of office then expires is less than the number then allocated to that class under said formula, the number of directors then elected for membership in that class shall not be greater than the number of directors in that class whose term of office then expires, unless and to the extent that the aggregate number of directors then elected plus the number of directors in all classes then duly continuing in office does not exceed the then authorized number of directors of the corporation; (c) at each subsequent election of directors, if the number of directors in the class whose term of office then expires exceeds the number then allocated to that class under said formula, the board of directors shall designate one or more of the directorships then being elected as directors of another class or classes in which the number of directors then serving is less than the number then allocated to such other class or classes under said formula; (d) in the event of the death, resignation or removal of any director who is a member of a class in which the number of directors serving immediately preceding the creation of such vacancy exceeded the number then allocated to that class under said formula, the board of directors shall designate the vacancy thus created as a vacancy in another class in which the number of directors then serving is less than the number then allocated to such other class under said formula; (e) in the event of any increase in the authorized number of directors, the newly created directorships resulting from such increase shall be apportioned by the board of directors to such class or classes as shall, so far as possible, bring the composition of each of the classes into conformity with the formula in this article sixth, as it applies to the number of directors authorized immediately following such increase; and (f) designation of directorships or vacancies into other classes and apportionments of newly created directorships to classes by the board of directors under the foregoing items (c), (d) and (e) shall, so far as possible, be effected so that the class whose term of office is due to expire next following such designation or apportionment shall contain the full number of directors then allocated to said class under said formula. notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this article sixth, each director shall serve until his successor is elected and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal. section 2. election by holders of preferred stock. during any period when the holders of any preferred stock or any one or more series thereof, voting as a class, shall be entitled to elect a specified number of directors, by reason of dividend arrearages or other provisions giving them the right to do so, then and during such time as such right continues (i) the then otherwise authorized number of directors shall be increased by such specified number of directors, and the holders of such preferred stock or such series thereof, voting as a class, shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for, pursuant to the provisions of such preferred stock or series; (ii) each such additional director shall serve for such term, and have such voting powers, as shall be stated in the provisions pertaining to such preferred stock or series; and (iii) whenever the holders of any such preferred stock or series thereof are divested of such rights to elect a specified number of directors, voting as a class, pursuant to the provisions of such preferred stock or series, the terms of office of all directors elected by the holders of such preferred stock or series, voting as a class pursuant to such provisions or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation or removal of directors b-7 so elected by the holders of such preferred stock or series, shall forthwith terminate and the authorized number of directors shall be reduced accordingly. section 3. ballots. elections of directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws of the corporation shall provide otherwise. section 4. elimination of certain personal liability of directors. a director of this corporation shall not be

a vice chairman of the board of directors, the president or, at the request in writing of a majority of the board of directors, any officer. section 2. action by written consent. any corporate action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any corporate action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the corporate action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in delaware (either by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested), its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded; provided, however, that on and after the date on which none of delia*s, any of its subsidiaries, any strategic partner or stephen i. kahn beneficially owns in the aggregate 50 percent or more of the total voting power of all classes of outstanding common stock, any corporate action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, or any corporate action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, may be taken only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent of the stockholders in lieu of such meeting. so long as stockholders are entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting in accordance with this article seventh, every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the date the earliest dated consent is delivered to the corporation, a written

a corporate opportunity for both delia*s and the corporation, delia*s shall have no duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to the corporation and shall not be liable to the

corporation or delia*s as such director, officer or employee deems appropriate under the circumstances in his sole discretion, and no such director, officer or employee shall be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty or duty of loyalty or failure to act in (or not opposed to) the best interests of the corporation or the derivation of any improper

regarding such corporate opportunity to the corporation or (ii) delia*s pursues or acquires such corporate opportunity for itself or directs such corporate opportunity to another person or does not

outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock of the corporation and no person who is a director or officer of the corporation is also a director or officer of delia*s. neither

and the other parties listed on exhibit a (such other parties, the "family holders"). the family holders and sik are referred to collectively as the "existing stockholders". each family holder owns the number of shares of the company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (generally, "common stock"), set forth beside the family holder's name on exhibit a to this agreement. the parties agree as follows: 1. restrictions on transfer generally. 1.1 transfers to be made only as permitted or required by this agreement. for a period of six months from the date of this agreement, no family holder may, directly or indirectly, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of (each, a "transfer") any shares of the company's common stock without the prior written consent of hambrecht & quist llc. thereafter, no family holder may, directly or indirectly, transfer any shares of the company's common stock, except as specifically permitted by this agreement. the company shall not record on its books and records any purported transfer of shares not permitted by this agreement, and any such purported transfer shall have no force or effect. 1.2 permitted transfers. each family holder, other than a family holder that owns shares of common stock as an executor, guardian, committee, trustee or other fiduciary, may transfer any of such family holder's shares of common stock to such family holder's spouse, heirs or descendants or any executor, guardian, committee, trustee or other fiduciary acting as such on behalf or for the benefit of such family holder or any such spouse, heir or descendant with respect to such transfer. any family holder that owns shares of common stock as an executor, guardian, committee, trustee or other fiduciary may transfer any of such shares to: (a) the person or persons on whose behalf or for whose benefit such shares are held; (b) any other executor, guardian, committee, trustee or other fiduciary acting as such on behalf or for the benefit of the person or persons on whose behalf or for whose benefit such shares are held; or (c) any spouse or descendant of the person or persons on whose behalf or for whose benefit such shares are held. no transfer otherwise permitted by this section 1.2 or by section 1.3 of this agreement may be effected, unless, at or prior to such transfer, the transferee executes and delivers to the company and to sik, for the company's benefit and for the benefit of each other existing stockholder, a written agreement by the transferee (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company and sik) to be bound by this agreement, including without limitation section 4 hereof (and, if sik requests, an irrevocable proxy as provided in section 4), as if the transferee were the transferring family holder. in addition, any family holder may transfer any shares of common stock to any other existing stockholder or any other person permitted under this section 1.2 (any such other person being referred to as a "permitted transferee"). 1.3 piggyback sales. each family holder may sell the number of shares of common stock owned by such family holder that are actually included in a filed registration statement in accordance with section 2 of this agreement. 1.4 rule 144 transfers. after the second anniversary of this agreement, each family holder may transfer shares of common stock, in the same amounts and in the same manner as that family holder would be permitted to transfer shares, if the family holder was an affiliate (as defined in rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act") of the company. 1.5 approved transfers. any family holder may transfer any shares of common stock to any other person, firm or entity with the prior written consent of sik (which sik may withhold for any reason or for no reason in his sole discretion). 2. registration rights 2.1 piggyback registration. if at any time after the initial public offering of the company's common stock, sik proposes to include in a registration statement being filed under the securities act on any form (other than on form s-8 or any successor form) any shares of common stock he owns, the company or sik shall give written notice to each family holder at least 10 days before the initial filing of that registration statement, which notice (a "notice of registration") shall set forth the intended method of disposition of the securities proposed to be registered by sik. each notice of registration shall offer to include in the registration statement up to a number of shares of common stock owned by each family holder equal to the product of (a) the number of shares owned by such family holder and/or such family holder's permitted transferees as of the date of the agreement and (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares sik proposes to include in the registration statement and the denominator of which is the total number of shares sik owns as of the date of the agreement. if any family holder or permitted transferee desires to have shares of common stock (up to the maximum number permitted by the preceding sentence) so included, such family holder or permitted transferee shall so notify sik and the company in writing, within 10 days after the date of delivery of the notice of registration, specifying the number of shares for which registration is requested. the company shall thereupon include in the registration statement the number of shares of common stock for which registration is so requested, subject to the next sentence. if the managing underwriter of a proposed public offering that is the subject of any such registration statement advises the company or sik in writing that, in its opinion, the distribution of the shares requested to be included in the registration by all family holders, their permitted transferees and all other selling stockholders (including sik) would adversely affect a distribution by the company covered by such registration statement, the number of shares requested to be registered by family holders and 2 permitted transferees shall be reduced in the same proportion as the number of shares of all other selling stockholders (including sik) is reduced. 2.2 expenses. all expenses incurred in complying with this section 2, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, expenses of any special audits incident to or required by any such registration and expenses of complying with the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdictions, shall be paid by the company, except that the company shall not (without its prior written consent) be liable for (a) any fees, discounts or commissions to any underwriter or broker and (b) the fees or expenses of more than one counsel to sik, the family holders and permitted transferees (which counsel may, in sik's discretion, be selected by sik and may also be the company's counsel). 2.3 documentation and information. each family holder undertakes to execute and deliver all agreements, certificates and other documents, and to provide all information, in connection with or in furtherance of the registration of the family holder's shares of common stock pursuant to this section 2 as may from time to time be requested by sik or the company in his or its discretion. 3. "market stand-off" agreement. sik may request that any family holder refrain from transferring any shares of common stock for a period of up to 90 days following the filing of a registration statement of the company under the securities act (a "90-day stand-off request"); however, sik may not make more than one such request of each family holder in any 365-day period. in addition, sik may, on one occasion, request that each family holder refrain from transferring any shares of common stock for a period of up to 180 days following the filing of a registration statement under the securities act, which right may not be exercised during any 365-day period in which sik has made a 90-day stand-off request. if sik makes any request as permitted by this section 3, each family holder shall refrain from transferring any shares of common stock during the period specified in such request. 4. voting. each family holder shall be present in person or by proxy at all meetings of the stockholders of the company to enable all shares owned by such family holder (and such family holder's permitted transferees) to be counted for quorum purposes. concurrently with the execution of this agreement, each family holder is executing the form of irrevocable proxy annexed as exhibit b and delivering it to sik. 5. term. sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this agreement shall terminate and be of no force or effect after the tenth anniversary of this agreement. 6. representation and warranty. each family holder represents and warrants to the company and sik that, except for this agreement and lock-up agreements entered into with the underwriters of the company's initial public offering, such family holder is not a party to or bound by any voting agreement, voting trust, proxy or any other agreement, instrument or understanding with 3 respect to the ownership or voting of common stock or any other capital stock or security of the company, or any agreement with respect to the transfer, purchase or redemption of any common stock or any other capital stock or security of the company. 7. miscellaneous 7.1 legend. as long as any of sections 1, 2, 3 or 4 hereof remains in effect (or unless such requirement is waived by sik), each certificate representing shares of common stock owned by any family holder (or permitted transferee) shall bear a legend substantially as follows: "the rights or shares represented by this certificate are subject to a stockholders agreement dated december 18, 1996, which, among other things, restricts the voting and transfer thereof; a copy of that agreement is on file at the principal office of the company." 7.2 governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly in new york (except to the extent this agreement is ineffective under the corporation law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the company; to that extent, but only

the courts of the united states of america for the southern district of new york (and appellate courts from any thereof) for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
