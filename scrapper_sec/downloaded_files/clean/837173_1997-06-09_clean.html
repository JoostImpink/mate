(a) general principles. the trustees shall promptly proceed to implement the crp. because the terms of the apicrp and the apdcrp differ, payments might not be paid simultaneously to holders of asbestos personal injury claims and pd claims. however, the trustees shall promptly pay both asbestos personal injury claims and pd claims under the terms of both the apicrp and the apdcrp, as applicable, and shall not give preference in timing nor advance or delay payments to either asbestos personal injury claim holders or pd claim holders relative to the other. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the crp, the trustees may accelerate the liquidation and allowance (but not payment) of a claim under the crp where such claimant demonstrates that the claimant has a trial date on a court docket for a trial on claims related to the claimant's asbestos claim. - 9 - 10 closing binder index tab no. _____ (b) asbestos claims. (i) the trustees shall favor settlement over arbitration or other form of alternative dispute resolution, arbitration or other form of alternative dispute resolution over resort to the tort system, and fair and efficient resolution of claims in all cases, while endeavoring to preserve and enhance the trust estate. (ii) the trustees shall employ mechanisms such as the review of estimates of the numbers and values of asbestos claims, or other comparable mechanisms, that provide reasonable assurance the trust will value, and be in a financial position to pay, present asbestos claims and future demands that involve similar claims in substantially the same manner. (iii) the trustees shall administer the processing and payment of asbestos personal injury claims in accordance with the apicrp, as the same may be amended from time to time, in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof. (iv) the trust may elect to prosecute before the bankruptcy court (and all appellate courts) to a final, non-appealable order objections to asbestos claims filed prior to the effective date. between confirmation and the effective date, prosecution of objections to asbestos claims filed between confirmation and the effective date shall be stayed. upon allowance of any part of such asbestos claim by a final, non-appealable order or settlement, the claimant will be paid in accordance with crp. (c) pd claims. the allowance of pd claims shall be administered by the pdca exclusively in accordance with the apdcrp. the trustees shall not interfere with the actions and decisions of the pdca that are consistent with the apdcrp nor shall the trustees interfere with the independence of the pdca in administering the apdcrp. the trustees shall not amend the apdcrp without the consent of the pd advisory committee. payment of pd claims shall be made by the trustees in the amount determined by the pdca pursuant to the apdcrp. 3.4 claims payment. (a) periodic estimates. there is inherent uncertainty regarding celotex's and carey canada's total liabilities to holders of asbestos claims as well as the total value of the trust assets available to pay allowed asbestos claims. consequently, there is inherent uncertainty whether or not similar amounts can be paid in respect of all similar present and future allowed asbestos personal injury claims and of all allowed pd claims. to ensure substantially equivalent treatment, the trustees must determine the percentage of the allowed amount of all present and future asbestos claims that would likely be paid to holders of - 10 - 11 closing binder index tab no. _____ such claims ("payment percentage") prior to making distributions to claimants, other than those who have elected the discounted cash payment described in the crp. the trustees must base this determination, on the one hand, on estimates of the number, types, and amounts of present and expected future asbestos claims and, on the other hand, on the value of the trust assets, the liquidity of those assets, the trust's expected future expenses and income, and other material matters that are reasonable and likely to affect the sufficiency of funds to pay a comparable percentage of full value to all holders of asbestos claims. therefore, after the second anniversary of the effective date, but no less frequently than once every two (2) years, the trustees shall consider their determination of the payment percentage to assure that it is based on credible, current information and forecasts, and may, after such consideration, change the payment percentage. when making these determinations, the trustees shall recognize that both present and future claimants bear a risk that the payment percentage will be incorrect, either too low or too high respectively. in setting the payment percentage, the trustees shall not prefer either present or future claimants by giving greater protection from such risks to either. rather, the trustees shall determine the recalculation of the payment percentage based on their best estimates of total trust assets and asbestos claims. (b) initial payment percentage. during the first two years of operation, the trustees will have difficulty in calculating the payment percentage because of uncertainties in the total number, quality and value of asbestos claims and the actual value of the trust assets. during the first two years following the effective date, while these matters are particularly uncertain, the trust can and shall rely upon the calculation of the initial payment percentage, as described in the plan and use the initial payment percentage in paying (i) prepetition liquidated claims or claims under the individualized review process pursuant to the apicrp and (ii) pd claims liquidated and allowed prior to the effective date which shall be paid within six (6) months of the effective date. if the trustees conclude that use of the initial payment percentage will adversely affect the interests of future claimants or present claimants who have not yet been liquidated and allowed, the trustees shall either suspend payments until they are able to determine an appropriate payment percentage, or exercise their powers as set forth herein and in the crp. during the first two (2) years following the effective date, claims that are liquidated and allowed but as to which payments have been suspended, shall receive when such payments resume, through installments or otherwise, the payment percentage in force at the time of liquidation and allowance. claims that are liquidated and allowed during the first two (2) years following the effective date, but after a decision by the trustees to reduce the initial payment percentage to a new payment percentage, shall receive payments in the future, in installments or otherwise (but for a period no longer than ten (10) years after the date of liquidation and allowance), equal to any increase in the payment percentage, - 11 - 12 closing binder index tab no. _____ but in no event shall such claimant receive more than the initial payment percentage times the allowed amount of such claimant's claim. (c) payment. the trustees shall have complete discretion to determine the timing and the appropriate method for making payments, subject to the requirements of the crp with respect to the processing and ordering of claims for payment. such methods may include, in the discretion of the trustees, a method for the payment on an installment basis, in which case each installment payment shall be subject to the payment percentage in effect at the time such installment payment is made, except that the last installment will be in an amount that would produce a total payment to the claimant equal to the allowed amount of the claim times the payment percentage in effect at the time of such last payment. because of the initial uncertainties about assets and liabilities, during the first two years after the effective date, the trustees shall only pay prepetition claimants electing individualized review under the apicrp and category 1 claimants electing payment deferral under the apdcrp on an installment basis with an initial payment determined by the initial payment percentage in article 1 of the plan times fifty (50%) percent of the allowed amount of the claim. the trust will make a second payment to such claimants after the second anniversary of the effective date, but no later than thirty-six (36) months after the effective date, or after the trustees have considered and, if necessary redetermined, the payment percentage, so that the total amount received by the claimant is equal to the allowed amount times the then current payment percentage. during the first two years after the effective date, the trustees shall only pay non-prepetition claims filed before the bar date electing individualized review under the apicrp and category 2 and category 3 claimants electing payment deferral under the apdcrp on an installment basis with an initial payment determined by the initial payment percentage in article 1 of the plan times fifty (50%) percent of the allowed amount of the claim. the trust will make a second payment to such claimants after the third anniversary of the effective date, but no later than forty-eight (48) months after the effective date, or after the trustees have considered and, if necessary redetermined, the payment percentage, so that the total amount received by the claimant is equal to the allowed amount times the then current payment percentage. (d) auditing, monitoring and verifying. the trustees shall conduct random or other audits to verify information submitted in connection with the crp in a manner consistent with the crp. (e) discretion to alter order of processing or suspend payments. (i) in the event that the trustees determine it is advisable, they may suspend their normal order of processing - 12 - 13 closing binder index tab no. _____ or payment in favor of claimants who elect discounted cash payment under any future discounted cash payment election programs offered by the trust. (ii) in the event that the trust faces temporary periods of limited liquidity or the trustees conclude that use of the current payment percentage will adversely affect the interests of future claimants or present claimants who have not yet been paid, the trustees may temporarily limit or suspend payments altogether. (iii) consistent with the provisions hereof, the trustees and the pdca shall proceed as quickly as possible to liquidate claims, and the trustees shall make payments to holders of allowed asbestos claims promptly as funds become available, while maintaining sufficient resources to pay future allowed asbestos claims in substantially the same manner. because decisions about payments must be based on estimates and cannot be made precisely, such decisions may have to be revised in light of experience over time, and a claimant who receives payment early in the life of the trust may receive a smaller or larger percentage of the allowed amount of such claimant's asbestos claim than a claimant who receives payment in the middle of or late in the life of the trust. therefore, there can be no guarantee of any specific level of payment to claimants. however, the trustees shall use their best efforts to treat similar, allowed asbestos claims in a substantially equivalent manner, consistent with their duties as trustees in these circumstances, the purposes of the trust, and given the practical limitations imposed by the inability to predict the future with precision. article 4 accounts, investments, and payments 4.1 accounts. that trustees may, from time to time, create such accounts and reserves within the trust estate as they may deem necessary, prudent or useful in order to provide for the payment of expenses and valid asbestos claims and may, with respect to any such account or reserve, restrict the use of monies therein. 4.2 investments. investment of monies held in the trust shall be administered in the manner in which individuals of ordinary prudence, discretion and judgment would act in the management of their own affairs, subject to the following limitations and provisions: (a) the trust shall not acquire, directly or indirectly, equity in any person (other than those that are trust assets under the plan and subsidiaries or affiliates of trust - 13 - 14 closing binder index tab no. _____ assets, now or hereafter acquired, or any successor to reorganized celotex) or business enterprise if, immediately following such acquisition, the trust would hold more than 5% of the equity in such person or business enterprise. the trust shall not hold, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the equity in any person (other than a person constituting a trust asset under the plan including reorganized celotex and its subsidiaries or affiliates, now or hereafter acquired, or any successor to reorganized celotex) or business enterprise.

(d) the trust shall not acquire or hold any preferred stock unless such preferred stock is rated "aa" or higher by moody's or "a" or higher by s&p's or has been given an equivalent investment grade rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating agency. (e) the trust shall not acquire any securities or other instruments issued by any person (other than debt securities or other instruments issued or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the united states of america or any agency or instrumentality thereof) if, following such acquisition, the aggregate market value of all securities and instruments issued by such person held by the trust would exceed 2% of the aggregate value of the trust estate. the trust shall not hold any securities or other instruments issued by any person (other than debt securities or other instruments issued or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the united states of america or any agency or instrumentality thereof) to the extent that the aggregate market value of all securities and instruments issued by such person held by the trust would exceed 5% of the aggregate value of the trust estate.

(g) the trust may acquire and hold any securities or instruments issued by reorganized celotex, jim walter company, or walter industries, inc., or their subsidiaries, affiliates, or successors, without regard to the limitations set forth in subsections (a) - (f) above. (h) the trust shall not acquire or hold any repurchase obligations unless, in the opinion of the trustees, they are adequately collateralized. (i) the trust shall not acquire or hold any options. 4.3 source of payments. all trust expenses, payments and all liabilities with respect to asbestos claims shall be payable solely out of the trust estate. neither celotex, reorganized celotex, the debtors, their subsidiaries, any successor in interest or the present or former directors, officers, employees or agents of celotex, reorganized celotex, the debtors or their subsidiaries, nor the trustees, the approving entities or any of their officers, agents, advisors or employees shall be liable for the payment of any trust expense or any other liability of the trust. article 5 trustees 5.1 number. there shall be five (5) trustees designated by the tac and the legal representative. upon the unanimous vote of the tac and with the consent of the legal representative, the number of trustees can be reduced to three (3) trustees. the initial trustees shall be those persons named on the signature page hereof. one (1) trustee shall be designated chairperson annually by vote of the remaining trustees. 5.2 term of service.
