(a) at any time after the expiration of the shelf registration, requisite holders may by written notice to the company request that the company register all or a portion of the registrable shares held by such holders under the securities act and, subject to the provisions of this agreement, the company shall use its best efforts to effect such registration promptly. each notice to the company shall set forth (i) the names of the requisite holders requesting registration ("requesting holders") and the number of shares to be sold by each and (ii) the proposed manner of sale. within ten (10) days after receipt of notice from requisite holders, the company shall notify each holder who is not a party to the written notice served on the company and offer to them the opportunity to include their shares in such registration. each such holder shall have 20 days following delivery of such notice to elect, by notice to the company, to have such holder's registrable shares included in such registration. the company shall have no obligation to effect any demand registration under this section 3 unless the number of registrable shares in such demand registration shall be equal to at least 5% of the number of shares of new common stock outstanding at the time of such request. the maximum number of such demands under this section 3 shall be two (2); provided, however, that no such demand may be made after the eighteenth month following the expiration of the shelf registration. a registration statement will not count as a demand registration hereunder unless it is declared effective by the commission and remains effective for at least ninety (90) days or such shorter period which shall terminate when all of the 4 registrable shares covered by such demand registration have been sold pursuant to such demand registration; provided, however. that in the event a registration statement is withdrawn at the request of the requesting holders (other than a withdrawal pursuant to section 3(c) of this agreement), such requesting holders will pay all registration expenses unless they agree to forfeit such demand registration to which such registration expenses relate. the demand registration rights granted pursuant to this section 3 are in addition to, and shall not limit, the registration rights of the holders of registrable shares these rights are in addition to, and shall not limit, the registration rights of the holders of registrable shares granted pursuant to section 2 or 5 hereunder.

(e) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 3, if the company has effected a shelf registration in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of this agreement, the company may elect to extend such shelf registration for a period of at least eighteen months beyond the three (3) year term required pursuant to section 2 and (i) for so long as such shelf registration remains effective, the company shall have no obligation to effect a demand registration pursuant to this section 3 and (ii) if such shelf registration remains effective for such eighteen month period, the rights of the holders to request registration pursuant to this section 3 shall be terminated and the company shall have no obligation to effect a demand registration. section 4. suspension of effectiveness. the company's obligations under section 2(a) and section 3(a) shall not restrict its ability to suspend the effectiveness of the shelf registration or any demand registration, at any time, for such reasonable period of time which the company believes is necessary to prevent the premature disclosure of any events or information having a material effect on the company. in addition, the company shall not be required to keep the shelf registration or any demand registration, effective, or may, without suspending such effectiveness, instruct the holders of registrable shares included in the shelf registration or any demand registration, not to sell such shares, during any period during which the company is instructed, directed, ordered or otherwise requested by any governmental agency or self-regulatory organization to stop or suspend such trading or sales. section 5. incidental registration rights. (a) if the company, at any time during the period commencing on the effective date and ending on the date that is four years and six months after the date on which the shelf registration becomes effective, proposes to register any new common stock under the securities act (other than pursuant to sections 2 or 3 of this agreement or pursuant to a registration statement on a form exclusively for the sale or distribution of securities by the company to employees of the company or its subsidiaries or for use exclusively in connection with a business combination) whether or not for sale for its own account, and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of registrable shares, it will give prompt written notice to all holders of the company's intention to effect such a registration and include in such registration all registrable shares with respect to which the company has received written notice for inclusion therein within 20 days after the date of the company's notice; provided that: 6 (i) if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any shares and, prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to register such shares, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each holder requesting inclusion therein, and, thereupon, the company shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable shares in connection with such registration (but not of its obligation to pay the registration expenses in connection therewith); and (ii) if such registration shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering and the managing underwriter shall advise the company in writing that in its opinion the number of shares requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number of such securities which can be sold in such offering or would have an adverse impact on the price of such securities, the company shall include in such registration (a) first, the securities the company proposes to sell and, if such registration includes an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the company's securities exercising demand registration rights, the securities requested to be included therein by such holders requesting such registration, in such proportions as the company shall determine, and (b) second, the number (if any) of other securities of the company (including, without limitation, registrable shares) so requested to be included which in the opinion of such underwriter can be sold (and if, in the opinion of such underwriter, some but not all of such securities may be so included, all holders of new common stock requested to be included therein shall share pro rata in the number of shares of new common stock included in such underwritten public offering on the basis of the number of shares of new common stock requested to be included therein); (b) if any registration pursuant to this section 5 is an underwritten primary offering, the company shall have the right to select the managing underwriter to administer such offering. section 6. holdback agreement. (a) in the event of any post-effective amendment to the shelf registration or the filing of a prospectus supplement, as the case may be, or the commencement of an underwritten public distribution of new common stock under a registration statement, whether or not registrable shares are included, each holder agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of new common stock (except as part of such underwritten public distribution), including a sale pursuant to rule 144 or rule 144a under the securities act, during a period designated by the company in a written notice duly given to the holders in accordance with section 11(b), which period shall commence approximately 14 days prior to the effective date of any such post-effective amendment to the shelf registration or filing of such prospectus supplement, as the case may be, or the commencement of such underwritten public distribution of new common stock under a registration statement and shall continue for up to 104 consecutive days. (b) the foregoing provisions shall not apply to any holder to the extent such holder is prohibited by applicable law from agreeing to withhold from sale. 7 section 7. registration procedures. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, in connection with any registration of registrable shares pursuant to this agreement, the company shall, as expeditiously as possible, at its own expense: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on the appropriate form with respect to such registrable shares and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable thereafter; and before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, furnish to each selling holder, copies of such registration statement and such other documents as proposed to be filed (including copies of any document to be incorporated by reference therein), and thereafter furnish to such selling holder such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (including copies of any document to be incorporated by reference therein), in each case at the written request of the selling holder, including all exhibits thereto, the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus), and, promptly after the effectiveness of a registration statement, the definitive final prospectus filed with the commission, and such other documents as such selling holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable shares owned by such selling holder; (b) use its best efforts to register or qualify such registrable shares under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions within the united states as any selling holder reasonably (in light of such selling holder's intended plan of distribution) requests; provided that the company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this section 7(b), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; (c) notify each selling holder of such registrable shares, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the occurrence of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement (including any document to be incorporated by reference therein) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and, at the request of any such selling holder, the company shall prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable shares, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and promptly make available to each selling holder any such supplement or amendment; (d) in connection with an underwritten public offering, enter into customary agreements (including, if requested, an underwriting agreement), reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the company, and take such other actions in connection therewith as the holders of at least a majority of the registrable shares being sold or the underwriter shall reasonably request in order to consummate the disposition of such registrable shares;
