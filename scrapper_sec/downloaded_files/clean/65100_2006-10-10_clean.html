state of new jersey and the new york stock exchange (the &#147;nyse&#148;) and reached an agreement in principle with the state of connecticut pursuant to which merrill lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a settlement that included findings that it failed to maintain certain books and records and to reasonably supervise a team of former financial analysts (&#147;fas&#148;) who facilitated improper market timing by a hedge fund client. merrill lynch terminated the fas in october 2003, brought the matter to the attention of regulators, and cooperated fully in the regulators&#146; review. the settlement will result in aggregate payments of $13.5 million. in march 2005, merrill lynch reached an agreement in principle with the nyse pursuant to which merrill lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations, later consented to a settlement that included findings with regard to certain matters relating to the failure to deliver prospectuses for certain auction rate preferred shares and open-end mutual funds; the failure to deliver product descriptions with regard to certain exchange-traded funds; the failure to ensure that proper registration qualifications were obtained for certain personnel; issues with regard to the retention, retrieval and review of e-mails; isolated lapses in branch office supervision; late reporting of certain events such as customer complaints and arbitrations; the failure to report certain complaints in quarterly reports to the nyse due to a systems error; and partial non-compliance with continuing education requirements. the settlement resulted in a payment of $10 million to the nyse. on november 3, 2004, a jury in houston, texas convicted four former merrill lynch employees of criminal misconduct in connection with a nigerian barge transaction that the government alleged helped enron inflate its 1999 earnings by $12 million. the jury also found that the transaction led to investor losses of $13.7 million. those convictions were reversed by a federal appellate court on august 1, 2006, except for one conviction against one employee based on perjury and obstruction of justice. the government has appealed the reversals. in 2003, merrill lynch agreed to pay $80 million to settle commission charges that it aided and abetted enron&#146;s fraud by engaging in two improper year-end transactions in 1999, including the nigerian barge transaction. the $80 million paid in connection with the settlement with the commission will be made available to settle investor claims. in september 2003, the united states department of justice agreed not to prosecute merrill lynch for crimes that may have been committed by its former employees related to certain transactions with enron, subject to certain understandings, including merrill lynch&#146;s continued cooperation with the department, its acceptance of responsibility for conduct of its former employees, and its agreement to adopt and implement new policies and procedures related to the integrity of client and counter-party financial statements, complex structured finance transactions and year-end transactions. on or about june 27, 2003, the attorney general for the state of west virginia brought an action against the defendants that participated in the april 28, 2003, settlement described below. the action, filed in the west virginia state court, alleged that the defendants&#146; research practices violated the west virginia consumer credit and protection act. on september 16, 2005, the circuit court of marshall county, west virginia, dismissed the case, following an earlier decision by the west virginia supreme court holding that the west virginia attorney general lacked authority to bring the claims. on october 31, 2003, the united states district court for the southern district of new york entered final judgments in connection with alleged conflicts of interest affecting research practices. the final settlements pertaining to merrill lynch, which involved both monetary and non-monetary relief, brought to a conclusion the regulatory actions against merrill lynch related to its research practices. merrill lynch entered into these settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and findings by the regulators, and the settlements did not establish wrongdoing or liability for purposes of any other proceedings. for further information, reference is made to the form adv of merrill lynch on file with, and publicly available on the website of, the
