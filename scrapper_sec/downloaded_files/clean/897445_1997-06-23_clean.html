broadcasting interests. the name, residence or business address, principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business, and address of any corporation or other organization in which such

jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to federal or

file no. 33-45967) filed by the company setting forth the terms and conditions of a public offering (the "offering") of its class b stock was ordered effective. immediately prior to the offering, cbn converted $127,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the company's 6% convertible secured notes due 2004 (the "convertible notes") into 11,430,000 shares of class b stock, 6,666,667 shares of which were sold to the public in the offering by cbn as the selling stockholder, and 4,763,333 shares of which cbn held for its own account. the offering closed on may 5, 1992. on june 30, 1992, pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement, dated as of june 30, 1992 (the "assignment agreement"), between cbn and regent university ("regent") (a copy of which was attached as exhibit 1 to cbn's amendment no. 1 to schedule 13d filed with the commission on july 24, 1992, and is incorporated herein by reference), cbn donated the remaining $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes held by it to regent. the convertible notes were convertible at the option of the holder into shares of class b stock at the rate of 90 shares of class b stock for each $1,000 face amount of convertible notes. the convertible notes donated by cbn to regent were convertible into, and cbn therefore conveyed to regent beneficial ownership of, an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of class b stock. no consideration was paid by regent to cbn for the convertible notes. the convertible notes are more fully described in the "description of capital stock and convertible notes" section of the company's prospectus (the "prospectus"), dated april 28, 1992, with respect to the class b stock, which was filed with the commission on june 12, 1992, as exhibit a to cbn's initial schedule 13d with respect to the class b stock, and is incorporated herein by reference. on november 7, 1992, cbn and the company entered into a waiver agreement dated november 7,1992 (the "waiver agreement"), which was filed with the commission on february 5, 1993 as exhibit a to amendment no. 2 to cbn's schedule 13d with respect to the class b stock. at such time, the company also entered into a waiver agreement with liberty programming corporation ("liberty"), a subsidiary of liberty media corporation. in accordance with the waiver agreement, on april 29, 1993, cbn purchased 1,000,000 shares (the "waiver shares") of class b stock for an aggregate consideration of $10,875,000. cbn borrowed all of the funds to purchase the waiver shares pursuant to a margin loan extended by charles schwab & co., inc., which loan was secured by a margin account containing margin equity securities. this loan has been repaid. as of november 9, 1993, cbn, regent and the company entered into a redemption agreement, which provided that the company would repurchase from regent a portion of the $100,000,000 in principal amount of the convertible notes held by regent (the "regent repurchase"). under the terms of the redemption agreement, a copy of which was filed with the commission on november 26, 1993 as exhibit a to amendment no. 4 to cbn's schedule 13d, and is incorporated herein by reference, the company paid regent $107,500,860 in cash, plus accrued interest as provided in the convertible notes, to the date of repurchase, to repurchase approximately $55,556,000 in principal amount of the convertible notes, and regent converted the remaining portion of its convertible notes into 3,999,960 shares of the class b stock (the "regent conversion"). the portion of the convertible notes that the company repurchased was convertible into 5,000,040 shares of the company's class b stock. the repurchase price equates to an effective price for these shares of $21.50 per share, the average of the closing bid and ask prices for the company's class b stock at the close of trading on the date of the redemption agreement. the regent repurchase closed on december 30, 1993. pursuant to the assignment agreement, regent may not, without the prior written consent of cbn (which may be withheld in cbn's sole discretion), transfer any class b stock into which the convertible notes have been converted. regent and cbn therefore may be deemed to share dispositive power over, and thereby beneficial ownership of, such class b stock. in addition to its beneficial ownership of the shares of class b stock resulting from the regent conversion, cbn holds 3,891,121 shares of class b stock, over which it has sole voting and dispositive power. on november 24, 1993, the company filed a registration statement on form s-3 (the "shelf registration statement") to register 2,000,000 shares of the class b stock held by cbn (1,000,000 shares of which were purchased on april 29, 1993, pursuant to the waiver agreement) and 500,000 shares of class b stock held by the robertson charitable remainder unitrust (the "trust"). the shelf registration statement was declared effective by the commission on december 17, 1993. the shelf registration statement provided that the distribution of the registered shares could be effected from time to time by cbn and the trust directly to purchasers or through one or more broker - dealers, agents, or underwriters, in one or more transactions on the new york stock exchange, or other stock exchanges in which the class b stock was listed pursuant to and in accordance with the rules of such exchanges, in the over the counter market, and in negotiated transactions or otherwise, at fixed prices, prices equal to or related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. cbn elected to register the 2,000,000 shares of class b stock for sale in order to diversify cbn's assets and provide liquidity to further cbn's charitable purposes. on december 23, 1993, cbn sold 1,900,000 registered shares through a broker at a fixed price of $20.25 per share. an additional 25,000 of the registered shares were sold through a broker for $13.50 per share on february7, 1995. the remaining 75,000 registered shares were sold through a broker for $13.125 per share on march 13, 1995. on november 20, 1995 the company announced a 5-for-4 stock split for its class b stock (the "stock split") to be effected in the form of a 25% stock dividend. the shares were distributed on january 5, 1996, to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 15, 1995. as a result of the stock split, cbn received 777,536 shares of class b stock, and regent received 842,865 shares of class b stock. item 4. purpose of the transaction

based upon information provided by the company, as of may 2, 1997, there are 32,781,795 shares of class b stock outstanding. cbn may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 8,105,446 shares of class b

transaction agreements (or any of the agreements related thereto), without the prior written consent of the company (subject 23 to section 6.8, if applicable). notwithstanding the foregoing, fkww and fkw sub may effect any modification to the other transaction agreements (or any of the agreements related thereto) which they determine in good faith to be reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated thereby, provided they use their reasonable good faith efforts to cause the closing thereunder to occur as soon as practicable and provided further that such modification will not delay the effective time beyond november 30, 1997. 6.5 notification of certain matters. the company shall use reasonable good faith efforts to promptly give written notice to fkww and fkw sub, and fkww and fkw sub shall use reasonable good faith efforts to promptly give written notice to the company, upon becoming aware of the occurrence or, to its knowledge, impending or threatened occurrence, of any event which would cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained or referenced in this agreement and use its reasonable good faith efforts to prevent or promptly remedy the same. 6.6 access and information. from the date hereof to the effective time, the company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents to, afford the officers, employees and agents of fkww and fkw sub and their respective affiliates reasonable access during normal business hours (or at such other times as fkww or fkw sub and the company may mutually agree) to its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and shall furnish fkww and fkw sub and their respective affiliates all financial, operating and other data and information as fkww or fkw sub or any of their respective affiliates, through their respective officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request. all information disclosed pursuant to this section 6.6, shall be subject to those certain confidentiality agreements entered into by and between fkww and the company as of may 2, 1996, december 17, 1996, and december 31, 1996 (the "confidentiality agreements"). 6.7 acquisition proposals. prior to the effective time, the company agrees (a) that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) to initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with respect to a merger, acquisition, consolidation or similar transaction involving, or any purchase of all or any significant portion of the assets or any equity securities of, the company or any of its subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "acquisition proposal") or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to an acquisition proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an acquisition proposal; (b) that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and will take the necessary steps to inform the individuals or entities referred to above of the obligations undertaken in this section 6.7; and (c) that it will notify fkww and fkw sub immediately if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any such information is received from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, it; provided, 24 however, that nothing contained in this section 6.7 shall prohibit the board of directors of the company from (i) furnishing information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited bona fide proposal to acquire the company pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, purchase of a substantial portion of the assets, business combination or other similar transaction, if, and only to the extent that (a) the board of directors determines in good faith, based as to legal matters on advice of outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would involve a substantial risk of breach of fiduciary duty to the company's shareholders imposed by applicable law, (b) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity, the company provides notice to fkww and fkw sub to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity, and (c) subject to any confidentiality agreement with such person or entity (which the company executed after determining in good faith, based as to legal matters on advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would involve a substantial risk of breach of the board of directors' fiduciary duty to stockholders imposed by applicable law), the company keeps fkww and fkw sub informed of the status (not the terms) of any such discussions or negotiations; and (ii) to the extent applicable, complying with rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the exchange act with regard to an acquisition proposal. nothing in this section 6.7 shall (x) permit any party to terminate this agreement (except as specifically provided in section 8.1 hereof), (y) permit any party to enter into any agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal during the term of this agreement (it being agreed that during the term of this agreement, no party shall enter into any agreement with any person that provides for, or in any way facilitates, an acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in customary form)), or (z) affect any other obligation of any party under this agreement. 6.8 board of directors. in the event fkww and the other parties thereto consummate the purchase of the company stock from the robertson sellers pursuant to the robertson purchase agreement prior to the closing of the merger, fkww shall, from and after such closing, be entitled to designate, at its option, upon notice to the company, up to that number of directors, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the company's board of directors, subject to compliance with section 14(f) of the exchange act, as will make the percentage of the company's directors designated by fkww equal to the aggregate voting power of the shares of company stock held by fkww or any of its subsidiaries (after giving effect to the conversion of the class a stock to class b stock and the conversion of any class c stock and any convertible notes then held by fkww or its subsidiaries into class b stock); provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated and need not appoint any designee or designees to the board of directors of the company who, in the board's good faith judgment, are not fit to be directors of the company; and provided, further, that in the event that fkww designees are elected to the board of directors of the company, such board of directors shall have, until the effective time, at least two directors who are class b directors on the date of this agreement (the "continuing directors"), and provided, further that, in such event, if the number of continuing directors shall be reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining continuing directors shall be permitted to designate an individual to fill such vacancy who would be an "independent director" under the rules of the new york stock exchange (such designee to be deemed to be a continuing director for purposes of this agreement) or, if no continuing directors then remain, the other directors shall designate two individuals to fill such 25 vacancies who shall not be officers, directors, employees or affiliates of fkww or any of its affiliates and shall otherwise be "independent directors" under the rules of the new york stock exchange (each designee to be deemed to be a continuing director for purposes of this agreement). to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the company shall take all actions requested by fkww which are reasonably necessary to effect the election of any such designee or designees, including the inclusion in the information statement, or a separate mailing, of the information required by section 14(f) of the exchange act and rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the making of such mailing as part of the information statement or otherwise, as requested by fkww (provided that fkww shall have provided to the company on a timely basis all information required to be included with respect to fkww designees). in connection with the foregoing, the company will promptly either increase the size of the company's board of directors and/or obtain the resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary to enable fkww designees to be elected or appointed to the company's board of directors as provided above. following the election or appointment of fkww's designees pursuant to this section 6.8 and prior to the effective time, any amendment, or waiver of any term or condition, of this agreement or the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or restated by-laws of the company, any termination of this agreement by the company, any extension by the company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of fkww or fkw sub or waiver or assertion of any of the company's rights hereunder, or any other consents or actions by the board of directors with respect to this agreement or the guaranty, will require, and will require only, the concurrence of a majority of the continuing directors, except to the extent that applicable law requires that such action be acted upon by the full board of directors, in which case such action will require the concurrence of a majority of the directors, which majority shall include each of the continuing directors, and no other action by the company shall be required for purposes of this agreement. after the date of this agreement, until the earlier of (i) the effective time, and (ii) the termination of this agreement, fkww will not exercise any rights it may have as a stockholder of the company to effect a change in the composition of the board of directors of the company, except as provided for in this section 6.8. 6.9 indemnification and insurance. fkww shall cause all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the past and present directors or officers of the company as provided in the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation or restated by-laws with respect to claims arising from service as officers or directors prior to the effective time to survive the merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the effective time (or with respect to claims arising from service as officers or directors prior to the effective time which have not been resolved prior to such sixth anniversary, until the time such matters are finally resolved). fkww shall cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect for not less than six years from the effective time the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the company as of the date hereof (provided that the surviving corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same amount of coverage (covering known or unknown claims as of the effective time) containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous), copies of which has been previously made available to fkww, with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time, to the extent available; provided, however, that the surviving corporation shall not be required to maintain such insurance to the extent the annual premium 26 therefor exceeds 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the company in respect of the current policy or policies (the "maximum amount") but in such case shall purchase as much comparable coverage as available for the maximum amount. 6.10 officer's certificate. the company, at the request of fkww, shall deliver a certificate to fkww executed by an executive officer of the company in the form and with respect to the matters referred to in the attached exhibit a, dated as of the date of the closing of the purchase of the control stock (as defined in the robertson purchase agreement) by fkww pursuant to terms of the robertson purchase agreement, or, alternatively, inform fkww that it is unable to give such certificate because of the inaccuracy of any of the matters referred to therein. article vii conditions 7.1 conditions to obligation of each party to effect the merger. the respective obligations of each party to effect the merger shall be subject to the fulfillment or waiver at or prior to the effective time of the

shall not have been any statute, rule, regulation or order promulgated, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the merger by any governmental entity or court of competent jurisdiction which would make the consummation of the merger illegal; provided, however, that upon the closing of the purchase of the control stock pursuant to the robertson purchase agreement, the conditions in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this section 7.1 above shall, to the extent then applicable, no longer be applicable. 27 7.2 additional conditions to the company's obligation to effect the merger. the obligation of

reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (b) the company shall have performed in all material respects its obligations hereunder required to be performed on or before the effective time, and (c) except as set forth in the company disclosure letter or as expressly

applicable, set forth in sections 7.1 or 7.2, or (d) by the company, if after the date hereof and before the effective time, the guarantor attempts or purports to revoke or withdraw the guaranty or a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines that the guaranty is unenforceable or invalid; provided that any action by the company shall be subject to section 6.8 if then applicable; and provided, further, that the november 30, 1997 date shall be extended for (i) any period that a party is subject to a non-final order, injunction or decree prohibiting consummation of the merger and
