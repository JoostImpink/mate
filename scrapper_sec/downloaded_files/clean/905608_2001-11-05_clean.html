registrations on form s-3 for the holders pursuant to this section 1.5; if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the company stating that in

and accountants for the company, any underwriter, any other holder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the 1933 act, the 1934 act or any other federal or state securities law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based on any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will reimburse any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this section 1.9(b), for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided that the indemnity agreement in this section 1.9(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided further that in no event shall any indemnity by such holder under this section 1.9(b), when aggregated with amounts contributed, if any, pursuant to section 1.9(d), exceed the net proceeds from the sale of registrable securities hereunder received by such holder. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 1.9 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 1.9, deliver to the indemnifying party notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent that the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to notify the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 1.9, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 1.9. if the indemnification provided in this section 1.9 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that shall have resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided that in no event shall any contribution by a holder under this section 1.9(d), when aggregate with amounts paid, if any, pursuant to section 1.9(b), exceed the net proceeds from the sale of registrable securities hereunder received by such holder. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. the obligations of the company and holders under this section 1.9 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement under this section 1, and otherwise. reports under 1934 act . with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 act and any other rule or regulation of the sec that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration statement (including, without limitation, form s-3), the company agrees to: make and keep public information available, as those terms are used in sec rule 144, at all times; take such action as is necessary to enable the holders to utilize form s-3 for the sale of their registrable securities; file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the 1933 act and the 1934 act; and furnish to any holder, so long as the

act, or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to form s-3, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company and such other reports and

company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, notified of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the registrable securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned; (b) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement; (c) such assignment shall be effective only if

registration statement effected pursuant to this agreement. limitations on subsequent registration rights . for a period of one year after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without

and will not grant any registration rights that diminish or adversely affect the registration rights of the holders hereunder (including, without limitation, reducing the number of registrable securities that are to be included in any registration or proposed registration filed under the terms hereof), unless (i) the prospective holder or holders purchase in excess of $10,000,000 worth of securities from the company and (ii) under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder shall have been granted rights to require the company to register such securities under terms

company will forthwith take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of common stock to such number as will be sufficient for such purposes. the company will obtain authorization, consent, approval or other action by, or make any filing with, any administrative body that may be required under applicable state securities laws in connection with the
