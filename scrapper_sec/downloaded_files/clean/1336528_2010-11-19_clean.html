regulatory or stockholder approvals and (2) the company or the company board determines in good faith that any delay in completion of an offering in respect of which such member of the purchaser group is entitled to subscription rights would materially impair the financing objective of such offering, the company may proceed with such offering without the participation of such member of the purchaser group in such offering, in which event the company and such member of the purchaser group shall promptly thereafter agree on a process otherwise consistent with this section 5.9 as would allow such member of the purchaser group to purchase, at the same price (net of any underwriting discounts or sales commissions or any other discounts or fees if not purchasing from or through an

discounts or fees if not purchasing from or through an underwriter, placement agent or broker) as in such offering, up to the amount of shares of new common stock (or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, or linked to the performance of, new common stock) as shall be necessary to enable the purchaser group to maintain its aggregate proportionate new common stock-equivalent interest in the company on a fully diluted basis and (c) in the event the company is unable to issue shares of new common stock (or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, or linked to the performance of, new common stock) to the applicable members of the purchaser group as a result of a failure to receive regulatory or stockholder approval therefor, the company shall take such action or cause to be taken such other action in order to place the purchaser group, insofar as reasonably practicable (subject to any limitations that may be imposed by applicable law or stock exchange rules), in the same position in all material respects as if the applicable member of the purchaser group was able to effectively exercise its subscription rights hereunder, including, without limitation, at the option of such member, issuing to such member of the purchaser group another class of securities of the company having terms to be agreed by the company and such member having a value at least equal to the value per share of new common stock, in each case, as shall be necessary to enable the purchaser group to maintain its

(c) the company shall deliver to each purchaser a draft of the conclusive net debt adjustment statement no later than 15 calendar days prior to the effective date. each purchaser shall be afforded an opportunity to review the conclusive net debt adjustment statement and reasonable access to all non-privileged and non-work product documents or records or personnel used in the preparation of such statement. on or prior to close of business on the 7th calendar day following receipt of the conclusive net debt adjustment statement, any purchaser may deliver to the company a notice (the &#147; cndas dispute notice &#148;) listing those items to which such purchaser takes exception, which cndas dispute notice shall (i) specifically identify such items, and provide a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis upon which such purchaser has delivered such list, (ii) set forth the alternative amounts that such purchaser has calculated based on the information contained in the conclusive net debt adjustment statement, and (iii) specifically identify such purchaser&#146;s proposed adjustment(s). if a purchaser timely provides the company with a cndas dispute notice, then such purchaser and the company shall attempt to resolve the items specified in the cndas dispute notice (the &#147; cndas disputed items &#148;) consensually. if such purchaser and the company do not resolve all cndas disputed items prior to the effective date, then for purposes of closing and subject to subsequent adjustment consistent with the bankruptcy court&#146;s ruling, the highest number shall be used for purposes of any calculations set forth on the conclusive net debt adjustment statement. within 10 days after closing, the company shall file a motion for resolution by the bankruptcy court. the purchasers and the company agree to seek expedited consideration of any such dispute. the dispute submitted to the bankruptcy court shall be limited to only those cndas disputed items that a purchaser, on the one hand, and the company, on the other hand, were unable to resolve. all other matters shall be deemed to have been agreed upon by the purchasers and the company. if a purchaser does not timely deliver a cndas dispute notice, then such purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the conclusive net debt adjustment statement and to have waived any right to dispute the matters set forth therein. to the extent that one or more cndas disputed items must be submitted to the bankruptcy court for adjudication, the purchasers and the company agree that this should not delay the effective date or the closing date. following adjudication of the dispute, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the conclusive net debt adjustment statement, the ggo promissory note and the other applicable documentation to put all parties in the same economic position as if the corrected conclusive net debt adjustment statement governed at closing. 50 (d) it is the intention of the parties that any reserve should not alter the intended allocation of value between ggo and the company as claims are resolved over time. accordingly, the plan shall provide that, if a ggo promissory note is required to be issued at closing and there is a reserve surplus amount as of the end of any fiscal quarter prior to the maturity of the ggo promissory note, then the principal amount of the ggo promissory note shall be reduced, but not below zero, by (i) if and to the extent that such reserve surplus amount as of such date is less than or equal to the net debt surplus amount, 80% of the reserve surplus amount, and otherwise (ii) 100% of an amount equal to the reserve surplus amount; provided, however, that because this calculation may be undertaken on a periodic basis, for purposes of clauses (i) and (ii), no portion of the reserve surplus amount shall be utilized to reduce the amount of the ggo promissory note if it has been previously utilized for such purpose. in the event that any party requests an equitable adjustment to this formula, the other parties shall consider the request in good faith. (e) the plan shall provide that, if there is an offering premium, the principal amount of the ggo promissory note shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 80% of the aggregate offering premium on the 30th day following the effective date and from time to time thereafter upon receipt of offering premium until the last to occur of (x) 45 days after the effective date, (y) the settlement date, if applicable, and (z) the bridge note maturity date, if applicable.

adjusted cdnd &#148;) and the ggo note amount and indemnity cap (as defined in the tax matters agreement) shall be re-calculated as if the adjusted cdnd was used in the calculations for the effective date. to the extent that a ggo promissory note was issued at closing, then, in order to place ggo and the company in the same economic position as they would have been had the actual amount of such settlement and/or allowance been used for purposes of calculating the ggo note amount, the principal amount of such ggo promissory note will be reduced based on the new calculation using the adjusted cdnd and, to the extent applicable, any interest payments made by ggo to the company on the ggo promissory note prior to such re-calculation shall be refunded in respect of such reductions and accrued but unpaid interest in respect of such reductions shall be eliminated. similarly, in order to place ggo and the company in the same economic position as they would have been had the actual amount of such settlement and/or allowance been used for purposes of calculating the indemnity cap, the indemnity cap shall be re-calculated and adjusted to reflect determination of the net debt surplus amount or net debt excess amount using the adjusted cdnd. additionally, to the extent any promissory note was issued by ggo in favor of the company pursuant to section 5.16(g) , then, in order to place ggo and the company in the same economic position as they would have been had the actual amount of such settlement and/or allowance been used for purposes of calculating such note, (i) the principal amount of such note will be reduced based on the new calculation using the adjusted cdnd and (ii) to the extent applicable, any interest payments made by ggo to the company on such note prior to such re-calculation shall be refunded in respect of such reductions and accrued but unpaid interest in respect of such reductions shall be eliminated. consistent with the foregoing, the tax matters agreement shall be retroactively applied using the re-calculated indemnity cap and any resulting amounts payable thereunder shall be promptly paid. in the event that a bankruptcy court order allowing, disallowing, or reducing and allowing any of the contingent and disputed debt claims is appealed, vacated or otherwise modified, then following entry of a final and nonappealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction determining the amount (if any) of the applicable contingent and disputed debt claim, the adjustment process set forth in the preceding paragraph shall be undertaken within ten (10) calendar days following such order becoming final and nonappealable. 52 (i) solely for purposes of calculating whether a ggo promissory note is required to be issued at closing pursuant to this agreement, $1,000,000 shall be added to ggo setup costs. if a ggo promissory note is issued at closing pursuant to this agreement, then on the six-month anniversary of the closing date (the &#147; calculation date &#148;), (a) the then outstanding principal amount of the ggo promissory note shall be reduced (but not to a number less than zero) by an amount equal to the excess (if it is a positive number), if any, of $1,000,000 over the aggregate amount of cash costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the company after the closing date and prior to the calculation date to transfer assets after closing to ggo pursuant to section 2.4(d) of the separation agreement to be entered into between the company and ggo at or prior to closing, and (b) if the principal amount of the ggo promissory note is reduced pursuant to clause (a), any interest payments made by ggo to the company on the ggo promissory note prior to such reduction pursuant to clause (a) shall be refunded in respect of such reductions and accrued but unpaid interest in respect of such reduction shall be eliminated. section 5.17 determination of domestically controlled reit status .

(ii) notice . in the event thhc proposes to offer proposed securities, it shall give each purchaser written notice of its intention, describing the estimated price (or range of prices), anticipated amount of securities, timing and other terms upon which thhc proposes to offer the same (including, in the case of a registered public offering and to the extent possible, a copy of the prospectus included in the registration statement filed with respect to such offering), no later than ten (10) business days after the commencement of marketing with respect to such offering or after thhc takes substantial steps to pursue any other offering. the applicable member of the purchaser group shall have three (3) business days from the date of receipt of such a notice to notify thhc in writing that it intends to exercise the applicable subscription right and as to the amount of proposed securities such member of the purchaser group desires to purchase, up to the maximum amount calculated pursuant to section 1(i) . in connection with an underwritten public offering, such notice shall constitute a non-binding indication of interest to purchase proposed securities at such a range of prices as such member of the purchaser group may specify and, with respect to other offerings, such notice shall constitute a binding commitment of the applicable member of such purchaser group to purchase the amount of proposed securities so specified at the price and other terms set forth in thhc&#146;s notice to each purchaser. the failure of such member of the purchaser group to so respond within such three (3) business day period shall be deemed to be a waiver of the applicable subscription right under this section 1 only with respect to the offering described in the applicable notice. in connection with an underwritten public offering or a private placement, the applicable member of the purchaser group shall further enter into an agreement (in form and substance customary for transactions of this type) to purchase the proposed securities to be acquired contemporaneously with the execution of any underwriting agreement or purchase agreement entered into with thhc, the underwriters or initial purchasers of such underwritten public offering or private placement, and the failure of such member of the purchaser group to enter into such an agreement at or prior to such time shall constitute a waiver of the subscription right in respect of such offering. 3 (iii) purchase mechanism . if a member of the purchaser group exercises its subscription right provided in this section 1 , the closing of the purchase of the proposed securities with respect to which such right has been exercised shall take place concurrently with the sale to the other investors in the applicable offering, which period of time for the closing of the purchase of the proposed securities with respect to which such right has been exercised shall be extended for a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) days in order to comply with applicable laws (including receipt of any applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals). each of thhc and the applicable member of the purchaser group shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure any regulatory or stockholder approvals or other consents, and to comply with any law necessary in connection with the offer, sale and purchase of, such proposed securities. (iv) failure of purchase . in the event (a) the applicable member of the purchaser group fails to exercise its subscription right provided in this section 1 within said three (3) business day period, or (b) if so exercised, such member of the purchaser group fails or is unable to consummate such purchase within the one hundred eighty (180) day period specified in section 1(iii) , without prejudice to other remedies, thhc shall thereafter be entitled during the additional sale period to sell the proposed securities not elected to be purchased pursuant to this section 1 or which the applicable member of the purchaser group fails to, or is unable to, purchase, at a price and upon terms no more favorable in any material respect to the purchasers of such securities than were specified in thhc&#146;s notice to each purchaser. in the event thhc has not sold the proposed securities within the additional sale period, thhc shall not thereafter offer, issue or sell such proposed securities without first offering such securities to the members of the purchaser group in the manner provided above. (v) non-cash consideration . in the case of the offering of securities for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, including securities acquired in exchange therefor (other than securities by their terms so exchangeable), the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the board of directors of thhc (the &#147; board &#148;); provided , however , that such fair value as determined by the board shall not exceed the aggregate market price of the securities being offered as of the date the board authorizes the offering of such securities. (vi) cooperation . thhc and each applicable member of the purchaser group shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate the exercise of such member of the purchaser group&#146;s subscription right hereunder, including using reasonable efforts to secure any required approvals or consents. (vii) allocation among purchaser group . pscm shall have the right as attorney-in-fact of each member of the purchaser group to exercise all of the rights of the members of the purchaser group hereunder and designate the members of such purchaser group to receive any securities to be issued and thhc may rely on any designations made by pscm. as a condition to the thhc&#146;s obligations with respect to the exercise of a subscription right by a member of the purchaser group not a party to this agreement, such member will agree to perform each obligation applicable to it under this section 1 . 4 (viii) general . notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) if (1) a member of the purchaser group exercises its subscription right pursuant to this section 1 and is unable to complete the purchase of the proposed securities concurrently with the sales to the other investors in the applicable offering as contemplated by section 1(iii) due to applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals and (2) thhc or the board determines in good faith that any delay in completion of an offering in respect of which such member of the purchaser group is entitled to subscription rights would materially impair the financing objective of such offering, thhc may proceed with such offering without the participation of such member of the purchaser group in such offering, in which event thhc and such member of the purchaser group shall promptly thereafter agree on a process otherwise consistent with this section 1 as would allow such member of the purchaser group to purchase, at the same price (net of any underwriting discounts or sales commissions or any other discounts or fees if not purchasing from or through an underwriter, placement agent or broker) as in such offering, up to the amount of shares of ggo common stock (or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, or linked to the performance of, ggo common stock) as shall be necessary to enable the purchaser group to maintain its aggregate proportionate ggo common stock-equivalent interest in thhc on a fully diluted basis, (b) if thhc or the board determines in good faith that compliance with the notice provisions in section 1(ii) would materially impair the financing objective of an offering in respect of which the members of the purchaser group are entitled to subscription rights, thhc shall be permitted by notice to each purchaser to reduce the notice period required under section 1(ii) (but not to less than one (1) business day) to the minimum extent required to meet the financing objective of such offering, and the members of the purchaser group shall have the right to either (x) exercise their subscription rights during the shortened notice periods specified in such notice or (y) require thhc to promptly thereafter agree on a process otherwise consistent with this section 1 as would allow the applicable members of the purchaser group to purchase, at the same price (net of any underwriting discounts or sales commissions or any other discounts or fees if not purchasing from or through an underwriter, placement agent or broker) as in such offering, up to the amount of shares of ggo common stock (or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, or linked to the performance of, ggo common stock) as shall be necessary to enable the purchaser group to maintain its aggregate proportionate ggo common stock-equivalent interest in thhc on a fully diluted basis and (c) in the event thhc is unable to issue shares of ggo common stock (or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, or linked to the performance of, ggo common stock) to the applicable members of the purchaser group as a result of a failure to receive regulatory or stockholder approval therefor, thhc shall take such action or cause to be taken such other action in order to place the purchaser group, in so far as reasonably practicable (subject to any limitations that may be imposed by applicable law or stock exchange rules), in the same position in all material respects as if the applicable member of the purchaser group was able to effectively exercise its subscription rights hereunder, including, without limitation, at the option of such member, issuing to such member of the purchaser group another class of securities of thhc having terms to be agreed by thhc and such member having a value at least equal to the value per share of ggo common stock, in each case, as shall be necessary to enable the purchaser group to maintain its aggregate proportionate ggo common stock-equivalent interest in thhc on a fully diluted basis. 5 (ix) termination . this section 1 shall terminate at such time as the purchaser group collectively beneficially own less than 5% of the outstanding shares of ggo common stock on a fully diluted basis. 2. board of directors .

(iii) subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules, there shall be proportional representation by purchaser ggo board designees on any committee of the ggo board, except for special committees established for potential conflict of interest situations, and except that only purchaser ggo board designees who qualify under the applicable rules of the applicable stock exchange or the sec may serve on committees where such qualification is required. if at any time the number of purchaser ggo board designees serving on the ggo board exceeds the number of purchaser ggo board designees that pscm is then otherwise entitled to designate as a result of a decrease in the percentage of shares of ggo common stock beneficially owned by the purchaser group, such purchaser group shall, to the extent it is within such purchaser group&#146;s control, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such additional purchaser ggo board designees to offer to resign such that the number of purchaser ggo board designees serving on the ggo board after giving effect to such resignation does not exceed the number of purchaser ggo board designees that pscm is entitled to designate for election to the ggo board. 6 (iv) except with respect to the resignation of a purchaser ggo board designee pursuant to section 2(iii) , (a) pscm shall have the power to designate a purchaser ggo board designee&#146;s replacement upon the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office of such purchaser ggo board designee and (b) the board shall promptly take all action reasonably required to fill any vacancy resulting therefrom with such replacement purchaser ggo board designee (including nominating such person, subject to applicable law, as thhc&#146;s nominee to serve on the board and causing thhc to use all reasonable efforts to have such person elected as a director of thhc and solicit proxies for such person to the same extent as it does for any of thhc&#146;s other nominees to the board). (v) (a) each purchaser ggo board designee shall be entitled to the same compensation and same indemnification in connection with his or her role as a director as the members of the board, and each purchaser ggo board designee shall be entitled to reimbursement for documented, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the board or any committees thereof, to the same extent as other members of the board, (b) thhc shall notify each purchaser ggo board designee of all regular and special meetings of the board and shall notify each purchaser ggo board designee of all regular and special meetings of any committee of the board of which such purchaser ggo board designee is a member, and (c) thhc shall provide each purchaser ggo board designee with copies of all notices, minutes, consents and other materials provided to all other members of the board concurrently as such materials are provided to the other members (except, for the avoidance of doubt, as are provided to members of committees of which such purchaser ggo board designee is not a member).

quotient of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such time of effectiveness divided by (y) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the time of effectiveness of and after giving effect to such subdivision or combination. in any such event referred to in this section 5.1 , the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each warrant as in effect immediately prior to the exercise price adjustment contemplated by the foregoing shall be adjusted immediately thereafter to the amount determined by multiplying such number by the quotient of (x) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such exercise price adjustment divided by (y) the exercise price determined in accordance with such exercise price adjustment. 5.2 other dividends and distributions . if at any time or from time to time prior to the exercise of any warrant the company shall fix a record date for the making of a dividend or other distribution (other than (i) as contemplated by section 5.5 , (ii) a stock dividend covered by section 5.1 or (iii) a distribution of rights or warrants covered by section 5.3 ), to the holders of its common stock (collectively, a &#147; distribution &#148;) of: (a) any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of its capital stock or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including cash); or (b) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any of the following: any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of its capital stock or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever; then, in each such case, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such record date shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying such exercise price by the quotient of (x) the fair market value of the common stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the principal national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed or admitted to trading without the right to receive such distribution, minus the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of the securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of common stock divided by (y) the fair market value of the common stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the principal national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed or admitted to trading without the right to receive such distribution; such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. in such event, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant as in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such record date shall be increased immediately thereafter to the amount determined by multiplying such number by the quotient of (x) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence divided by (y) the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. if the distribution includes common stock as well as other items of the sort referred to in section 5.2(a) or (b) , then instead of 15 adjusting for the entire distribution under this section 5.2 the common stock portion shall be treated as a stock dividend that triggers an adjustment to the exercise price and number of shares of common stock obtainable upon exercise of each warrant under section 5.1 and the other items in the distribution shall trigger a further adjustment to such adjusted exercise price and number of shares under this section 5.2 . in the event that such distribution is not so made, the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each warrant then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the board determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the exercise price that would then be in effect and the number of shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of this warrant if such record date had not been fixed. 5.3 rights offerings . if at any time the company shall distribute rights or warrants to all or substantially all holders of its common stock entitling them, for a period of not more than 45 days, to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the fair market value of the common stock on the last trading day preceding the date on which the board declares such distribution of rights or warrants, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying such exercise price by the quotient of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such fair market value divided by (y) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase. in such event, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant as in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such record date shall be increased immediately thereafter to the amount determined by multiplying such number by the quotient of (x) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence divided by (y) the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. in case any rights or warrants referred to in this section 5.3 in respect of which an adjustment shall have been made shall expire unexercised and any shares that would have been underlying such rights or warrants shall not have been allocated pursuant to any backstop commitment or any similar arrangement, the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each warrant then in effect shall be readjusted at the time of such expiration to the exercise price that would then be in effect and the number of shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of each warrant if no adjustment had been made on account of such expired rights or warrants. 5.4 issuer tender or exchange offers . if the company or any subsidiary of the company shall consummate a tender or exchange offer for all or any portion of the common stock for a consideration per share with a fair market value greater than the fair market value of the common stock on the date such tender or exchange offer is first publicly announced (the &#147; announcement date &#148;), the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the expiration date for such tender or exchange offer shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying such exercise price by the quotient of (x) the fair market value of the common stock on the announcement date minus the premium per post-tender share divided by (y) the fair market value of the common stock on the announcement date. in such event, the number 16 of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant as in effect immediately prior to such expiration date shall be increased immediately thereafter to the amount determined by multiplying such number by the quotient of (x) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence divided by (y) the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. as used in this section 5.4 with respect to any tender or exchange offer, &#147; premium per post-tender share &#148; means the quotient of (x) the amount by which the aggregate fair market value of the consideration paid in such tender or exchange offer exceeds the aggregate fair market value on the announcement date of the shares of common stock purchased therein divided by (y) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the expiration date for such tender or exchange offer (after giving pro forma effect to the purchase of shares being purchased in the tender or exchange offer). 5.5 reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale . any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the company&#146;s assets or other transaction, which in each case is effected in such a way that the shares of common stock are converted into the right to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities, other equity interests or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for shares of common stock is referred to herein as &#147; organic change .&#148; prior to the consummation of any organic change, the company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that each of the holders shall thereafter have the right to acquire and receive, in lieu of or in addition to (as the case may be) the common stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of such holder&#146;s warrants, (x) in the case of a mixed consideration merger, the public stock issued in such mixed consideration merger and (y) in the case of any other organic change, such stock, securities, other equity interests or assets, in each case as may be issued or payable in connection with the organic change with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of common stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon exercise of such holder&#146;s warrants, for an aggregate exercise price per warrant equal to (i) in the case of a mixed consideration merger, the aggregate exercise price per warrant as in effect immediately prior to such mixed consideration merger times the stock consideration ratio and (ii) in the case of any other organic change, the aggregate exercise price per warrant as in effect immediately prior to such organic change. in any such case, the company shall make appropriate provision to insure that all of the provisions of the warrants shall thereafter be applicable to such stock, securities, other equity interests or assets. the company shall not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of the company&#146;s assets where the warrants will be assumed by the successor entity, unless prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the company) resulting from consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets assumes by written instrument the obligation to deliver to each such holder upon exercise of any warrant, such stock, securities, equity interests or assets (including cash) as, in accordance with article 5 , such holder may be entitled to acquire. this section 5.5 shall not apply to any warrants or common stock redeemed or sold in connection with any organic change pursuant to section 6.1 , section 6.2(b) , section 6.3(a)(i) and section 6.3(b) , provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the adjustments set forth in this section 5.5 shall be applicable to any warrants that remain outstanding pursuant to this agreement in connection with a public stock merger or mixed consideration merger (including any adjustment applicable in connection with such public stock merger or mixed consideration merger). 17 5.6 other adjustments . the board shall make appropriate adjustments to the amount of cash or number of shares of common stock, as the case may be, due upon exercise of the warrants, as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this article 5 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in its reasonable good faith judgment, in each case to account for any adjustment to the exercise price and the number of shares purchasable on exercise of warrants for the relevant warrant certificate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the exercise price and the number of shares purchasable on exercise of warrants for the relevant warrant certificate where the record date or effective date (in the case of a subdivision or combination of the common stock) of the event occurs, during the period beginning on, and including, the exercise date and ending on, and including, the related settlement date. 5.7 notice of adjustment . whenever the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant is adjusted, as herein provided, the company shall cause the warrant agent promptly to mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder notice of such adjustment or adjustments and shall promptly deliver to the warrant agent a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants selected by the board (who may be the regular accountants employed by the company) setting forth the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement in reasonable detail of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made. the warrant agent shall be fully protected in relying on such certificate, and on any adjustment contained therein, and shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate, and shall be under no duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate, except to exhibit the same from time to time, to any holder desiring an inspection thereof during reasonable business hours. the warrant agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holders to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the number of shares of common stock or other stock or property issuable on exercise of the warrants, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making such adjustment or the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of common stock or other stock or property which may be issuable on exercise of the warrants, or to investigate or confirm whether the information contained in the above referenced certificate complies with the terms of this agreement or any other document. the warrant agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the company to make any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of common stock or security instruments or other securities or properties upon the exercise of any warrant. 6. change of control. 6.1 redemption in connection with a change of control event . upon the occurrence of a change of control event

fifth (5th) business day following the effectiveness of the change of control event. the &#147; cash redemption value &#148; for any warrant will equal the fair value of the warrant as of the date of

connection with any transfer involved in the issue of any warrants, certificate for shares of common stock or other securities underlying the warrants or payment of cash to any person other than the holder of a warrant certificate surrendered upon the exercise or purchase of a warrant, and in case of such transfer or payment, the warrant agent and the company shall not be required to issue any security or to pay any cash until such tax or charge has been paid or it has been established to the warrant agent&#146;s and the company&#146;s satisfaction that no such tax or other charge is due.

bona fide purchaser, the company shall execute and upon its written request the warrant agent shall countersign and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated warrant certificate or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen warrant certificate, a new warrant certificate of like tenor and for a like aggregate number of warrants. upon the issuance of any new warrant certificate under this

reasonable fees and expenses of the warrant agent and of counsel to the company) in connection therewith. every new warrant certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this section 12.4 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen warrant certificate shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen warrant certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other warrant certificates of like tenor properly completed and duly

of all legends with respect to warrants or shares of common stock deposited with dtc from time to time in anticipation of sale in accordance with the volume limitations and other limitations under rule 144, subject to the company&#146;s approval of appropriate procedures, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. following the time at which any such legend is no longer required (as provided above) for certain warrants or shares of common stock, the company shall promptly, following the delivery by holder to the warrant agent of a legended certificate representing such warrants or shares of common stock, as applicable, deliver or cause to be delivered to the holder a certificate representing such warrants or shares of common stock that is free from such legend. in the event any of the legends referenced in sections 2.1 or 3.6(e) are removed from any of the 27 warrants or shares of common stock, and thereafter the effectiveness of a registration statement covering such warrants or shares of common stock is suspended or the company determines that a supplement or amendment thereto is required by applicable securities laws, then the company may require that such legends, as applicable, be placed on any such applicable warrants or shares of common stock that cannot then be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or under rule 144

price as adjusted and then in effect for the warrant. dividend rate: 0 (which reflects the fact that the antidilution adjustment provisions cover all dividends). interest rate: the annual yield as of the reference date (expressed on a semi-annual basis in the manner in which u.s. treasury notes are ordinarily quoted) of the u.s. treasury note maturing approximately at the expiration date as selected by the independent financial expert. put or call: call time to expiration the number of days from the expiration date (as defined in section 3.3) to the reference date divided by 365. settlement date: the scheduled date of payment of the cash redemption value. volatility: for calculation of cash redemption value in connection with a change of control event with respect to the warrants, the lesser of (a) 30% or (b) the volatility of the company as determined by an independent financial expert engaged to make the calculation, who shall be instructed to assume for purposes of the determination of volatility referred to in this clause (b) that the change of control event had not occurred; provided , however , that if the warrants are adjusted as a result of a change of control event, volatility for purposes of calculating cash redemption value in connection with succeeding change of control events with respect to such warrants (or their successors) shall be as determined by an independent financial expert engaged to make the calculation, who shall be instructed to assume for purposes of the calculation that such succeeding change of control event had not occurred. such valuation of the warrant shall not be discounted in any way. for illustrative purposes only, an example black-scholes model calculation with respect to a hypothetical warrant appears on the following page. illustrative example inputs : s = underlying security price x = exercise price pv(x) = present value of the exercise price, discounted at a rate of r = x * (e^-(r * t)) v = volatility r = continuously compounded risk free rate = 2 * &#091; ln (1 &#043; interest rate / 2) &#093; t = time to expiration w = warrant value per underlying share z = number of shares underlying warrants value = total warrant value formulaic inputs : d1 = &#091; ln &#091; s / x &#093; &#043; (r &#043; (v^2 / 2)) * t)&#093; &#247; (v * &#214; t) d2 = &#091; ln &#091; s / x &#093; &#043; (r - (v^2 / 2)) * t)&#093; &#247; (v * &#214; t) black-scholes formula w = &#091;n(d1) * s&#093; - &#091;n(d2) * pv(x)&#093; where &#147;n&#148; is the cumulative normal probability function value = w * z
