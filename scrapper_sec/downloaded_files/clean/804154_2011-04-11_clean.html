note &#8221;), as more fully described below. &#160; under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the issuer also agreed to issue 596,500,000 shares of common stock (the &#8220; holdback shares &#8221;) that it will hold in escrow.&#160;&#160;from time to time, the issuer will release to the buyer a number of the holdback shares in proportion to the extent to which the note facility has been drawn upon.&#160;&#160;to ensure the buyer has the opportunity to enjoy the full benefit of notes and the holdback shares, the buyer shall have the right (such right, the &#8220; note funding right &#8221;), at any time and from time to time, to make advances to the issuer from the note facility, and require the issuer borrow funds, in an amount up to the then-undrawn commitment amount. &#160; &#160;&#160;the issuer further agreed to issue to the buyer warrants (each, a &#8220; warrant &#8221;) to purchase common stock if certain performance targets (each, a &#8220; performance target &#8221;) are achieved, as more fully described below.&#160;&#160;to ensure that the buyer can exercise any warrant or convert the principal and accrued interest of any note it is issued, the issuer agreed to reserve from its authorized capital stock a number of shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise or conversion.&#160;&#160;moreover, if, at any time, the issuer does not have enough duly authorized shares to fulfill this obligation, the securities purchase agreement requires the issuer to use its best efforts to increase the number of authorized shares. &#160; &#160; page 8 of 18 pages &#160; &#160; the issuer agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of securities under the securities purchase agreement to fund working capital, repayment of certain accounts receivable, payment of certain tax obligations, capital expenditures and required investments in the joint venture. &#160;

(c) deliver to the buyer an opinion of counsel to the issuer, each of the guarantor subsidiaries and each of such affiliated creditors; (d) cause the execution and delivery of the license agreements and a certain escrow agreement concerning the shares of the joint venture and (e) agree upon, execute and deliver indemnification agreements with the directors of the issuer.&#160;&#160;in addition, the issuer agreed to cause the adoption of an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the issuer to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to a number sufficient to allow the conversion in full of all notes and exercise in full of all warrants contemplated by the securities purchase agreement as soon as is practicable after the closing (the &#8220; closing &#8221;) thereof.&#160;&#160;the issuer also agreed to cause any entity that (i) becomes a direct or indirect subsidiary of the issuer and (ii) has material business operations or assets to execute and deliver to the buyer a guaranty substantially in the form of the applicable subsidiary guaranty. &#160; the buyer agreed to provide an opinion of counsel to frazer-nash and the buyer within thirty (30) days of the closing. &#160; concurrently with signing, the frazer-nash and/or certain of its affiliates placed an order (the &#8220; purchase order &#8221;) for the purchase of battery packs from ltc containing at least 14,400 battery cells. &#160; d.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; notes . &#160; each note will have a principal amount equal to the amount of the advance that it evinces and accrues interest at 9.0 percent per annum, compounded annually; provided that following a payment event of default the interest rate shall increase to 18.0 percent per annum.&#160;&#160;interest under the note is not payable in cash.&#160;&#160;the note will mature, and become due and payable, on june 30, 2013 (the &#8220; maturity date &#8221;) or any earlier event of default. &#160; events of default under the note include:&#160;&#160;(a) failure by the issuer to make any payment of principal on the maturity date; (b) default in the performance or observance of any material covenant contained in the note that remains uncured for ten (10) business days after the issuer receives notice thereof; (c) the acceleration of any other indebtedness of the issuer or any of the guarantor subsidiaries (except for any acceleration caused by the buyer or any of its affiliates); (d) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events with respect to the issuer or one of the guarantor subsidiaries and (e) breach of the post-closing delivery covenant. &#160; the buyer may elect at any time prior to the maturity date to convert all or part of the note&#8217;s principal and accrued interest into a number of shares of common stock equal to (i) the amount of principal and interest converted divided by (ii) $0.03. &#160; the note also contains a number of negative covenants, including certain restrictions on the ability of issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries to incur or satisfy indebtedness, pay dividends, make other distributions or reacquire any of their capital stock. &#160; &#160; page 9 of 18 pages &#160; &#160; at the closing, the issuer issued to the buyer the closing note, as described in item 5(c) below. &#160; e.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; subsidiary guarantees . &#160; upon entering into a subsidiary guaranty, each guarantor subsidiary will guarantee the performance of the issuer&#8217;s obligations under the note (the &#8220; guaranteed obligations &#8221;).&#160;&#160;under the terms of the subsidiary guarantees, each guarantor subsidiary will be prohibited from incurring any new indebtedness other than indebtedness that, by its terms, is expressly subordinated to the guaranteed obligations. &#160; the subsidiary guarantees limit the payment obligation of each guarantor subsidiary thereunder to the amount of its distributable reserves.&#160;&#160;if certain bankruptcy events occur with respect to a guarantor subsidiary that does not meet any of its payment obligations under the guaranty because of this limitation, all unfulfilled payment obligations will constitute unsecured liabilities of the guarantor&#8217;s estate senior to the claims of the issuer and each of the affiliated creditors but subject to the prior satisfaction of claims (including tax claims required by applicable law) against the guarantor subsidiary held by creditors who are not affiliated creditors. &#160; f.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; warrants . &#160; the securities purchase agreement obligates the issuer to issue to the buyer various warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,915,000,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.024 to $0.06 if various performance targets related to the sale or execution of contracts for the delivery of battery cells or battery packs to vehicle manufacturers or to frazer-nash and its affiliates are met by specified dates ranging from july 1, 2011 to july 1, 2015.&#160;&#160;&#160;schedules iia and iib of the securities purchase agreement, which set forth each performance target, the specified date by which each performance target must be met, the number of shares purchasable under the warrant that will be awarded upon achievement of each performance target and the exercise price for such warrants, are hereby incorporated by reference to exhibit 3 hereto. &#160; the securities purchase agreement further provides that if the applicable performance target is not achieved by the specified date, but is at least 90.0 percent performed by such date, then the buyer will receive a warrant to purchase a number of shares of common stock pro-rated to reflect the portion of the applicable performance target achieved. &#160; all warrants (other than the closing warrant (as defined below)) will (i) vest upon issuance and may be exercised after the note facility has been fully drawn and all notes then outstanding have been fully converted, (ii) have a term of one (1) year from the date of issuance during which it may be exercised and (iii) contain customary anti-dilution provisions. &#160; at the closing, the issuer issued a separate warrant to the buyer (the &#8220; closing warrant &#8221;) that allows the buyer to purchase shares of common stock at the price of $0.01 per share through a cashless exercise.&#160;&#160;designed to provide the buyer with anti-dilution protection against the exercise or conversion of the options, warrants, notes, debentures and other securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock outstanding at the closing (the &#8220; specified securities &#8221;), the closing warrant entitles the buyer to purchase a number of shares, if any, that will cause the buyer to own 35.0 percent of the shares of common stock outstanding as of the closing after the exercise or conversion of such specified securities, assuming the full funding and conversion of the notes and giving effect to the exercise of the closing warrant on a mandatory cashless exercise basis.&#160;&#160;accordingly, the closing warrant was not exercisable for any shares following the closing.&#160;&#160;the closing warrant vests upon issuance and may be exercised at any time on or after the date of issuance until the last of specified securities cease to be outstanding and exercisable or convertible. &#160; &#160; page 10 of 18 pages &#160; &#160; g.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; investor rights agreement . &#160; in connection with the securities purchase agreement, issuer and the buyer also entered into an investor rights agreement (the &#8220; investor rights agreement &#8221;), which grants the buyer certain registration rights, board designation and governance rights, consent rights over major decisions by the issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries and a right of first refusal over certain issuances by the issuer. &#160;

the investor rights agreement grants the buyer the right to designate a number of individuals (the &#8220; designees &#8221;) as described below for appointment to the board of directors of the issuer (the &#8220; board &#8221;) and requires the issuer to cause the appointment of such designees to the board.&#160;&#160;if the buyer and its affiliates own at least 208,333,333 shares of common stock, the buyer may name one (1) designee.&#160;&#160;if the percentage interest (inclusive of any shares issuable upon the exercise of the closing warrant and the conversion of any outstanding notes, but disregarding any shares of common stock held by the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, including the holdback shares) of the buyer and its affiliates in the common stock is greater than 20.0&#160;percent, buyer may name two (2) designees.&#160;&#160;to ensure the election of the designees at subsequent meetings of the stockholders of the issuer, the issuer must also (i) nominate the designees for election to the board, (ii) name such designees as a nominee for management in any form of proxy sent to shareholders of the issuer, (iii)&#160;recommend that shareholders of the issuer vote for such designees and (iv) vote for such designees all proxies in favor of the issuer or any of its officers or directors. &#160; the investor rights agreement further provides that the issuer must cause the appointment of directors who are designees (the &#8220; buyer directors &#8221;) to the audit committee of the board (the &#8220; audit committee &#8221;).&#160;&#160;if there are two buyer directors, the issuer must cause the resignations of a number of directors who are not buyer directors so that the buyer directors constitute a majority of the audit committee. &#160; as long as the buyer and its affiliates own at least 208,333,333 shares of common stock, the issuer may not increase the number of seats on the board to more than five (5) without the prior written consent of the buyer.&#160;&#160;further, from the time the note facility has been fully drawn until the later to occur of the time at which (a) the percentage interest (inclusive of any shares issuable upon the exercise of the closing warrant and the conversion of any outstanding notes, but disregarding any shares of common stock held by the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, including the holdback shares) but disregarding any shares of common stock owned by the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, including the holdback shares) of the buyer and its affiliates in the common stock is less than 35.0&#160;percent or (b) the buyer has sold any shares of common stock, the issuer may not do, and may not permit its subsidiaries to do, any of a series of actions (the &#8220; major decisions &#8221;) without the prior written consent of the buyer.&#160;&#160;section 4.5 of the investor rights agreement, which sets forth each major decision, is hereby incorporated by reference to exhibit a to the securities purchase agreement. &#160; &#160; page 11 of 18 pages &#160; &#160; in addition, as long as the buyer and its affiliates own at least 208,333,333 shares of common stock, the investor rights agreement grants the buyer a right of first refusal to purchase all common stock and common stock equivalents that the issuer proposes to issue to third parties (other than pursuant to certain excluded issuances) on the same terms and conditions as the proposed issuance to such third party. &#160; the buyer designated william chia as a designee, who was appointed to the board as a director at the closing.&#160;&#160;the board also appointed mr. chia as a member of the audit committee. &#160; h.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

the buyer and the arch hill parties also granted each other a right of first refusal to purchase all common stock and common stock equivalents that the other proposes to transfer to third parties on the same terms and conditions as the proposed transfer to such third party. &#160;
