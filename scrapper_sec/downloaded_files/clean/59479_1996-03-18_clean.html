(the "borrower") has requested credit facilities (the "facilities") in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 (the "aggregate commitment"). the borrower has indicated that it intends to acquire a company which you have identified to us and which you and we have described by the code name "sentry" (herein, the "company") pursuant to a two-step acquisition. the first step will consist of an all cash tender offer by means of an offer to purchase (as amended from time to time, the "tender offer") to be made by a newly formed subsidiary (the "acquisition sub") of the borrower for all of the outstanding common stock of company (the "stock") for total consideration in form and amount acceptable to the lenders (as defined below). prior to the making of the tender offer, acquisition sub and the company shall have entered into a definitive plan and agreement of merger (the "merger agreement") to merge acquisition sub and the company, subject to shareholder approval by the shareholders of acquisition sub and the company (the "merger") (the tender offer and the merger, collectively the "acquisition"). the tender offer will be conditioned on the tender and purchase of at least a majority, on a fully diluted basis, of the shares of stock of the company (or any greater number of shares as may be required under applicable state law or the company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws to vote for and effect a merger of the company and acquisition sub). the second step of the acquisition will consist of the merger. the definitive legal structure of the tender offer and merger have not yet been determined and must be satisfactory to the lenders. nbd bank, n.a. is pleased to provide you with a financing commitment for, and to agree to act as administrative agent bank (the "agent") in connection with, the entire amount of the facilities on the terms and conditions set forth in the term sheet attached hereto ("term sheet") and subject to the conditions set forth in this letter. first chicago capital markets, inc.

and (iii) assert no claim against any indemnified persons seeking consequential damages on any theory of liability in connection in any way with the transaction which is the subject of this commitment letter. the obligations described in this paragraph are independent of all other obligations of the borrower hereunder and under the loan documents, shall survive the expiration, revocation or termination of this commitment letter, and shall be payable whether or not the financing transactions contemplated by this commitment letter shall close. the agent's and the arranger's respective obligations under this commitment letter are enforceable solely by the party signing this commitment letter and may not be relied upon by any other person. for purposes of enforcing this indemnity, the borrower irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive 3 continuing our letter of february 8, 1996 sheet no. 3 jurisdiction of any court in which a claim arising out of or relating to the services provided under this commitment letter is properly brought against the agent, the arranger, or the lenders and irrevocably waives any objection as to venue or inconvenient forum. if this commitment letter, the term sheet, the fee letter (defined below), or any act, omission or event described in this paragraph becomes the subject of a dispute, the parties hereto all hereby waive trial by jury. the borrower agrees not to settle any claim, litigation or proceeding relating to this transaction (whether or not the agent or the arranger is a party thereto) unless such settlement releases all indemnified persons from any and all liability in respect of such transaction. the agent's commitment and the arranger's undertaking are subject to (i) the preparation, execution, and delivery of a mutually acceptable credit agreement ("credit agreement") and other loan documents (collectively, the "loan documents") incorporating, without limitation, substantially the terms and the conditions outlined herein and in the term sheet;

shares in each of the offer and the merger is fair to such holders. such opinion is attached to the company's solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 (the "schedule 14d-9"), which is being mailed to stockholders of the company herewith. the offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date (as defined in section 1) that number of shares which represents at least a majority of the number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis (the "minimum condition"). see sections 1, 14 and 15. three stockholders beneficially holding approximately 48% of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis have entered into agreements with parent pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to tender their shares pursuant to the offer as more fully described herein. the offer is being made pursuant to the merger agreement, dated as of march 4, 1996 (the "merger agreement"), among parent, the purchaser and the company pursuant to which, following the consummation of the offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, the purchaser will be merged with and into the company, with the company surviving the merger (as such, the "surviving corporation") as a wholly owned subsidiary of parent (the "merger"). in the merger, each outstanding share (other than shares held by (i) parent, the purchaser or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent or purchaser or in the treasury of the company or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the company or (ii) stockholders, if any, who are 1 4 entitled to and who properly exercise dissenters' rights under delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the per share price paid in the offer in cash, without interest (the "merger consideration"). see section 12. the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including approval by stockholders of the company, if such approval is required by applicable law. in the event the purchaser acquires 90% or more of the outstanding shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise, the purchaser would be able to effect the merger pursuant to the short-form merger provisions of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"), without prior notice to, or any action by, any other stockholder of the company. see section 12. the company has informed the purchaser that, as of february 28, 1996, there were 9,638,663 shares issued and outstanding and 597,970 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. accordingly, the purchaser believes that the minimum condition will be satisfied, based on the foregoing assumptions, if approximately 5,118,817 shares are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date (as defined below). if the minimum condition is satisfied and the purchaser accepts for payment shares tendered pursuant to the offer, the purchaser will be able to elect a majority of the members of the company's board of directors and to effect the merger without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder of the company. parent has entered into letter agreements (each a "letter agreement") with each of the following stockholders of the company: irwin w. uran, james l. sadler, a director of the company, and john h. sadler, the brother of james l. sadler (collectively, the "principal stockholders"). pursuant to the letter agreements, each principal stockholder has agreed, among other things, to tender and not withdraw all shares beneficially owned by him, not to sell, transfer or grant any voting rights with respect to any of his shares, not to purchase additional shares while the merger agreement is in effect and to vote all of his shares in favor of the merger and against any action or arrangement which would interfere with the successful completion of the offer or merger. the letter agreements will remain in effect until the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are successfully completed or until the merger agreement is terminated by parent or the company in accordance with its terms. based on representations made by the principal stockholders to parent and the purchaser as of the date of the letter agreements, the principal stockholders collectively own 4,952,020 shares (including options to acquire 7,880 shares), or approximately 48% of the total outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. the merger agreement and the letter agreements are more fully described in section 12. certain federal income tax consequences of the sale of shares pursuant to the offer and the exchange of shares for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger are described in section 5. this offer to purchase and the related letter of transmittal contain important information and should be read in their entirety before any decision is made with respect to the offer. 1. terms of the offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, the purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all shares validly tendered prior to the expiration date and not theretofore withdrawn in accordance with section 3. the term "expiration date" means 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on thursday, april 4, 1996, unless and until the purchaser shall have extended the period of time during which the offer is open, in which event the term "expiration date" shall mean the latest time and date at which the offer, as so extended by the purchaser, shall expire. the offer is subject to certain conditions set forth in section 14, including satisfaction of the minimum condition and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the purchaser's acquisition of shares pursuant to the offer under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended (the "hsr act"). if any such condition is not satisfied the purchaser may (1) terminate the offer and return all tendered shares to tendering stockholders, (2) extend the offer and, subject to withdrawal rights as set forth in section 3, retain all such shares until the expiration of the offer as so extended, (3) waive such 2 5 condition and, subject to any requirements to extend the period of time during which the offer is open, purchase all shares validly tendered by the expiration date and not withdrawn or (4) delay acceptance for payment of or payment for shares, subject to applicable law, until satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the offer and subject to the right of the purchaser to extend the offer as set forth below and in section 12. the purchaser has agreed that, without the prior written consent of the company, the purchaser will not (1) decrease the price per share or change the form of consideration payable in the offer, (2) decrease the number of shares sought, (3) amend or waive satisfaction of the minimum condition or (4) impose conditions to the offer in addition to those set forth in section 14 or amend any other term of the offer in any manner adverse to the holders of shares. in the merger agreement, the purchaser has agreed, subject to the conditions in section 14 and its rights under the offer, to accept for payment shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as soon as practicable after the later of (1) the expiration date, and (2) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in section 14. for a description of the purchaser's right to extend the period of time during which the offer is open, and to amend, delay or terminate the offer, see sections 12 and 14. there can be no assurance that the purchaser will exercise its right to extend the offer. any extension, waiver, amendment or termination of the offer will be followed as promptly as practicable by public announcement. in the case of an extension, rule 14e-1(d) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), requires that the announcement be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., new york city time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date in accordance with the public announcement requirements of rule 14d-4(d) under the exchange act. subject to applicable law (including rules 14d-4(c) and 14d-6(d) under the exchange act, which require that any material change in the information published, sent or given to stockholders in connection with the offer be promptly disseminated to stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform stockholders of such change), and without limiting the manner in which the purchaser may choose to make any public announcement, the purchaser will not have any obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such public announcement other than by making a release to the dow jones news service. if the purchaser extends the offer or if the purchaser (whether before or after its acceptance for payment of shares) is delayed in its acceptance for payment of or payment for shares or it is unable to pay for shares pursuant to the offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to the purchaser's rights under the offer, the depositary may retain tendered shares on behalf of the purchaser, and such shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent tendering stockholders are entitled to withdrawal rights as described in section 3. however, the ability of the purchaser to delay the payment for shares that the purchaser has accepted for payment is limited by rule 14e-1 under the exchange act, which requires that a bidder pay the consideration offered or return the securities deposited by or on behalf of holders of securities promptly after the termination or withdrawal of such bidder's offer. if the purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the offer or the information concerning the offer or waives a material condition of the offer (including a waiver of the minimum condition, which cannot be waived without the company's consent), the purchaser will disseminate additional tender offer materials and extend the offer to the extent required by rules 14d-4(c), 14d-6(d) and 14e-1 under the exchange act. the minimum period during which an offer must remain open following material changes in the terms of the offer or information concerning the offer, other than a change in price or a change in the percentage of securities sought, will depend upon the facts and circumstances then existing, including the relative materiality of the changed terms or information. with respect to a change in price or a change in the percentage of securities sought, a minimum period of 10 business days is generally required to allow for adequate dissemination to stockholders. if prior to the expiration date, the purchaser should decide to increase the price per share being offered in the offer, such increase will be applicable to all stockholders whose shares are accepted for payment pursuant to the offer. as used in this offer to purchase, "business day" means any day other than a saturday, sunday or a federal holiday and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12 midnight, new york city time as computed in accordance with rule 14d-1 under the exchange act. the company has provided the purchaser with the company's stockholder lists and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the offer to holders of the shares. this offer to purchase, the related letter of transmittal and other relevant materials will be mailed by the purchaser to record holders of shares 3 6 and will be furnished by the purchaser to brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder lists or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of shares. 2. procedure for tendering shares valid tender. for a stockholder validly to tender shares pursuant to the offer, either (1) a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), together with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message (as defined below) in connection with a book-entry delivery of shares, and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal, must be received by the depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this offer to purchase and either certificates for tendered shares must be received by the depositary at one of such addresses or such shares must be delivered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer set forth below (and a book-entry confirmation (as defined below) received by the depositary), in each case prior to the expiration date, or (2) the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedure set forth below. the depositary will establish an account with respect to the shares at the depository trust company, midwest securities trust company and philadelphia depository trust company (the "book-entry transfer facilities") for purposes of the offer within two business days after the date of this offer. any financial institution that is a participant in any of the book-entry transfer facilities' systems may make book-entry delivery of shares by causing a book-entry transfer facility to transfer such shares into the depositary's account in accordance with such book-entry transfer facility's procedures for such transfer. however, although delivery of shares may be effected through book-entry transfer into the depositary's account at a book-entry transfer facility, the letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and any other required documents, must, in any case, be transmitted to, and received by, the depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this offer to purchase prior to the expiration date, or the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedure described below. the confirmation of a book-entry transfer of shares into the depositary's account at a book-entry transfer facility as described above is referred to herein as a "book-entry confirmation." delivery of documents to a book-entry transfer facility in accordance with such book-entry transfer facility's procedures does not constitute delivery to the depositary. the method of delivery of shares, the letter of transmittal and all other required documents, including delivery through any book-entry transfer facility, is at the election and risk of the tendering stockholder. shares will be deemed delivered only when actually received by the depositary. if delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended. in all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely delivery. the term "agent's message" means a message, transmitted by a book-entry transfer facility to, and received by, the depositary and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation, which states that such book entry transfer facility has received an express acknowledgement from the participant in such book-entry transfer facility tendering the shares that are the subject of such book-entry confirmation, that such participant has received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that purchaser may enforce such agreement against such participant. signature guarantees. no signature guarantee is required on the letter of transmittal if (1) the letter of transmittal is signed by the registered holder of shares (which term, for purposes of this section, includes any participant in any of the book-entry transfer facilities' systems whose name appears on a security position listing as the owner of the shares) tendered therewith and such registered holder has not completed either the box entitled "special delivery instructions" or the box entitled "special payment instructions" on 4 7 the letter of transmittal or (2) such shares are tendered for the account of a firm that is a member of a registered national securities exchange or of the national association of securities dealers, inc. (the "nasd"), or a commercial bank, trust company or savings institution having an office or correspondent in the united states (each, an "eligible institution"). in all other cases, all signatures on the letters of transmittal must be guaranteed by a recognized member of a medallion signature guaranty program or by an eligible institution. see instructions 1 and 5 to the letter of transmittal. if the certificates for shares are registered in the name of a person other than the signer of the letter of transmittal, or if payment is to be made or certificates for shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be issued to a person other than the registered holder of the certificates surrendered, the tendered certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered holders or owners appear on the certificates, with the signatures on the certificates or stock powers guaranteed as specified above. see instruction 5 to the letter of transmittal. guaranteed delivery. if a stockholder desires to tender shares pursuant to the offer and such stockholder's certificates for shares are not immediately available or the procedure for book-entry transfer cannot be completed on a timely basis or time will not permit all required documents to reach the depositary prior to the expiration date, such stockholder's tender may be effected if all the following conditions are met: (1) such tender is made by or through an eligible institution; (2) a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery substantially in the form provided by the purchaser is received by the depositary, as provided below, prior to the expiration date; and (3) the certificates for all tendered shares, in proper form for transfer (or a book-entry confirmation with respect to such shares), together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message) and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal, are received by the depositary within three trading days after the date of execution of such notice of guaranteed delivery. a "trading day" is any day on which the new york stock exchange, inc. (the "nyse") is open for business. the notice of guaranteed delivery may be delivered by hand to the depositary or transmitted by telegram, facsimile transmission or mail to the depositary and must include a guarantee by an eligible institution in the form set forth in such notice of guaranteed delivery. notwithstanding any other provision hereof, payment for shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer will in all cases be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of (1) certificates for (or a timely book-entry confirmation with respect to) such shares, (2) a letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and (3) any other documents required by the letter of transmittal. accordingly, tendering stockholders may be paid at different times depending upon when certificates for shares or book-entry confirmations are actually received by the depositary. under no circumstances will interest be paid on the purchase price for the shares to be paid by the purchaser, regardless of any extension of the offer or any delay in making such payment. the valid tender of shares pursuant to one of the procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between the tendering stockholder and the purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer. appointment. by executing a letter of transmittal as set forth above, the tendering stockholder irrevocably appoints designees of the purchaser as such stockholder's attorneys-in-fact and proxies in the manner set forth in the letter of transmittal, each with full power of substitution, to the full extent of such stockholder's rights with respect to the shares tendered by such stockholder and accepted for payment by the purchaser and with respect to any and all other shares or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such shares on or after march 4, 1996. all such proxies shall be considered coupled with an interest in the 5 8 tendered shares. such appointment will be effective when, and only to the extent that, the purchaser accepts for payment shares tendered by such stockholder as provided herein. upon such acceptance for payment, all prior powers of attorney and proxies given by such stockholder with respect to such shares or other securities or rights will, without further action, be revoked and no subsequent powers of attorney and proxies may be given (and, if given, will not be deemed effective). the designees of the purchaser will thereby be empowered to exercise voting and other rights with respect to such shares or other securities or rights in respect of any annual, special or adjourned meeting of the company's stockholders, or otherwise, as they in their sole discretion deem proper. the purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the purchaser's acceptance for payment of such shares, the purchaser must be able to exercise voting and other rights with respect to such shares and other securities or rights, including voting at any meeting of stockholders then scheduled. determination of validity. all questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any tender of shares will be determined by the purchaser in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding. the purchaser reserves the absolute right to reject any or all tenders determined by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of or payment for which may, in the opinion of the purchaser's counsel, be unlawful. the purchaser also reserves the absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity in any tender with respect to any particular shares, whether or not similar defects or irregularities are waived in the case of other shares. no tender of shares will be deemed to have been validly made until all defects or irregularities relating thereto have been cured or waived. none of the purchaser, parent, the depositary, the information agent or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. the purchaser's interpretation of the terms and conditions of the offer (including the letter of transmittal and the instructions thereto) will be final and binding. backup withholding. in order to avoid "backup withholding" of federal income tax on payments of cash pursuant to the offer, a stockholder surrendering shares in the offer must provide the depositary with such stockholder's correct taxpayer identification number ("tin") on a substitute form w-9 and certify under penalties of perjury that such tin is correct and that such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding. certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to backup withholding. if a stockholder does not provide its correct tin or fails to provide the certifications described above, the internal revenue service ("irs") may impose a penalty on such stockholder and payment of cash to such stockholder pursuant to the offer may be subject to backup withholding of 31%. all stockholders surrendering shares pursuant to the offer should complete and sign the main signature box and the substitute form w-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding (unless an applicable exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to the purchaser and the depositary). non-corporate foreign stockholders should complete and sign the main signature box and a form w-8, certificate of foreign status, a copy of which may be obtained from the depositary, in order to avoid backup withholding. see instruction 10 to the letter of transmittal. 3. withdrawal rights except as otherwise provided in this section 3, tenders of shares are irrevocable. shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn pursuant to the procedures set forth below at any time prior to the expiration date and, unless theretofore accepted for payment and paid for by the purchaser pursuant to the offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after may 6, 1996. for a withdrawal to be effective, a written, telegraphic or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this offer to purchase and must specify the name of the person having tendered the shares to be withdrawn, the number of shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of the shares to be withdrawn, if different from the name of the person who tendered the shares. if certificates for shares have been delivered or otherwise identified to the depositary, then, prior to the physical release of such certificates, the serial numbers shown on such certificates must be submitted to the depositary and, unless such shares have been tendered by an 6 9 eligible institution, the signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed in a manner required by section 2 hereof. if shares have been delivered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer as set forth in section 2, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the account at the appropriate book entry transfer facility to be credited with the withdrawn shares and otherwise comply with such book entry transfer facility's procedures. withdrawals of tenders of shares may not be rescinded, and any shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not validly tendered for any purposes of the offer. however, withdrawn shares may be retendered by again following one of the procedures described in section 2 at any time prior to the expiration date. all questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be determined by the purchaser in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding. none of the purchaser, parent, the depositary, the information agent or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. 4. acceptance for payment and payment upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer (including, if the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or amendment), the purchaser will accept for payment and will pay for all shares validly tendered prior to the expiration date and not properly withdrawn in accordance with section 3 as soon as practicable after the later of (1) the expiration date, and (2) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in section 14. for a description of the purchaser's right to terminate the offer and not accept for payment or pay for shares or to delay acceptance for payment or payment for shares, see sections 12 and 14. in all cases, payment for shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of (1) certificates for such shares (or timely book-entry confirmation of a transfer of such shares as described in section 2), (2) a letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message) and (3) any other documents required by the letter of transmittal. the per share consideration paid to any stockholder pursuant to the offer will be the highest per share consideration paid to any other stockholder pursuant to the offer. for purposes of the offer, the purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment, and thereby purchased, shares properly tendered to the purchaser and not withdrawn as, if and when the purchaser gives oral or written notice to the depositary of the purchaser's acceptance for payment of such shares. payment for shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the depositary, which will act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payment from the purchaser and transmitting payment to tendering stockholders. under no circumstances will interest be paid on the purchase price for the shares to be paid by the purchaser, regardless of any extension of the offer or any delay in making such payment. if the purchaser is delayed in its acceptance for payment of or payment for shares or is unable to accept for payment or pay for shares pursuant to the offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to the purchaser's rights under the offer (but subject to compliance with rule 14e-1(c) under the exchange act, which requires that a tender offeror pay the consideration offered or return the tendered securities promptly after the termination or withdrawal of a tender offer), the depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of the purchaser, retain tendered shares, and such shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent tendering stockholders are entitled to exercise, and duly exercise, withdrawal rights as described in section 3. if any tendered shares are not purchased pursuant to the offer because of an invalid tender or otherwise, certificates for any such shares will be returned, without expense to the tendering stockholder (or, in the case of shares delivered by book-entry transfer of such shares into the depositary's account at a book-entry transfer facility pursuant to the procedure set forth in section 2, such shares will be credited to an account 7 10 maintained at the appropriate book-entry transfer facility), as promptly as practicable after the expiration or termination of the offer. the purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of parent, the right to purchase shares tendered pursuant to the offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve the purchaser of its obligations under the offer and will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the offer. 5. certain federal income tax consequences sales of shares pursuant to the offer (and the receipt of the right to receive cash by stockholders of the company pursuant to the merger) will be taxable transactions for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), and may also be taxable transactions under applicable state, local, foreign and other tax laws. for federal income tax purposes, a tendering stockholder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by the stockholder pursuant to the offer (or to be received pursuant to the merger) and the aggregate tax basis in the shares tendered by the stockholder and purchased pursuant to the offer (or cancelled pursuant to the merger). gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares tendered and purchased pursuant to the offer (or cancelled pursuant to the merger). under current law, the maximum federal tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains recognized by an individual is 28%, and the maximum federal tax rate applicable to ordinary income (including dividends and short-term capital gains recognized by individuals) is 39.6%. the maximum federal tax rate applicable to all capital gains and ordinary income recognized by a corporation is 35%. it is possible that legislation may be enacted that would reduce the maximum federal tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains, possibly with retroactive effect. it is not possible to predict whether or in what form any such legislation may be enacted. a stockholder (other than certain exempt stockholders including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals) that tenders shares may be subject to 31% backup withholding unless the stockholder provides its tin and certifies that such number is correct or properly certifies that it is awaiting a tin. a stockholder that does not furnish its tin may be subject to a penalty imposed by the irs. each stockholder should complete and sign the substitute form w-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal so as to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding. if backup withholding applies to a stockholder, the depositary is required to withhold 31% from payments to such stockholder. backup withholding is not an additional tax. rather, the amount of the backup withholding can be credited against the federal income tax liability of the person subject to the backup withholding, provided that the required information is given to the irs. if backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a refund can be obtained by the stockholder upon filing an income tax return. the foregoing discussion may not be applicable with respect to shares received pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or with respect to holders of shares who are subject to special tax treatment under the code, such as non-u.s. persons, life insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations and financial institutions, and may not apply to a holder of shares in view of its individual circumstances. stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws) of the offer and the merger. 8 11 6. price range of the shares; dividends on the shares the shares are listed and traded on the nyse under the symbol "gpi." the following table sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, the high and low last reported sales prices and dividends paid per share as published in financial sources. sales price ------------- low high dividend ---- ---- --------- 1994 first quarter.................................... $12 1/8 $16 5/8 $0.08 second quarter................................... 9 12 3/4 0.08 third quarter.................................... 9 12 3/8 0.08 fourth quarter................................... 10 1/8 12 7/8 0.08 1995 first quarter.................................... 9 7/8 12 5/8 0.08 second quarter................................... 12 13 0.08 third quarter.................................... 12 3/4 15 1/4 0.08 fourth quarter................................... 11 1/4 14 1/4 0.08 1996 first quarter (through march 6, 1996)....................... 13 1/4 22 7/8 0.09 on march 1, 1996, the last full day of trading before the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, the reported closing sale price of the shares was $20 3/4 per share. on march 7, 1996, the last full day of trading before the commencement of the offer, the reported closing sale price of the shares on the nyse was $22 3/4 per share. stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for the shares. pursuant to the merger agreement, the company has agreed not to declare, set aside, or pay any additional dividend or other distribution in respect of the shares until the consummation of the merger, except for the normal quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 1996 in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about march 21, 1996 to stockholders of record on march 7, 1996. 7. effect of the offer on the market for the shares; stock exchange listing; registration under the exchange act the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly and may reduce the number of holders of shares, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining shares held by the stockholders other than the purchaser. the purchaser cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for or marketability of the shares or whether it would cause future market prices to be greater or less than the offer price. depending upon the number of shares purchased pursuant to the offer, the shares may no longer meet the requirements of the nyse for continued listing and may, therefore, be delisted from such exchange. according to the nyse's published guidelines, the nyse could consider delisting the shares if, among other things, the number of publicly-held shares (excluding shares held by officers, directors, their immediate families and other concentrated holdings of 10% or more) were less than 600,000, there were less than 1,200 holders of at least 100 shares or the aggregate market value of the publicly-held shares (excluding shares held by officers, directors, their immediate families and other concentrated holdings of 10% or more) were less than $5 million. if, as a result of the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, the shares no longer meet the requirements of the nyse for continued listing and the listing of shares is discontinued, the market for the shares could be adversely affected. if the nyse were to delist the shares, it is possible that the shares would trade on another securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market and that price quotations for the shares would be reported by such exchange or through nasdaq or other sources. the extent of the public market for the shares and availability of such quotations would, however, depend upon such factors as the number of holders and the aggregate market value of the publicly-held shares at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in the 9 12 shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration of the shares under the exchange act and other factors. the shares are currently "margin securities" under the regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve board"), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of such shares. depending upon factors similar to those described above regarding listing and market quotations, the shares might no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the federal reserve board's margin regulations and, therefore, could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers. the shares are currently registered under the exchange act. such registration may be terminated if the shares are not listed on a national securities exchange and there are less than 300 holders of record. termination of the registration of the shares under the exchange act would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by the company to holders of shares and to the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") and would make certain of the provisions of the exchange act, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of section 16(b), the requirement of furnishing a proxy or information statement in connection with stockholder action and the related requirement of an annual report to stockholders and the requirements of rule 13e-3 under the exchange act with respect to "going private" transactions, no longer applicable to the shares. furthermore, "affiliates" of the company and persons holding "restricted securities" of the company may be deprived of the ability to dispose of such securities pursuant to rule 144 promulgated under the securities act of 1933, as amended. if registration of the shares under the exchange act were terminated, the shares would no longer be "margin securities" or eligible for listing on a securities exchange or nasdaq reporting. it is the current intention of parent to deregister the shares after consummation of the offer if the requirements for termination of registration are met. 8. certain information concerning the company the company is a delaware

right of holders of shares of capital stock to dissent from the merger and require appraisal of their shares (a "dissenting stockholder") will not be converted into the right to receive the merger

agreement provides that, as of the effective time, the company shall take, and parent shall cause the company to take, such actions to provide that by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares (the "option") that is outstanding immediately before the effective time will be canceled and, in consideration of such cancellation, each holder of an option will receive in cash an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, by which $23.00 exceeds the exercise price of the option and (ii) the number of shares subject

company, parent and the purchaser) following the effective time no holder of options or any participant in the option plans or any other such plans, programs or arrangements will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the company, the surviving corporation or any subsidiary thereof. amendment of rights agreement. the company has issued rights pursuant to the rights agreement between the company and chemical bank (formerly manufacturers hanover trust company), as rights agent. the company and the rights agent have amended the rights agreement pursuant to amendment no. 2 to rights agreement dated as of march 4, 1996, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the schedule 14d-1 and is incorporated herein by reference. the amendment provides that neither parent nor the purchaser will become an "acquiring person," that no "stock acquisition date" or "distribution date" (as those terms are defined in the rights agreement) will occur and that section 11 and section 13 of the rights agreement will not be triggered, as a result of the announcement, commencement or consummation of the offer, the execution or delivery or the merger agreement or any amendment thereto, the consummation of the merger, or the consummation of any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. under the merger agreement, the company has agreed that, unless required to do so by court order or to fulfill fiduciary obligations, the company will not redeem the rights or amend or terminate the rights agreement before consummation of the merger. as a result of amendment no. 2 to the rights plan, the company does not contemplate that any of the outstanding rights will be redeemed. no solicitation. the company has agreed, and has agreed to direct its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents to, immediately cease any existing discussions and negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined below). the company has agreed that before the effective time it will not, and it will not authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees, agents, or representatives, directly or indirectly, to, solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing or disclosing nonpublic 21 24 information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any acquisition of all or substantially all of the company by means of a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the company or its subsidiaries or acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (an "acquisition transaction"), or, subject to the proviso below, negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in substantive communications in any way with any person (other than parent, the purchaser or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) with respect to any acquisition transaction, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the company may, in response to an unsolicited written proposal with respect to an acquisition transaction from a third party reasonably believed to have the financial capability to consummate an acquisition transaction, furnish information to, and negotiate, explore, or otherwise engage in substantive discussions with, such third party, in each case if the company's board of directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisors and after receipt of the written advice of the outside legal counsel of the company, that such action is required by applicable law (including fiduciary principles thereof). in addition, the company has agreed to immediately advise parent in writing of the receipt of any inquiries or proposals relating to an acquisition transaction and any actions taken pursuant to an inquiry or proposal. standstill arrangement. under the merger agreement, parent has agreed that, for a period of three years from the date of the merger agreement, it will not, directly or indirectly, except pursuant to the merger agreement: (i) acquire or agree, offer, seek or propose to acquire, or cause to be acquired, ownership of any of the company's assets or businesses or any voting securities issued by the company or any other rights or options to acquire that ownership (including from a third party); (ii) seek or propose to influence or control the company's management or policies; or (iii) enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing. indemnification; directors' and officers' insurance. the merger agreement provides that from and after the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, parent will indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and will cause the surviving corporation (including, if necessary, providing the surviving corporation with sufficient funds) to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the present and former directors (including the company's advisory director), officers, employees and agents of the company and its subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities arising out of actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions occurring at or before the effective time to the same extent and on the same terms and conditions (including with respect to advancement of expenses) provided for in the company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and agreements in effect at the date of the merger agreement (to the extent consistent with applicable law). further, parent has agreed that for six years after the effective time, parent will cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the company, or other similar insurance no less favorable in scope, amount and type of coverage, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred before the effective time; provided, however, that parent will not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent the premiums exceed 175% of the annual premiums paid as of the date of the merger agreement by the company for such insurance (the "maximum amount"). if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the maximum amount, parent and the surviving corporation will maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the maximum amount. letter agreement indemnification. in the letter agreements, and as a condition to obtaining the same, parent has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the stockholder signatories thereto from and against any and all claims by third parties or parent (and its affiliates), judgments, fines, penalties, liabilities, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be asserted against or incurred by such stockholder signatories in connection with their entering into the letter agreements or their compliance with the terms thereof, provided that such indemnity does not protect the stockholder signatories against (i) any violations of law (other than violations alleged to have occurred as a result of their compliance with the terms and conditions of the letter agreements) or (ii) any breach by the stockholder signatories of 22 25 their commitments in the letter agreements. in the merger agreement, the company has agreed to indemnify and hold parent harmless from and against any liability, cost, or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by it in providing the indemnification required under the letter agreements; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity of the company will terminate upon the purchase of shares by parent pursuant to the offer. representations and warranties. in the merger agreement, the company has made customary representations and warranties to parent and the purchaser with respect to, among other things, the company's organization, capitalization, authority to enter into the merger agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, potential conflicts, consent and approvals, public filings, absence of certain events, undisclosed liabilities, litigation, compliance with laws, tax matters, termination, severance and employment agreements, employee benefit plans, environmental matters, assets (including real property and intellectual property), broker's fees, labor matters and information set forth in the schedule 14d-9. none of the representations or warranties in the merger agreement will survive the effective time of the merger. access; confidentiality. the company has agreed to give parent and its authorized representatives, including its legal counsel, environmental and other consultants, financial advisors, banks, financial institutions, accountants, auditors and others, during normal business hours until the effective time, full access to all facilities, personnel and operations and to all books and records of the company and its subsidiaries to inspect and evaluate the company and its operations. in addition, during that same period the company has agreed to cause its officers and the officers of its subsidiaries to give parent any financial and operating information regarding the company and its subsidiaries that parent may request. pursuant to a confidentiality agreement between the company and parent dated december 13, 1995, parent has agreed to hold in confidence all information concerning the company and its subsidiaries and not to use that information in any way detrimental to the company. a copy of the confidentiality agreement is filed as an exhibit to the schedule 14d-1 and is incorporated herein by reference. amendment. subject to applicable law, the company, parent and the purchaser may amend or supplement the merger agreement at any time before the effective time by a written instrument signed by each of them. if the stockholders of the company have approved the merger agreement, the parties may not amend or supplement the merger agreement to reduce the merger consideration, to change the form of consideration, or to effect any other change that materially adversely affects the rights of those stockholders, without the stockholders' further approval. in addition, following the election or appointment of parent's designees to constitute a majority of the company's directors, any amendment or termination of the merger agreement by the company or its board, any extension by the company or its board of the time of the performance of any obligation of parent or purchaser or waiver of any rights of the company under the merger agreement, or any consent, approval or recommendation of the company or board required under the merger agreement, will require the approval of a majority of the directors of the company then in office who are not affiliated with and were not designated by parent (if there are any then serving directors not affiliated with or designated by parent). termination. (i) the merger agreement may be terminated, and the merger may be abandoned notwithstanding approval thereof by the stockholders of the company (in which case the offer will also be abandoned unless the purchaser has already purchased shares pursuant thereto) at any time before the effective time, (a) by mutual written consent of parent and the company, (b) by either parent or the company if, without any material breach by the terminating party of its obligations under the merger agreement, the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer has not occurred on or before may 31, 1996 (or, if parent or the company receives a request for additional information under the hsr act, the earlier of (1) july 31, 1996, or (2) the earliest date following the expiration of the waiting period under the hsr act, as extended by such request, on which the purchaser may purchase shares pursuant to the terms of the offer and the applicable rules and regulations of the commission), which dates the parties to the merger agreement may extend by their mutual written consent, (c) by parent or the company if the offer expires or is terminated or withdrawn pursuant to its terms without any shares being purchased thereunder, except that parent may not terminate the merger agreement if parent's or the purchaser's termination of, or failure to accept for payment or pay for any shares tendered pursuant to, the offer does not follow the occurrence, or 23 26 failure to occur, of any offering condition or is otherwise in violation of the terms of the offer or the merger agreement, or (d) by either parent or the company if any court of competent jurisdiction in the united states or other governmental body in the united states has issued an order (other than a temporary restraining order), decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer or the merger, and such order, decree, ruling or other action has become final and nonappealable; provided, that the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement generally must have used its reasonable best efforts to remove or lift the order, decree or ruling. (ii) in addition, the merger agreement may be terminated and the offer and the merger may be abandoned by parent at any time prior to the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, if (a) the representations or warranties of the company contained in the merger agreement are not true and correct at and as of any date prior to the expiration date as if made at and as of such time, except for (i) failures to be true and correct as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a company material adverse effect and (ii) failures to comply as are capable of being and are cured (other than by mere disclosure of the breach) within 10 days after written notice from the purchaser to the company of such failure; (b) the company has failed to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement, except for (i) failures to so comply as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a company material adverse effect and (ii) failures to comply as are capable of being and are cured within 10 days after written notice from the purchaser to the company of such failure; (c) the board shall (i) withdraw its recommendation or approval in respect of the merger agreement or offer or (ii) modify or change its recommendation or approval in respect of the merger agreement, the offer or the merger in a manner adverse to parent; or (d) the board shall have recommended any proposal other than by parent or the purchaser in respect of an acquisition transaction. (iii) the merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned by the company, (a) at any time prior to the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer upon receipt of an acquisition transaction proposal that contains no financing condition which the board in good faith determines in the exercise of its fiduciary duties (based as to legal matters on the written opinion of legal counsel and after consultation with its financial advisor) it is required to accept by applicable law including the fiduciary principles thereof or (b) at any time prior to the effective time if (i) the representations and warranties of parent or the purchaser contained in the merger agreement are not true and correct as if made at and as of such time, except for (a) failures to be true and correct as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a parent material adverse effect and (b) failures to comply as are capable of being and are cured (other than by mere disclosure of the breach) within 10 days after written notice from the company to parent of such failure; or (ii) parent or the purchaser has failed to comply with their respective obligations under the merger agreement, except for (x) failures to so comply as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a parent material adverse effect and (y) failures to comply as are capable of being and are cured within 10 days after written notice from the company to parent of such failure. (iv) if the merger agreement is terminated as provided in subsections (i)-(iii) above, the merger will be deemed abandoned, the merger agreement will become void (except for certain provisions concerning confidentiality, parent's standstill undertaking, the payment of expenses and the company's indemnification with respect to the letter agreements) and no party will have any liability to or claim against any other party, except for any willful or bad faith breach of the merger agreement and except as follows. in the event that following receipt by the company of an acquisition transaction proposal the merger agreement is terminated by parent pursuant to subsection (ii)(c) or (d) above or by the company pursuant to subsection (iii)(a) above, the company has agreed to promptly pay to parent (but in any event within three business days after termination) the sum of $3,000,000, provided that no fee shall be payable if parent or the purchaser shall be in a material breach of any of its material representations, warranties or obligations hereunder as of the date of termination. if such fee is payable and within 365 days after such termination an acquisition transaction is consummated, the company shall promptly pay to parent (but in any event within three business days after the consummation of the acquisition transaction) the additional sum of $5,000,000. 24 27 "company material adverse effect" means a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations or prospects of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. "parent material adverse effect" means a material adverse effect on parent's or the purchaser's ability to perform their respective obligations pursuant to the merger agreement or to consummate the offer and merger. timing. the exact timing and details for the merger will depend upon legal requirements and a variety of other factors, including the number of shares acquired by the purchaser pursuant to the offer. although parent and the purchaser have agreed to cause the merger to be consummated on the terms described above, there can be no assurance as to the timing of the merger. appraisal rights. holders of shares do not have dissenters' rights as a result of the offer. however, if the merger is consummated, holders of shares may have certain rights pursuant to the provisions of section 262 of the dgcl to dissent and demand appraisal of, and to receive payment in cash of the fair value of, their shares. if the statutory procedures were complied with, such rights could lead to a judicial determination of the fair value required to be paid in cash to such dissenting holders for their shares. any such judicial determination of the fair value of shares could be based upon considerations other than or in addition to the offer price or the market value of the shares, including asset values and the investment value of the shares. the value so determined could be more or less than the offer price or the merger consideration. if any stockholder who demands appraisal under section 262 of the dgcl fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, as provided in the dgcl, the shares of such stockholder will be converted into the merger consideration in accordance with the merger agreement. a stockholder may withdraw a demand for appraisal by delivery to parent of a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and acceptance of the merger. failure to follow the steps required by section 262 of the dgcl for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. going private transactions. the merger would have to comply with any applicable federal law operative at the time of its consummation. rule 13e-3 under the exchange act is applicable to certain "going private" transactions. the purchaser does not believe that rule 13e-3 will be applicable to the merger unless the merger is consummated more than one year after the termination of the offer. if applicable, rule 13e-3 would require, among other things, that certain financial information concerning the company and certain information relating to the fairness of the merger and the consideration offered to minority stockholders be filed with the commission and disclosed to minority stockholders prior to consummation of the merger. other matters. upon obtaining control of the company, parent plans to integrate the business and technology of the company with the parent's existing operations and estimates that, during the next twelve to twenty-four months, the combined companies will realize synergistic integration savings in excess of $20 million annually. there can, of course, be no assurance that parent will be able to achieve this result. parent will seek to realize these savings while maintaining and enhancing customer service and support. in the course of conducting its due diligence investigation of the company, parent has identified possible means of achieving these objectives including reduction of the costs associated with raw material purchases and consolidation of the sales, technical, engineering, administrative and manufacturing functions and production facilities of the combined companies. parent will be able to formulate more definitive plans in this regard only after it has an opportunity to conduct a detailed review of the company and its assets, operations, management and personnel. except as otherwise described in this offer to purchase, the purchaser and parent have no current plans or proposals that would relate to, or result in, any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the company, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation involving the company or any of its subsidiaries, a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries, any change in the company's capitalization or any other material change in the company's business, corporate structure or personnel. 25 28 the letter agreements; acknowledgments the following is a summary of certain provisions of the letter agreements, a copy of each of which has been filed as an exhibit to the schedule 14d-1 and is incorporated herein by reference. the letter agreements may be examined, and copies may be obtained, as set forth in section 9 above. such summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the forms of letter agreements. the parent has also entered into a letter agreement with each principal stockholder. each letter agreement contains a representation by the principal stockholder as to his beneficial ownership of a specified number of shares (including outstanding options to purchase shares). each principal stockholder has agreed to validly tender into the offer, and not withdraw, all shares beneficially owned by him, not to sell, transfer or grant any voting rights, with respect to, any of his shares and not to purchase additional shares while the merger agreement is in effect. each of the principal stockholders has also agreed to vote his shares in favor of the merger and against any action or arrangement which would interfere with the successful consummation of the merger and has executed and delivered to purchaser an irrevocable proxy to this effect. the principal stockholders have also agreed not to solicit or encourage the making of any other proposal intended to lead to the acquisition of their shares or any other extraordinary transaction involving the company and to notify the parent if any inquiry or solicitation is made to them concerning any such transaction. the parent has agreed to indemnify each of the principal stockholders from and against any and all claims by third parties, judgments, fines, penalties, liabilities, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be asserted against them or incurred by them in connection with their entering into the letter agreement or their compliance with the terms hereof, provided that such indemnity would not protect them against (i) any violations of law (other than violations alleged to have occurred as a result of their compliance with the terms and conditions of the letter agreement) or (ii) any breaches by them of their commitments in the letter agreement. the letter agreements will remain in effect until the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are successfully completed or until the merger agreement is terminated by parent or the company in accordance with its terms. each of james l. sadler and john h. sadler have delivered an acknowledgment to purchaser to the effect that certain provisions of the agreement and plan of merger relating to the merger of moline paint manufacturing co. into a subsidiary of the company providing for the payment of certain contingent amounts to him will terminate upon the purchase of his shares pursuant to the offer or merger. 13. dividends and distributions if on or after the date of the merger agreement, the company should (i) split, combine or otherwise change the shares or its capitalization, (ii) issue or sell any additional securities of the company or otherwise cause an increase in the number of outstanding securities of the company (except for shares issuable upon the exercise of employee stock options outstanding on the date of the merger agreement) or (iii) acquire currently outstanding shares or otherwise cause a reduction in the number of outstanding shares, then, without prejudice to the purchaser's rights under sections 1 and 14, the purchaser in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of the merger agreement, may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the offer price and other terms of the offer. if, on or after the date of the merger agreement, the company should declare or pay any dividend on the shares or make any distribution (including, without limitation, cash dividends (except that the company will be allowed to pay normal quarterly cash dividends for the first quarter of 1996 in the amount of $.09 per share payable on or about march 21, 1996 to stockholders of record or march 7, 1996), the issuance of additional shares pursuant to a stock dividend or stock split, the issuance of other securities or the issuance of rights for the purchase of

remittance and subject to applicable law, the purchaser will be entitled to all rights and privileges as owner of any such dividend, distribution or right and may withhold the entire offer price or deduct from the offer price the amount or value thereof, as determined by the purchaser in its sole discretion. section 7.1 of the merger agreement prohibits the company from taking any of the

the purchaser in accordance with its terms; or (c) the representations or warranties of the company contained in the merger agreement shall not be true and correct when made or on the expiration date

any action or inaction by parent or the purchaser) giving rise to any such conditions and, except as provided in the merger agreement, may be waived by parent or the purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion in each case subject to the terms of the merger agreement. the failure by parent or the purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 15. certain legal matters; regulatory approvals based on a review of publicly available filings made by the company with the commission and other publicly available information concerning the company, neither the purchaser nor parent is aware of any license or regulatory permit that appears to be material to the business of the company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that might be adversely affected by the purchaser's acquisition of shares as contemplated herein or of any approval or other action, except as otherwise described in this section 15, by any governmental entity that would be required for the acquisition or ownership of shares by the purchaser as contemplated herein. should any such approval or other action be required, the purchaser and parent currently contemplate that such approval or other action will be sought. while the purchaser does not presently intend to delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for shares tendered pursuant to the offer pending the outcome of any such matter, there can be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial conditions or that failure to obtain any such approval or other action might not result in consequences adverse to the company's business or that certain parts of the company's business might not have to be disposed of if such approvals were not obtained or such other actions were not taken. the purchaser's obligations under the offer to accept for payment and 28 31 pay for shares are subject to certain conditions including conditions relating to certain of the legal matters discussed in this section 15. see section 14. state takeover laws. a number of states throughout the united states have enacted takeover statutes that purport, in varying degrees, to be applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations that are incorporated or have assets, stockholders, executive offices or places of business in such states. in edgar v. mite corp., the supreme court of the united states held that the illinois business takeover act, which involved state securities laws that made the takeover of certain corporations more difficult, imposed a substantial burden on interstate commerce and therefore was unconstitutional. in cts corp. v. dynamics corp. of america, however, the supreme court of the united states held that a state may, as a matter of corporate law and, in particular, those laws concerning corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquirer from voting on the affairs of a target corporation without prior approval of the remaining stockholders, provided that such laws were applicable only under certain conditions. section 203 of the dgcl limits the ability of a delaware corporation to engage in business combinations with "interested stockholders" (defined as any beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation) unless, among other things, the corporation's board of directors has given its prior approval to either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an "interested stockholder." the company's board of directors has approved the merger agreement, the purchaser's acquisition of shares pursuant to the offer and the letter agreements and, therefore, section 203 of dgcl is inapplicable to the merger and the letter agreements. based on information supplied by the company, the purchaser does not believe that any state takeover statutes purport to apply to the offer or the merger. neither the purchaser nor parent has currently complied with any state takeover statute or regulation. the purchaser reserves the right to challenge the applicability or validity of any state law purportedly applicable to the offer or the merger and nothing in this offer to purchase or any action taken in connection with the offer or the merger is intended as a waiver of such right. if it is asserted that any state takeover statute is applicable to the offer or the merger and an appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the offer or the merger, the purchaser might be required to file certain information with, or to receive approvals from, the relevant state authorities, and the purchaser might be unable to accept for payment or pay for shares tendered pursuant to the offer, or be delayed in consummating the offer or the merger. in such case, the purchaser may not be obliged to accept for payment or pay for any shares tendered pursuant to the offer. antitrust. under the provisions of the hsr act applicable to the offer, the purchase of shares under the offer may be consummated following the expiration of a 15-calendar day waiting period following the filing by parent of a notification and report form with respect to the offer, unless parent receives a request for additional information or documentary material from the antitrust division of the department of justice (the "antitrust division") or the federal trade commission (the "ftc") or unless early termination of the waiting period is granted. parent has made such filing. if, within the initial 15-day waiting period, either the antitrust division or the ftc requests additional information or material from parent concerning the offer, the waiting period will be extended and would expire at 11:59 p.m., new york city time, on the tenth calendar day after the date of substantial compliance by parent with such request. only one extension of the waiting period pursuant to a request for additional information is authorized by the hsr act. thereafter, such waiting period may be extended only by court order or with the consent of parent. in practice, complying with a request for additional information or material can take a significant amount of time. in addition, if the antitrust division or the ftc raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction, the parties frequently engage in negotiations with the relevant governmental agency concerning possible means of addressing those issues and may agree to delay consummation of the transaction while such negotiations continue. the merger would not require an additional filing under the hsr act if the purchaser owns 50% or more of the outstanding shares at the time of the merger or if the merger occurs within one year after the hsr act waiting period applicable to the offer expires or is terminated. the ftc and the antitrust division frequently scrutinize the legality under the antitrust laws of the transactions such as the purchaser's proposed acquisition of the company. at any time before or after the 29 32 purchaser's purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, the antitrust division or ftc could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer or the consummation of the merger or seeking the divestiture of shares acquired by the purchaser or the divestiture of substantial assets of parent or its subsidiaries, or the company or its subsidiaries. private parties may also bring legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. there can be no assurance that a challenge to the offer on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, of the results thereof. federal reserve board regulations. regulations g, u and x (the "margin regulations") of the federal reserve board restrict the extension or maintenance of credit for the purpose of buying or carrying margin stock, including the shares, if the credit is secured directly or indirectly by margin stock. such secured credit may not be extended or maintained in an amount that exceeds the maximum loan value of all the direct and indirect collateral securing the credit, including margin stock and other collateral. the security arrangements for the financing described in section 10 of this offer to purchase will be negotiated by parent and nbd. such financing may be directly or indirectly secured by the shares or other securities which constitute margin stock. pursuant to the margin regulations, the maximum loan value of margin stock is presently 50% of its current market value, which in the case of credit used to purchase securities, means the total cost of purchase of such securities. the loan value of collateral other than margin stock is the amount that a lender would in good faith lend against such collateral without regard to other loan or collateral arrangements such lender might have. it is parent's intention that all financing for the offer and the merger be in full compliance with the margin regulations, and parent believes that direct or indirect margin stock and other collateral having an aggregate loan value in excess of the entire amount of the financing will be available to comply fully with the margin regulations. investment canada act. the company conducts business in canada. the investment canada act governs the acquisition of control of canadian businesses by non-canadians, meaning generally individuals who are not canadians or business entities not ultimately controlled by canadians. depending on the size or nature of the canadian business acquired, the acquisition of control will require compliance with either a notification procedure or review procedure, and in the latter case, the acquisition will only be allowed if it is deemed to be of net benefit to canada. indirect acquisitions of canadian businesses with assets of between cdn. $5,000,000 and $50,000,000, where the assets of canadian businesses represent 50% or less of the value of the assets involved in the total international transaction, are subject only to the notification procedure. under amendments to the investment canada act related to the u.s./canada free trade agreement and the north american free trade agreement ("nafta"), indirect investments involving investors from countries participating in nafta are not reviewable. although not defined in the investment canada act, an indirect acquisition is the acquisition of control of a canadian business through the acquisition of control of its parent outside canada. as a result of nafta, and because the company has advised the purchaser that the assets of the company's canadian subsidiary represent less than 50% of the value of the total assets of the company and its subsidiaries, the review procedure is not applicable to the purchaser's acquisition of the shares. the purchaser intends to file a notice of its acquisition of shares with the appropriate canadian governmental agency and to seek approval of such acquisition, if required. foreign laws. the company and certain of its subsidiaries conduct business in other foreign countries where regulatory filings or approvals may be required in connection with the consummation of the offer and the merger. certain of such filings, if required, may not be completed and certain of such approvals, if required, may not be obtained, prior to the expiration of the offer. however, there is no present intention to delay the acceptance for payment of or the payment for shares pursuant to the offer or consummation of the merger pending the completion of such filings and obtaining such approvals. there is no assurance that any such approvals would be obtained or that adverse consequences to parent's or the company's business might not result from a failure to obtain such approvals or conditions that might be imposed in connection therewith. 30 33 16. fees and expenses except as described below, neither the purchaser nor parent will pay any fees or commissions to any broker or dealer or other person in connection with the solicitation of tenders of shares pursuant to the offer. brokers, dealers, banks and trust companies will be reimbursed by the purchaser upon request for customary mailing and handling expenses incurred by them in forwarding material to their customers. a.g. edwards & sons, inc. has been retained as a financial advisor to parent and will be paid an aggregate fee of $1,250,000 if the acquisition by parent of the company is completed or a time and effort fee of $125,000 if the acquisition is not completed. a.g. edwards & sons, inc. will also be reimbursed for its out-of-pocket expenses (including legal fees) and will be indemnified in connection with certain liabilities in connection with its engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws. the purchaser has retained morrow & co., inc. to act as the information agent and first chicago trust company of new york to act as the depositary in connection with the offer. the information agent and the depositary each will receive reasonable and customary compensation for their services, be reimbursed for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses in connection therewith, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws. 17. miscellaneous the offer is not being made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) holders of shares in any jurisdiction in which the making of the offer or the acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. neither the purchaser nor parent is aware of any jurisdiction in which the making of the offer or the tender of shares in connection therewith would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. to the extent the purchaser or parent becomes aware of any state law that would limit the class of offerees in the offer, the purchaser will amend the offer and, depending on the timing of such amendment, if any, will extend the offer to provide adequate dissemination of such information to holders of shares prior to the expiration of the offer. in any jurisdiction the securities, blue sky or other laws of which require the offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the offer is being made on behalf of the purchaser by one or more registered brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction. no person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation on behalf of the purchaser or parent not contained herein or in the letter of transmittal and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized. the purchaser and parent have filed with the commission the schedule 14d-1 pursuant to rule 14d-3 under the exchange act, furnishing certain additional information with respect to the offer. in addition, the company has filed with the commission the schedule 14d-9 pursuant to rule 14d-9 under the exchange act, setting forth its recommendation with respect to the offer and the reasons for such recommendation and furnishing certain additional related information. such schedules and any amendments thereto, including exhibits, should be available for inspection and copies should be obtainable in the manner set forth in sections 8 and 9 (except that they will not be available at the regional offices of the commission). lp acquisition corporation march 8, 1996 31 34 schedule i directors and executive officers of parent the name, business address, present

to backup withholding of federal income tax. if a tendering stockholder is subject to backup withholding, he or she must cross out item (2) of the certification box on substitute form w-9. failure to provide the information on substitute form w-9 may subject the tendering stockholder to 31% federal income tax withholding on the payment of the purchase price. if the tendering stockholder has not

federal tax law, a stockholder whose tendered shares are accepted for payment is required to provide the depositary (as payor) with such stockholder's correct tin on substitute form w-9 below. if such stockholder is an individual, the tin is such stockholder's social security number. if the depositary is not provided with the correct tin or an adequate basis for exemption, the stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the internal revenue service. in addition, payments that are made to such stockholder with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the offer may be subject to backup withholding in an amount equal to 31% of the gross proceeds resulting from the offer. certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting requirements. in order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt recipient, that stockholder must submit an irs form w-8, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status. such statements can be obtained from the depositary. see the enclosed "guidelines for certification of taxpayer identification number on substitute form w-9" for additional instructions. if backup withholding applies, the depositary is required to withhold 31% of any payments made to the stockholder. backup withholding is not an additional tax. rather, the tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. if withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the internal revenue service. purpose of substitute form w-9 to prevent backup withholding on payments that are made to a stockholder with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the

subject to backup withholding. what number to give the depositary the stockholder is required to give the depositary the social security number or employer identification number of the record owner of the shares. if the shares are in more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed "guidelines for certification of taxpayer identification number on substitute form w-9" for additional guidance on which number to report. if the tendering stockholder has not been issued a tin and has applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near future, he or she should write "applied for" in the space provided for the tin in part i, sign and date the substitute form w-9 and sign and date the certificate of awaiting taxpayer identification number. if "applied for" is written in part i and the depositary is not provided with a tin within 60 days, the depositary will withhold 31% of all payments of the purchase price until a tin is provided to the

withholding." payments that could be subject to backup withholding include interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee compensation, and certain payments from fishing boat operators, but do not include real estate transactions. if you give the requester your correct tin, make the appropriate certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return, your payments will not be subject to backup withholding. payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if: (1) you do not furnish your tin to the requester, or (2) the irs notifies the requester that you furnished an incorrect tin, or (3) you are notified by the irs that you are subject to backup withholding because you failed to report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only), or (4) you do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup withholding under 3 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only), or (5) you do not certify your tin. this applies only to reportable interest, dividend, broker, or barter exchange accounts opened after 1983, or broker accounts considered inactive in 1983. except as explained in 5 above, other reportable payments are subject to backup withholding only if 1 or 2 above applies. certain

associated right), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated march 8, 1996 (the "offer to purchase"), and in the related letter of transmittal (which, together with any supplements or amendments, collectively constitute the "offer"). unless the context otherwise requires, all references to shares herein and in the offer to purchase shall include the rights and all references to the rights shall include all benefits that may inure to holders of the rights pursuant to the rights agreement, including the right to receive any payment due upon the redemption of the rights. ================================================================================ the offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on thursday, april 4, 1996, unless the offer is extended. ================================================================================ 2 the offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date (as defined in the offer to purchase) that number of shares that would represent at least a majority of all outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis (the "minimum condition"). three stockholders of the company beneficially holding approximately 48% of the outstanding shares, on a fully diluted basis, have entered into agreements with parent pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to tender their shares pursuant to the offer as more fully described herein. the offer is being made pursuant to a merger agreement, dated as of march 4, 1996 (the "merger agreement"), among parent, the purchaser and the company. the merger agreement provides that, among other things, the purchaser will make the offer and that following the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with relevant provisions of the delaware general corporation law, the purchaser will be merged with and into the company (the "merger"). following consummation of the merger, the company will continue as the surviving corporation and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent. at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), each share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by (i) parent or the purchaser or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of parent or purchaser or in the treasury of the company or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the company or (ii) stockholders, if any, who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights in accordance with the delaware general corporation law) will be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the price per share paid in the offer (without interest). as referenced above, parent has entered into agreements (each, a "letter agreement") with the three largest stockholders of the company (the "principal stockholders"). pursuant to the letter agreements, each principal stockholder has agreed, among other things, to validly tender in the offer, and not withdraw, all shares beneficially owned by him, not to sell, transfer or grant any voting rights with respect to any of his shares and not to purchase additional shares while the merger agreement is in effect. each principal stockholder has also agreed to vote his shares in favor of the merger and against any action or arrangement which would interfere with the successful consummation of the merger and has executed and delivered to parent an irrevocable proxy to this effect. the letter agreements cover 4,952,020 shares (including presently exercisable options to acquire 7,880 shares) in the aggregate owned by the principal stockholders, representing approximately 48% of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. the letter agreements will remain in effect until the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are successfully completed or until the merger agreement is terminated by parent or the company in accordance with its terms. the board of directors of the company unanimously approved the offer and the merger, determined that the offer and the merger are fair to the stockholders of the company and are in the best interests of the stockholders of the company and, subject to -2- 3 the fiduciary duties of the board, recommends acceptance of the offer and approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by the stockholders of the company. the offer is subject to certain conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, including satisfaction of the minimum condition and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the purchaser's acquisition of shares pursuant to the offer under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended. subject to the terms of the merger agreement, if any such condition is not satisfied, the purchaser may terminate the offer and return all tendered shares to tendering stockholders; extend the offer and, subject to withdrawal rights as set forth in the offer to purchase, retain all such shares until the expiration of the offer as so extended; or delay acceptance for payment of or payment for shares, subject to applicable law, until satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the offer and subject to the right of the purchaser to extend the offer as set forth in the offer to purchase. the purchaser may unilaterally waive any of the conditions (except the minimum condition) to the offer in whole or in part at any time in its sole discretion. the purchaser reserves the right, at any time or from time to time in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, to extend the period of time during which the offer is open by giving oral or written notice of such extension to first chicago trust company of new york (the "depositary"). any such extension will be followed as promptly as practicable by a public announcement thereof no later than 9:00 a.m., new york city time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled date on which the offer was to expire. during any such extension, all shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the offer, subject to the right of a tendering stockholder to withdraw such stockholder's shares. for purposes of the offer, the purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted for payment, and thereby purchased, shares validly tendered to the purchaser and not withdrawn as, if and when purchaser gives oral or written notice to the depositary of its acceptance of such shares for payment pursuant to the offer. payment for shares purchased pursuant to the offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the depositary, which shall act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payment from the purchaser and transmitting payment to validly tendering stockholders. under no circumstances will interest on the purchase price for shares be paid by the purchaser. in all cases, payment for shares purchased pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of certificates for such shares (or a confirmation of book-entry transfer of such shares into the depositary's account at one of the book-entry transfer facilities (as defined in, and pursuant to the procedure set forth in, the offer to purchase)), a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof) with any required signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message (as defined in the offer to purchase) and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal. -3- 4 tenders of shares made pursuant to the offer are irrevocable, except that shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to 12:00 midnight, new york city time on thursday, april 4, 1996 (or such later date as may apply in case the offer is extended in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement) and, unless theretofore accepted for payment as provided in the offer to purchase, withdrawn at any time after may 6, 1996. to be effective, a written, telegraphic or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the depositary at one of its addresses set forth in the offer to purchase and must specify the name of the person having tendered the shares to be withdrawn, the number of shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of the shares to be withdrawn, if different from the name of the person who tendered the shares. if certificates for shares have been delivered or otherwise identified to the depositary, then prior to the physical release of such certificates, the serial numbers shown on such certificates must be submitted to the depositary and, unless such shares have been tendered by an eligible institution (as defined in the offer to purchase), the signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an eligible institution or a recognized member of a medallion signature guaranty program. if shares have been delivered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer as set forth in the offer to purchase, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the account at the appropriate book-entry transfer facility to be credited with the withdrawn shares and otherwise comply with such book-entry transfer facility's procedures. withdrawals of tenders of shares may not be rescinded, and any shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the offer. however, withdrawn shares may be retendered by again following one of the procedures for tendering shares described in the offer to purchase at any time prior to the expiration date. all questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be determined by the purchaser, in its sole discretion, whose determination will be final and binding. the
