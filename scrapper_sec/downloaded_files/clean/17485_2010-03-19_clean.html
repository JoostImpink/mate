a registration statement at such time or (b)&#160;it is in the best interests of the company to suspend sales under such registration at such time.&#160;&#160;upon receipt of such notice, the investor shall immediately discontinue any sales of registrable securities pursuant to such registration until the investor is advised in writing by the company that the current prospectus or amended prospectus, as applicable, may be used.&#160;&#160;in no event, however, shall this right be exercised to suspend sales beyond the period during which (in the good faith determination of the company&#8217;s board of directors) the failure to require such suspension would be materially detrimental to the company.&#160;&#160;the company&#8217;s rights under this section 6(d) may be exercised for a period of no more than twenty (20) trading days at a time and not more than three times in any twelve-month period, without such suspension being considered as part of an event payment determination.&#160;&#160;immediately after the end of any suspension period under this section 6(d) , the company shall take all necessary actions (including filing any required supplemental prospectus) to restore the effectiveness of the applicable registration statement and the ability of the investor to publicly resell their registrable securities pursuant to such effective registration statement. &#160;

provided , however , that the company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;cooperate with the investor to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing registrable securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to a registration statement, which certificates shall be free, to the extent permitted by this agreement and under law, of all restrictive legends, and to enable such certificates to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any the investor may reasonably request. &#160; (j)&#160;&#160;upon the occurrence of any event described in section 6.2(c)(vii ), as promptly as reasonably possible, prepare a supplement or amendment, including a post-effective amendment, to the registration statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered, neither the registration statement nor such prospectus will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. &#160; (k)&#160;cooperate with any reasonable due diligence investigation undertaken by the investor in connection with the sale of registrable securities, including, without limitation, by making available documents and information;

&#160; (b)&#160; indemnification by investor .&#160;&#160;the investor shall indemnify and hold harmless the company and its directors, officers, agents and employees to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all losses (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment not subject to appeal or review) arising solely out of any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement, any prospectus, or any form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or relating to any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, but only to the extent that (i) such untrue statements or omissions are based solely upon information regarding the investor furnished to the company by the investor in writing expressly for use therein, or to the extent that such information relates to the investor or the investor&#8217;s proposed method of distribution of registrable securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by the investor expressly for use in the registration statement (it being understood that the information provided by the investor to the company in exhibits &#160; b-1 and b-2 and the plan of distribution set forth on exhibit d , as the same may be modified by the investor and other information provided by the investor to the company in or pursuant to the transaction documents constitutes information reviewed and expressly approved by the investor in writing expressly for use in the registration statement), such prospectus or such form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.&#160;&#160;in no event shall the liability of any selling investor hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by the investor upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. &#160; -31- &#160; (c)&#160; conduct of indemnification proceedings .&#160;&#160;if any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an &#8220; indemnified party &#8221;), such indemnified party shall promptly notify the person from whom indemnity is sought (the &#8220; indemnifying party &#8221;) in writing, and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, that the failure of any indemnified party to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the indemnifying party. &#160; an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless:&#160;&#160;(i)&#160;the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; or (ii)&#160;the indemnifying party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party in any such proceeding; or (iii)&#160;the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party).&#160;&#160;it shall be understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such proceeding (including separate proceedings that have been or will be consolidated before a single judge) be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all indemnified parties, which firm shall be appointed by a majority of the indemnified parties.&#160;&#160;the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. &#160; all reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnified party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this section) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within 20 trading days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided, that the indemnifying party may require such indemnified party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). &#160; -32- &#160; (d)&#160; contribution .&#160;&#160;if a claim for indemnification under section 6.4(a ) or&#160; (b ) is unavailable to an indemnified party (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.&#160;&#160;the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission.&#160;&#160;the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 6.4(c ), any reasonable attorneys&#8217; or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this section was available to such party in accordance with its terms. &#160; the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 6.4(d ) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the provisions of this section 6.4(d ), the investor shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by the investor from the sale of the registrable securities subject to the proceeding exceed the amount of any damages that the investor has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.&#160;&#160;no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f ) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160; the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this section 6.4 are in addition to any liability that the indemnifying parties may have to the indemnified parties. &#160; 6.5&#160; dispositions .&#160;&#160;the investor agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act as applicable to it in connection with sales of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement and shall sell its registrable securities in accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in the prospectus.&#160;&#160;the investor further agrees that, upon receipt of a notice from the company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in sections 6.2(c)(v ), (vi ) or (vii ), the investor will discontinue disposition of such registrable securities under the registration statement until the investor is advised in writing by the company that the use of the prospectus, or amended prospectus, as applicable, may be resumed.&#160;&#160;the company may provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the provisions of this paragraph. the investor agrees that the removal of the restrictive legend from certificates representing securities as set forth in this section 4.1 is predicated upon the company&#8217;s reliance that the investor will comply with the provisions of this subsection. both the company and the transfer agent, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, may rely on this subsection. &#160; -33- &#160; 6.6&#160; no piggyback on registrations .&#160;&#160;neither the company nor any of its security holders (other than the investor in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the company in the registration statement other than the registrable securities. &#160; 6.7&#160; piggy-back registrations .&#160;&#160;(a) if at any time during the effectiveness period there is not an effective registration statement covering all of the registrable securities and the company shall determine to prepare and file with the sec a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the securities act of any of its equity securities, other than (i)&#160;&#160;pursuant to the millennium registration agreement and (ii) on form s-4 or form s-8 (each as promulgated under the securities act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans, then the company shall send to the investor not then eligible to sell all of their registrable securities under rule 144 in a three-month period, written notice of such determination and if, within ten days after receipt of such notice, any the investor shall so request in writing, the company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such registrable securities the investor requests to be registered. &#160; (b)&#160;notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, in connection with any underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter(s) thereof shall impose a limitation on the number of shares of common stock which may be included in the registration statement because, in such underwriter(s)&#8217; judgment, marketing or other factors dictate such limitation is necessary to facilitate public distribution, then the company shall be obligated to include in such registration statement only such limited portion of the registrable securities with respect to which the investor has requested inclusion hereunder as the underwriter shall permit; provided , however , that (i) the company shall not exclude any registrable securities unless the company has first excluded all outstanding securities, the holders of which are not contractually entitled to inclusion of such securities in such registration statement or are not contractually entitled to pro rata inclusion with the registrable securities and (ii) after giving effect to the immediately preceding proviso, any such exclusion of registrable securities shall be made pro rata among the investor and the holders of other securities having the contractual right to inclusion of their securities in such registration statement by reason of demand registration rights, in proportion to the number of registrable securities or other securities, as applicable, sought to be included by the investor or other holder. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;if an offering in connection with which the investor is entitled to registration under this section 6.7 is an underwritten offering, then the investor whose registrable securities are included in such registration statement shall, unless otherwise agreed by the company, offer and sell such registrable securities in an underwritten offering using the same underwriter or underwriters and, subject to the provisions of this agreement, on the same terms and conditions as other shares of common stock included in such underwritten offering and shall enter into an underwriting agreement in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company and the underwriter or underwriters. &#160;

provided that no such termination will affect the right of any party to sue for any breach by the other party (or parties). &#160; 7.2&#160; fees and expenses .&#160;&#160;except as expressly set forth in the transaction documents to the contrary, each party shall pay the fees and expenses of its advisers, counsel, accountants and other experts, if any, and all other expenses incurred by such party incident to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this agreement.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the foregoing, the company agrees to pay the fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel to the investor, not to exceed $25,000.&#160;&#160;the company shall pay all transfer agent fees, stamp taxes and other taxes and duties levied in connection with the sale and issuance of the applicable securities. &#160;
