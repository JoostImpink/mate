12 - an amendment to the issuer's employee stock incentive plan; - the conversion by ufi and jp morgan (the "cd holders") of the series a and series b 7.75% convertible debentures due 2010 of the issuer, plus a certain amount of the accrued and unpaid interest thereon (the "cds"), for subordinate voting shares of the issuer; - the conversion by telesystem of its multiple voting shares of the issuer into subordinate voting shares of the issuer; and - the redesignation of all subordinate voting shares of the issuer into a newly issued class of "common shares" of the issuer (which common shares will be registered under section 12(g) of the u.s. securities exchange act of 1934, as amended). esd issuer bid pursuant to the esd issuer bid, on november 29, 2001, the issuer offered to purchase all of its issued and outstanding esds for an amount of cdn$300 cash, without interest, for each cdn$1,000 principal amount at maturity of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, each esd tendered. in conjunction with the esd issuer bid, the issuer has requested that esd holders consent to the proposed amendments (the "proposed amendments") to the indenture governing the esds (the "existing indenture"). esd holders tendering their esds under the esd issuer bid will be deemed to have consented to the proposed amendments with respect to such tendered esds. the issuer is offering to each esd holder who does not tender its esds in the esd issuer bid, but who validly consents to the proposed amendments and does not revoke such consent on or prior to the expiration date (as defined below), the consent fee of cdn$100 for each cdn$1,000 principal amount at maturity of esds held by such esd holder. such consent fee will be payable once the proposed amendments become effective. if an esd holder's consent is either not properly delivered or is revoked on or prior to the expiration date, such holder will not receive the consent fee, even if the proposed amendments become effective as to all esds that are not purchased under the esd issuer bid. the proposed amendments will be effected by a supplemental indenture to the existing indenture, to be executed following the expiration date, if the consents of esd holders representing at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding esds have been obtained (the "requisite consents"). the supplemental indenture will become effective concurrently with the full payment of the purchase price for the deposited esds and of the consent fee. the purposes of the proposed amendments are, among others, to: (i) reduce the principal amount at maturity of each esd from cdn$1,000 to cdn$250 and make the 7.00% cash coupon calculated on the basis of the newly defined principal amount; (ii) modify the semi-annual 7.00% cash coupon by suspending interest during the period from august 15, 2001 until the date the supplemental indenture becomes effective, by postponing the next cash payment date to june 30, 2002 and by fixing cash payment dates thereafter on june 30 and december 31 of each year; (iii) extend the maturity date of each esd until december 31, 2006; (iv) modify the options of the esd holders to convert upon an event of default and of the issuer to pay at maturity the principal amount of the esds then outstanding (and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in the case of an event of default) in cash or in freely tradable subordinate voting 13 shares by making the number of subordinate voting shares issued in payment thereof equal to the amount payable divided by the greater of cdn$1.00 or 95% of the then current market price (as defined in the existing indenture) of the subordinate voting shares; and (v) reduce the conversion price from cdn$115.00 to cdn$4.40. the esd issuer bid, and the consent solicitation thereunder, will expire at 11:59 p.m. (montreal time), on wednesday, january 9, 2002, unless extended by the issuer (the "expiration date"). the issuer's obligation to accept and pay for esds deposited under the esd issuer bid is subject to, among other things: (i) the condition that the issuer receives the requisite consents to the proposed amendments; and (ii) the condition that the master and purchase agreement not be terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. the issuer's obligation to amend the existing indenture and to pay the consent fee is subject to the receipt by the issuer of the requisite consents to the proposed amendments and to the take up and payment by the issuer of the esds deposited hereunder. units issuer bid pursuant to the units issuer bid, on or about december 10, 2001, the issuer made an offer to the holders of its outstanding units to purchase all of its issued and outstanding units in exchange for 5.46 subordinate voting shares for each unit tendered. telesystem, caisse de depot et placement du quebec and all its subsidiaries, including cdpq (collectively "caisse"), and rogers telecommunications (quebec) inc. ("rogers") have agreed to tender their units in the units issuer bid. as of november 28, 2001, telesystem, caisse and rogers beneficially owned approximately 55.1% of all units currently outstanding. should an aggregate of 63.4% of the units currently outstanding be tendered in the units issuer bid, there will be less than us$100 million of units outstanding based on the purchase price of the units of cdn$9.05, converted using the applicable exchange rate. pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the units, if less than us$100 million of units, based on the purchase price of cdn$9.05, converted using the applicable exchange rate, are outstanding on june 30, 2002, all holders of the units then outstanding shall irrevocably be deemed to have exercised the option to exchange the units for 0.2 of a subordinate voting share per unit held. the units issuer bid will expire at 11:59 p.m. (montreal time), on monday, january 21, 2002, unless withdrawn or extended by the issuer. the units issuer bid is not subject to any minimum tender conditions; however, the issuer's obligation to take up and pay for units deposited under the units issuer bid is subject to, among other things: (i) the successful completion of the esd issuer bid in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof as described above and (ii) the condition that the master and purchase agreement not be terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. private placement the private placement contemplates the issuance by the issuer of us$90 million in the aggregate of special warrants to cdpq, telesystem and jpmp (bhca) for a purchase price per special warrant of us$0.6124765. 14 on december 14, 2002, the issuer will issue in the first tranche 9,951,402, 5,695,456 and 8,843,877 special warrants to cdpq, telesystem and jpmp (bhca), respectively, for an aggregate purchase price us$15 million. subject, among other things, to the successful completion of the esd issuer bid pursuant to the terms thereof as described above and the credit agreement amendment, the issuer will issue in the second tranche 49,757,011, 28,477,284 and 44,219,383 special warrants to cdpq, telesystem and jpmp (bhca), respectively, for an aggregate purchase price us$75 million. if the esd issuer bid is successfully completed pursuant to the terms thereof as described above, each holder of special warrants shall be entitled, for no additional consideration, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of special warrants, to receive (subject to certain antidilution adjustments) (i) one subordinate voting share for each special warrant exercised or (ii) if telesystem is a holder of multiple voting shares at the time it exercises its special warrants, a maximum of 8,108,170 special warrants held by telesystem shall entitle it to one multiple voting share for each special warrant exercised; provided, that such special warrants shall not entitle telesystem to acquire more multiple voting shares than needed to maintain, rather than increase, the percentage voting rights associated with the multiple voting shares held by telesystem on november 28, 2001 as a result of the issuance of subordinate voting shares pursuant to the exercise of the special warrants or purchase warrants (as defined below). if the esd issuer bid is not successfully completed pursuant to the terms thereof as described above, each holder of special warrants shall be entitled, for no additional consideration, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of special warrants, to receive new convertible debentures of the issuer (the "new convertible debentures"). each new convertible debenture shall be issued in a face denomination of us$1,000 and integral multiples of us$1,000. the exercise of an aggregate of 1,633 special warrants shall be required to acquire each whole new convertible debenture. the new convertible debentures will be senior in rank to the cds and esds but junior to other indebtedness of the issuer, will carry an interest rate of 25% per year, and each us$1,000 in principal amount will be convertible at any time at the option of the holder into subordinate voting shares at the then market price for such shares. issuance of dividend warrants subject, among other things, to the successful completion of the esd issuer bid pursuant to the terms thereof as described above and the credit agreement amendment, the issuer shall declare a dividend to the outstanding holders of multiple voting shares and subordinate voting shares of record as of the dividend record date for such dividend, for each such share held, of one warrant to acquire one additional subordinate voting share at a price equal to the canadian dollar equivalent of us$1.00, using the official spot rate of exchange quoted by the bank of canada on the last business day prior to the dividend record date. the issuance of the dividend warrants will not take into account the issuance of the special warrants, the purchase warrants or the cd conversion (as defined below). 15 conversion of the convertible debentures subject, among other things, to the successful completion of the esd issuer bid and units issuer bid pursuant to the terms described above and the credit agreement amendment, and simultaneously with the conversion of all multiple voting shares held by telesystem into subordinate voting shares (as described below), the cd holders have agreed to convert (the "cd conversion") the outstanding us$300 million principal amount of the cds, plus the accrued and unpaid interest of us$11.6 million due september 9, 2001 (but excluding the interest on such us$11.6 million of accrued and unpaid interest, which shall be paid by the issuer to the cd holders in cash, and the interest accruing since september 9, 2001, which, subject to certain conditions, shall be cancelled), into the number of subordinate voting shares having a aggregate value of us$94.6 million at a per share price of us$0.6124765. on november 29, 2001, the issuer, ufi, jp morgan and the bank of nova scotia trust company of new york, as trustee, entered into an amendment to the cd indenture (the "second amending agreement") (a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit 4 and is incorporated by reference into this item 6) to amend the terms of the cd indenture, which second amending agreement provides, among other things, for the cd conversion. issuance of the purchase warrants subject, among other things, to the cd conversion and certain antidilution adjustments, the issuer shall issue to ufi purchase warrants entitling ufi to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 subordinate voting shares (or common shares, as applicable) at a price equal to us$1.00 per share from the issue date thereof until september 30, 2002. conversion of the multiple voting shares subject to the successful completion of the esd issuer bid and the units issuer bid pursuant to the terms thereof as described above and the credit agreement amendment, and simultaneously with the cd conversion, telesystem will convert each of its multiple voting shares into one subordinate voting share of the issuer. redesignation of the subordinate voting shares/amend issuer stock incentive plans subject to the successful completion of the esd issuer bid and the units issuer bid pursuant to the terms thereof as described above and the credit agreement amendment, the issuer shall approve at any time prior to the calling of the issuer's next annual meeting of shareholders, amendments to the issuer's constituting documents in order to redesignate all of its subordinate voting shares as "common shares" and submit said amendments and, as required under applicable laws or by regulatory authorities, certain amendments to be made to the issuer's stock incentive plans, to the shareholders of the issuer for approval, in accordance with applicable securities laws and the issuer's governing statute, and in connection therewith, the issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of such amendments. each of telesystem, cdpq, ufi and jp morgan has covenanted and agreed to vote, or to cause to be voted, its subordinate voting shares and, in the case of telesystem, its multiple voting shares (including all such shares now owned or hereafter acquired) in favor of (i) the amendments to the issuer's constituting documents providing for the redesignation of 16 subordinate voting shares as "common shares", and (ii) the amendments to the issuer's employee stock incentive plans. override adjustment upon potential group determination notwithstanding the provisions of the master and purchase agreement to the contrary, if the issuer's board of directors, acting with the benefit of legal counsel, determines in a timely manner that the issuance of the special warrants and the purchase warrants, the issuance of the underlying securities upon exercise thereof, any conversion of the cds, any conversion of new convertible debentures, and/or the issuance of subordinate voting shares pursuant to the units issuer bid, when combined with the acquisition or continuing ownership of any other securities of the issuer by ufi, cdpq, jp morgan and telesystem (each, an "investor", and together, the "investors") or any of their affiliates (whether pursuant to the master and purchase agreement or otherwise) would be likely to (i) result in any combination of the investors and their affiliates (other than telesystem) (the "non-exempt purchasers") being considered a "group" within the meaning of sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, such that certain provisions of the issuer's debt instruments pertaining to a change of control of the issuer may be triggered (a "potential group determination") or (ii) result in cdpq increasing its voting position in the issuer, as of november 28, 2001, by more than 10% (on a non diluted basis), then the non-exempt purchasers (in the case of (i) above) and cdpq (in the case of (ii) above) agree to accept, in lieu of a portion of any voting securities of the issuer which they are entitled to receive pursuant to the master and purchase agreement, non-voting preferred shares of the issuer ("non-voting preferred shares"). such non-voting preferred shares may be issuable upon exercise of the special warrants or the purchase warrants or at a later date in exchange for subordinate voting shares or common shares held by the non-exempt purchasers or cdpq, as the case may be (subject to any necessary regulatory approval). the aggregate amount of non-voting preferred shares to be issued shall be the amount necessary to enable the issuer to reasonably determine that either (i) a potential group determination shall not exist either at the time of the issuance or within a short period of time thereafter or (ii) cdpq shall not increase its voting position, as of the date hereof, by more than 10% (on a non diluted basis). for purposes of determining the number of non-voting preferred shares to be issued, it is the intent of the investors to ensure a reasonable cushion exists to protect against a potential group determination being triggered by variances in the number of subordinate voting shares owned by the investors and their affiliates (as well as persons who could be deemed to be part of the "group" under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) from time to time. any non-voting preferred shares issued shall be allocated among the non-exempt purchasers as determined (a) by agreement among the non-exempt purchasers within ten calendar days after receipt by the investors of notice from the issuer of a potential group determination or, failing such agreement, (b) by a committee of the issuer's board of directors consisting of those members not designated by any of the investors pursuant to the ira. any allocation under clause (b) above shall be made on a fair and equitable basis taking into account the preservation of the intended relative voting and economic ownership positions of each of the non-exempt purchasers in the issuer as of the date of consummation of all of the transactions contemplated by the master and purchase agreement and any other factors deemed relevant by such committee. 17 other matters pursuant to the ira (which is more fully described in item 4), the issuer is subject to the approval of either two thirds or three quarters of the votes cast by the members of the board present and eligible to vote for certain of its corporate decisions. in addition, if any of the investors, either individually or as part of a group (the "co-sale group") of two or more investors acting jointly and in concert (such individual investor or co-sale group member being the "co-sale offeree") proposes to transfer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, either voluntarily or involuntarily and with or without consideration shares ("transfer"), or receives an offer to transfer (that it wishes to accept), to any third party (the "co-sale offeror") shares of such investor that either alone, or together with any other co-sale offeree, represent more than 15% of the total equity securities of the issuer issued and outstanding as of the date of such offer, the co-sale offeree, either for itself or on behalf of the co-sale group, shall, notify the other investors of the material terms and conditions of such offer. no co-sale offeree shall transfer any shares to the co-sale offeror unless each investor (other than any co-sale offeree) who desires to do so is permitted to transfer its respective pro rata amount (based upon the aggregate number of voting securities of the issuer outstanding at such time and held by all investors) of the aggregate number of voting securities to which the co-sale offer relates. upon the completion of the recapitalization, including, without limitation, the successful completion of the esd issuer bid and consent request and the units issuer bid, it is expected that-jp morgan will significantly increase its beneficial ownership of the svs through (i) the purchase of the special warrants pursuant to the first and second tranches, (ii) the consummation of the cd conversion and (ii) the exercise of the dividend warrants, each subject to adjustments set forth in the master and purchase agreement (including without limitation, the issuance of the non-voting preferred shares to jp morgan instead of svs.) jp morgan disclaims beneficial ownership of any securities beneficially owened by each of ufi, cdpq and telesystem. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit 1 - joint filing agreement, dated

(d) subject to section 4.1(a), ufi shall receive, on the purchase warrant issue date, a warrant certificate executed by the issuer, evidencing the purchase warrants. section 4.2 prohibition of transfers of purchase warrants the purchase warrants shall be non-transferable by ufi except to one of its affiliates or to any purchaser, provided that, if to an affiliate, such affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms of this agreement and all relevant ancillary agreements. section 4.3 exercise of the purchase warrants the purchase warrants issued to ufi may be exercised from time to time, in whole or in part, subject to a minimum subscription of $3,000,000 of underlying securities being subscribed for on each exercise of purchase warrants during the purchase warrant period by delivery to the issuer of a notice in writing signed by an authorized representative of ufi in the form set forth in schedule 4.3 (the "purchase warrant notice"). ufi shall not exercise purchase warrants for any fractional underlying securities. subject to the foregoing minimum subscription for underlying securities, each purchase warrant notice shall specify the number of underlying securities with respect to which the purchase warrants are being exercised and include the time of closing, which shall be a business day and shall not be less than five (5) business days from the receipt by the issuer of the purchase warrant notice (each, a "purchase warrant closing date"). section 4.4 purchase warrant price the purchase warrant price payable by ufi to the issuer for each underlying security issued pursuant to the exercise of purchase warrants shall be $1.00 per underlying security subject to adjustment pursuant to section 4.6 and article 5 (the "purchase warrant price"). -20- section 4.5 completion (a) following each valid exercise of purchase warrants, the issuer shall, on each purchase warrant closing date, issue the number of underlying securities specified in the purchase warrant notice to ufi upon payment by ufi of the purchase warrant price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the issuer.

equal to 0.15. under no circumstances shall the issuer be obliged to issue any fractional underlying security upon the exercise of purchase warrants. article 5 adjustments to the underlying securities section 5.1 anti-dilution adjustment if at any time from the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the esd issuer bid closing date, if the esd indenture amendment has failed to occur on or prior to such date and (ii) the units issuer bid closing date, the issuer issues any (a) shares of its share capital; (b) warrants, options or other rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase any such shares; or (c) securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares or securities (the "equity securities") (other than equity securities issued by the issuer pursuant to any transactions contemplated in this agreement or under any stock incentive plans for its employees and directors contemplated in this agreement), at an average price which is less than the purchase price, then the number of underlying securities to be issued upon the exercise of the special warrants or the purchase warrants, as the case may be, whether such special warrants or purchase warrants have been exercised or not, shall be adjusted prior to the exercise thereof, or retroactively after the exercise thereof, by multiplying such number of underlying securities provided in section 2.2, section 2.8(a), section 2.8(d), section 4.1(a) or section 4.6, as the case may be, by the quotient of the purchase price over the average price. if any of the special warrants or the purchase warrants, as the case may be, have been exercised prior to this adjustment, the issuer shall issue to the persons who exercised the special warrants or the purchase warrants, as the case may be, the number of additional underlying securities, they would have been entitled to receive had the adjustment become effective prior to the exercise of their special warrants or purchase warrants. for the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that if there are multiple issuance transactions by the issuer in -21- the applicable period that involve equity securities being issued below the purchase price, then the provisions of this section 5.1 shall apply to each such issuance. section 5.2 reclassification, reorganization or amalgamation if at any time before the expiry time, in the case of the special warrants or before the expiry of the purchase warrant period, in the case of the purchase warrants, there is a reclassification of the shares or a capital reorganization of the issuer or a subdivision or consolidation of the shares or an amalgamation or merger of the issuer with or into any person, or a sale of all or substantially all the business or assets of the issuer to any other person or other entity or the payment by the issuer of a stock dividend, other than any such transactions that are contemplated in this agreement, the special warrant purchasers and ufi shall be entitled to receive and shall accept, upon the exercise of the special warrants or the purchase warrants, as the case may be, in lieu of the number of underlying securities contemplated in section 2.2, section 2.8(a), section 2.8(d), section 4.1(a) or section 4.6, as the case may be, the number of shares or other securities or property of the issuer or of the person resulting from such reclassification, reorganization, subdivision, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or payments, or to which such sale may be made, as the case may be, that the special warrant purchasers or ufi, as the case may be, would have been entitled to receive on such reclassification, capital reorganization, subdivision, consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, conveyance or payment, if, on the effective date thereof, the special warrant purchasers or ufi, as the case may be, had been the registered holder of the number of underlying securities so sought to be acquired. if determined appropriate by the special warrant purchasers or ufi, as the case may be, to give effect to or to evidence the provisions of this section, the issuer, its successor, or such purchasing person, as the case may be, shall, when becoming aware of any such reclassification, reorganization, subdivision, consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or payment, enter into an agreement which shall provide, to the extent possible, for the application of the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the special warrant purchasers or ufi, as the case may be, to the end that the provisions set forth in this agreement shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, with respect to any shares, other securities or property to which the special warrant purchasers or ufi, as the case may be, are entitled on the exercise of their special warrants or purchase warrants, as the case may be. section 5.3 override adjustment upon potential group determination anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if the issuer's board of directors, acting with the benefit of legal counsel, determines in a timely manner that the issuance of the special warrants and the purchase warrants, the issuance of underlying securities upon exercise thereof, any conversion of the convertible debentures, any conversion of new convertible debentures, and/or the issuance of subordinate voting shares pursuant to the units issuer bid, when combined with the acquisition or continuing ownership of any other securities of the issuer by the purchasers or any of their affiliates (whether pursuant to this agreement or otherwise) would be likely to (i) result in any combination of the purchasers and their affiliates (other than telesystem) (the "non-exempt purchasers") being considered a "group" within the meaning of sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the 1934 act such that certain provisions of the issuer's debt instruments pertaining to a change of control of the issuer may be triggered (a "potential group determination") or (ii) result in cdpq increasing its voting position in the -22- issuer, as of the date hereof, by more than 10% (on a non diluted basis), then the non-exempt purchasers (in the case of (i) above) and cdpq (in the case of (ii) above) agree to accept, in lieu of a portion of any voting securities of the issuer which they are entitled to receive pursuant to this agreement, non-voting preferred shares of the issuer having the terms described in schedule 5.3 ("non-voting preferred shares"). such non-voting preferred shares may be issuable upon exercise of the special warrants or the purchase warrants or at a later date in exchange for subordinate voting shares or common shares held by the non-exempt purchasers or cdpq, as the case may be, (subject to any necessary regulatory approval). the aggregate amount of non-voting preferred shares to be issued shall be the amount necessary to enable the issuer to reasonably determine that either (i) a potential group determination shall not exist either at the time of the issuance or within a short period of time thereafter or (ii) cdpq shall not increase its voting position, as of the date hereof, by more than 10% (on a non diluted basis). for purposes of determining the number of non-voting preferred shares to be issued, it is the intent of the parties to ensure a reasonable cushion exists to protect against a potential group determination being triggered by variances in the number of subordinate voting shares owned by the purchasers and their affiliates (as well as persons who could be deemed to be part of the "group" under the 1934 act) from time to time. any non-voting preferred shares issued shall be allocated among the non-exempt purchasers as determined (a) by agreement among the non-exempt purchasers within ten calendar days after receipt by the purchasers of notice from the issuer of a potential group determination or, failing such agreement, (b) by a committee of the issuer's board of directors consisting of those members not designated by any of the purchasers pursuant to the investors rights agreement. any allocation under clause (b) above shall be made on a fair and equitable basis taking into account the preservation of the intended relative voting and economic ownership positions of each of the non-exempt purchasers in the issuer as of the date of consummation of all of the transactions contemplated by this agreement and any other factors deemed relevant by such committee. section 5.4 dispute on adjustments if a dispute shall at any time arise with respect to the adjustments provided for in this article 5, such dispute shall be conclusively determined by the board of directors of the issuer, and, if requested by any purchaser, reviewed by a member of the investment dealers association of canada selected and determined by the board of directors acting reasonably to be independent of the issuer and the purchasers and any such determination of such member shall be binding upon the issuer and the purchasers. article 6 representations and warranties of the issuer
