schedule 6.11.1 holding not less than the requisite percentage of registrable shares demanding the company effect the registration under the 1933 act of any or all of their registrable shares, the

shares specified in the demand request (a "demand registration"). the company shall be obligated to effect only three (four, if shares are included in a registration statement in accordance with any agreement listed on schedule 6.1) demand registrations using form s-1 (or its successor form(s)) ("long-form demand registrations"), and shall not be obligated to effect any demand registrations other than long-form demand registrations that are made pursuant to demand requests made after the sixth anniversary of the closing date; however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, if, for any reason (other than the fault of the demanding shareholders), a long-form demand registration fails to become effective and to provide for the distribution of all the registrable shares specified in the demand request, or the effectiveness is not maintained for at least 120 days in accordance with section 6.4 or the company fails to perform all its obligations under this section 6.1 with respect to that long-form demand registration, the demanding shareholders shall thereafter continue to be entitled to the same number of long-form demand registrations in accordance with this section 6.1 to which they had been entitled immediately before the demand request that gave rise to that long-form demand registration. the holders of a majority of the registrable shares making a particular demand request may, at their option, elect (which election shall be included in the demand request) to make the demand registration underwritten, in which event, and subject to the rights of gkm under the agreement referred to on schedule 3.2.24, the holders of a majority of the registrable shares making the demand request shall be entitled to select the underwriter(s). 6.2 piggyback registration. if at any time on or before the 40th day following the sixth anniversary of the closing date the company determines or is requested or receives a demand (pursuant to an agreement binding

sale to the public of any of the registrable shares held by a purchaser, the company shall within 10 days thereafter give each purchaser notice of its intent to effect a registration, and, subject to sections 6.5 and 6.7, shall include in the registration all registrable shares held by each purchaser with respect to which the company shall have received a notice (a "piggyback request") specifying the number of registrable shares to be included within 30 days after the company shall have given each purchaser the notice pursuant to this section 6.2. 6.3 obligation of shareholder. any demand request or piggyback request (a "request") shall express the present intent to offer for sale to the public the number of registrable shares to be included in the registration statement and contain an undertaking reasonably to provide such information and materials and take such action as may be required to permit the company to comply with all applicable requirements of the sec and to obtain acceleration of the effective date of the registration statement. 6.4 obligations of the company. with respect to any registration statement referred to in section 6.1 or 6.2, the company shall: (a) use its best efforts to have the registration statement declared effective as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 120 days after the applicable request, and shall promptly notify each

to the registration statement becomes effective and (iii) of any request by the sec for any amendment or supplement to the registration statement or any prospectus relating to the registration statement or for addi- tional information; (b) make available for inspection by any underwriters participating in any planned disposition of registrable shares and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any purchaser or the underwriters all financial and other records reasonably necessary to permit them to demonstrate that they have conducted a reasonable investigation of matters described in the registration statement and cause the appropriate company officers to supply all such information reasonably requested by each purchaser, the underwriters or their agents; (c) use reasonable efforts to qualify, not later than the effective date of the registration statement, the registrable shares under such "blue sky" or other state securities laws as any purchaser or underwriter may reasonably request (it being understood, however, that the obligation under this section 6.4(c) shall not obligate the company to qualify as a foreign corporation or a dealer in securities or to execute or file any general consent to service of process under the law of any such jurisdiction where it is not otherwise subject); (d) furnish each purchaser and any underwriter such number of copies of the registration statement, each amendment to the registration statement, the prospectus included in each such registration statement and each amendment to each registration statement, each amendment or supplement to any prospectus and such other documents as the purchaser and any underwriter may request to facilitate the disposition of the registrable shares; (e) use best efforts to keep the registration statement in effect and current for at least 120 days from the effective date of the registration statement, and from time to time to amend or supplement the registration statement or the prospectus to the extent necessary to permit the completion of the sale or distribution of the registrable shares within that period in compliance with the 1933 act. if at any time the sec institutes or threatens to institute any proceeding for the purpose of issuing a stop order suspending the effectiveness of any such registration statement, the company shall promptly notify each purchaser and use best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or to obtain its withdrawal as soon as possible. the company shall promptly advise each purchaser of any order or communication of any public board or body addressed to the company suspending or threatening to suspend the qualification of any of the registrable shares for sale in any jurisdiction; and (f) insofar as the methods of distribution proposed to be used are not reflected in the last prospectus filed by the company as part of the registration statement or pursuant to rule 424 under the 1933 act, each purchaser shall promptly provide the company with a description of the method or methods of distribution of the registrable shares from time to time contemplated by that purchaser, and the company shall file any and all amendments and supplements necessary to include the description in the registration statement. 6.5 conditions to the obligations of the company. the company may postpone, for up to 90 days, the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it under this agreement, if, at the time it receives a request, the company would be required to prepare financial statements other than those it customarily prepares or the registration and offering would interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material corporate transaction or development involving the company or any of its subsidiaries that is pending or imminent at the time and promptly gives each purchaser notice of that determination (it being understood, however, that, in any such event, the company shall use best efforts to minimize the length of the postponement). if the company shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, a purchaser shall have the right to withdraw its request by giving written notice to the company within 30 days after the company shall have given the notice of postponement and, in the event of the withdrawal, the request that was withdrawn shall not be deemed to have been made. 6.6 expenses of registration. all expenses (excluding underwriting or brokerage commissions attributable to the registrable shares to be sold) incurred in connection with all registrations under this agreement and the "blue sky" qualifica- tions referred to in section 6.4(c), including, without limita- tion, all registration and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees and fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, shall be borne by the company. notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in any registration under this section 6, the company shall be obligated to bear the fees or expenses of only one counsel for the purchasers (which counsel shall be selected by the holders of a majority of the registrable shares making the demand request, in the case of a demand request, or otherwise by holders of a majority of the registrable shares included in the registration), and shall not be required to bear any such fees or expenses in respect of more than two (three, if shares are included in a registration statement in accordance with any agreement listed on schedule 6.1) long-form demand registrations. 6.7 underwriting requirements. in connection with any offering pursuant to a piggyback request, the company shall not be required to register any registrable shares held by any purchaser, unless the purchaser accepts the terms of the under- writing and then only in such quantity as will not, in the written opinion of the underwriters, exceed the maximum number of registrable shares that can be marketed without materially and adversely affecting the offering, if any, by the company. if, as a consequence of the provisions of the preceding sentence, the number of a particular purchaser's registrable shares is reduced, the percentage of reduction shall not be more than the percentage of reduction applicable to any other purchaser or any other shareholder entitled to participate under any registration rights agreement listed on schedule 3.2.11 and not listed on schedule 6.1. 6.8 other registration rights. without the prior written consent of the purchasers of a majority of the series a preferred shares, the company shall not enter into any other agreement entitling any person or entity to registration rights. 6.9 indemnification. to the extent permitted by law, the company shall indemnify and hold harmless each underwriter, if any, and each purchaser that participates in any registration under this agreement, and each person, if any, who is a director, officer, agent, partner or shareholder of, or who controls (within the meaning of rule 12b-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange

shall include contribution in the manner and to the extent customarily provided and in accordance with the underwriter's customary form. no purchaser in any such registration that relates to an underwritten offering shall be required to make any representation or warranty to the underwriter(s) or the company, except as they relate solely to that purchaser and its method of distribution, and

majority of the registrable shares then outstanding, each purchaser shall, and shall cause that purchaser's transferees in private placements to, agree with the underwriters in any underwritten public

of capital stock after the date of this agreement pursuant to a registration statement under the 1933 act, or up to 90 days, in the case of subsequent underwritten public offerings by the company of

cathy markey ruff stockholders agreement /s/ christopher l. rafferty christopher l. rafferty ex-99 8 exhibit f governance agreement this governance agreement (this "agreement"), dated as of november 8, 1995, by and among american communications services, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), and certain holders of the outstanding shares of 9% series a-1 convertible preferred stock, $100 par value (the "series a-1 preferred stock"), 9% series b-1 convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value, 9% series b-2 convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value and 9% series b-3 convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value (collectively, the "series b preferred stock" and together with the series a-1 preferred stock, the "preferred stock") of the company set forth in schedule i hereto (collectively the "voting shareholders"). r e c i t a l s whereas, the company's certificate of designations of the board of directors relating to the series a-1 preferred stock and the series b preferred stock filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware on june 26, 1995 (the "current certificate of designations") contains provisions relating to the size, composition, election and powers of the board of directors of the company (the "board") and certain separate class voting rights for the holders of the series a-1 preferred stock and series b preferred stock (the "preferred veto rights"); whereas, the nasdaq smallcap market ("nasdaq") has required that the foregoing provisions in the current certificate be amended and restated in the manner set forth in exhibit a (the "certificate of designations amendments") as a condition to the company's continued listing on nasdaq; and whereas, the voting shareholders deem it to be in their best interests and the best interests of the company for the company's listing on nasdaq to be maintained; and whereas, the voting shareholders deem it to be in their best interests and the best interests of the company to use all reasonable efforts to cause the composition and election of the board and the preferred veto rights to be consistent with the certificate of designations amendments until such time as such amendments are approved by the stockholders of the company, notwithstanding any contrary provisions in the current certificate of designations; and whereas, pursuant to the certificate of designations of the board of directors relating to the 9% series a convertible preferred stock (the "series a certificate") which was filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware on october 19, 1994 it is deemed that a triggering event (as such term was defined in the series a certificate) would have occurred on or prior to june 26, 1995, the date a certificate of elimination relating to the series a certificate was filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware; and whereas, pursuant to the series a certificate the occurrence of a triggering event would have caused an increase in the size of the board of directors from seven directors to 11 directors and result in the composition of the board changing from four directors elected by the holders of the common stock and three directors elected by the holders of the preferred stock to four directors elected by the holders of the common stock and seven directors elected by the holders of the preferred stock; and whereas, under the series a certificate the board would have remained at 11 directors, with four elected by the holders of the common stock and seven elected by the holders of the preferred stock, for one year after all triggering events had been cured; and whereas, the aforementioned triggering event would have been deemed to have been cured on june 26, 1995; and whereas, the provisions regarding the size and composition of the board including upon the occurrence of a triggering event, contained in the certificate of designations amendments are substantially similar to those set forth in the series a certificate. now therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. triggering event. until such time as the certificate of designations amendments are duly adopted by the stockholders of the company and filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware ("approval of the certificate of designations amendments"), notwithstanding any contrary provisions contained in the current certificate of designations, a triggering event shall be the occurrence of any of the events or transactions set forth in section 2(e) of the certificate of designations amendments, rather than the occurrence of any of the events or transactions set forth in section 2(e) of the current certificate of designations. 2. board of directors. until approval of the certificate of designations amendments, notwithstanding any contrary provisions in the current certificate of designations, the parties agree that matters relating to the size, composition, election and powers of the board and the committees of the board shall be governed by the terms and provisions set forth in section 6 of the certificate of designations amendments, rather than section 6 of the current certificate of designations; provided that, until june 26, 1996 (unless another triggering event occurs prior thereto, in which case the applicable provisions of the certificate of designations amendments shall apply with respect thereto), the board shall consist of 11 directors, four of whom will be elected by the holders of the common stock (the "common directors") and seven of whom will be elected by the holders of the preferred stock (the "preferred directors"); and provided further, that on june 26, 1996 (unless another triggering event shall have occurred prior thereto) the board shall revert to seven directors, four of whom will be common directors and three of whom will be preferred directors. 3. preferred stockholder veto rights. until approval of the certificate of designations amendments, notwithstanding any contrary provisions in the current certificate of designations, the parties agree that the terms and provisions set forth in section 7 of the certificate of designations amendments relating to the rights of the holders of the preferred stock to vote as a separate class on certain matters will govern the company's obligation in this regard, rather than the provisions of section 7 of the current certificate of designations. 4. further assurances. the voting shareholders will use all reasonable efforts and take all reasonable actions to enable the company to be governed by the terms and provisions of this agreement. 5. general provisions. 5.1 contents of agreement, parties in

(i) except as otherwise provided in this section 3, each share of series a-1 preferred stock shall be convertible (at the office or agency referred to in section 3(b)(i)) into a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/10,000 of a share) of common stock equal to the number obtained by dividing $90.00 by $2.25 ($2.25 being the "series a-1 conversion price") or, if the series a-1 conversion price shall have been adjusted in accordance with this section 3, by dividing $90.00 by the series a-1 conversion price as last adjusted and in effect at the date any share or shares of series a-1 preferred stock are surrendered for conversion. for purposes hereof the term "series a-1 conversion price" shall refer to the conversion price for the series a-1 preferred stock, as last adjusted pursuant to this section 3. (ii) except as otherwise provided in this section 3, each share of series b preferred stock shall be convertible (at the office or agency referred to in section 3(b)(i)) into a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/10,000 of a share) of common stock equal to the number obtained by dividing $100.00 by $2.80 ($2.80 being the "series b conversion price") or, if the series b conversion price shall have been adjusted in accordance with this section 3, by dividing $100.00 by the series b conversion price as last adjusted and in effect at the date any share or shares of series b preferred stock are surrendered for conversion. for purposes hereof the term "series b conversion price" shall refer to the conversion price for the series b preferred stock, as last adjusted pursuant to this section 3. (b) procedures. (i) to exercise the right to convert shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock, the holder of the shares of the preferred stock to be converted shall present and surrender the certificate(s) representing the shares during usual business hours at any office or agency of the company maintained for the transfer of the preferred stock and shall deliver a written notice of the election of the holder to convert the shares represented by that certificate or any portion of those shares specified in that notice. that notice also shall state the name or names (with address(es)) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock issuable on conversion shall be issued. if so required by the company, any certificate for shares of preferred stock surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the company, duly executed by the holder of the shares surrendered for conversion or the holder's duly authorized representative. each conversion of shares of preferred stock shall be deemed to have been effected on the date (the "conversion date") on which the certificate or certificates representing the shares shall have been surrendered and that written notice and any required instruments of transfer shall have been so received, and the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of common stock shall be issuable on conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of common stock represented by the certificate or certificates immediately prior to the close of business on the conversion date. (ii) as promptly as practicable after the presentation and surrender for conversion of any certificate for shares of preferred stock, the company shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of those shares a certificate or certificates for the aggregate number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion. in case any certificate for shares of preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion of only a portion of the shares represented by that certificate, the company shall deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of those shares a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of series a-1 preferred stock or series b preferred stock, as the case may be, represented by the surrendered certificate that are not being converted. the issuance of certificates for shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of preferred stock shall be made without charge to the converting holder for any tax in respect of the issue of the shares of common stock. the company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax that may be payable based on the issue and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the holder of the shares of preferred stock being converted, and the company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such certificate, unless and until the person requesting the issue shall have paid the company the amount of that tax or established to the reasonable satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid or that no tax is due. (iii) upon any conversion of shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock in accordance with this section 3 at any time on or before december 31, 1997, the company shall deliver to the holder, within three (3) business days after the conversion date, in lieu of all accrued and unpaid dividends through the conversion date on all shares to be converted, a promissory note in the form of exhibit 3(b)(iii) hereto, executed by the company and payable to the order of that holder in the principal amount of that holder's accumulated and accrued dividends only those dividends shall be payable on shares of common stock issuable upon conversion as may be declared and may be payable to those entitled to be holders of record of shares of common stock after that conversion date in accordance with section 3(b)(i). (c) adjustment of conversion price upon issuance of common stock. except as provided in section 3(c)(ix), if at any time the company shall issue, grant or sell, or is, in accordance with section 3(c)(i) through (x), deemed to have issued, granted or sold, any shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the series a-1 conversion price or series b conversion price, as the case may be, in effect immediately prior to the issuance, grant or sale (or, in the case of any pro rata distribution to holders of the common stock of rights to subscribe for the common stock or options, rights, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for the common stock (a "pro rata rights offering"), the lesser of such conversion price or the market price of the common stock (as defined in section 3(d)) at that time), then, upon that issuance, grant or sale, such conversion price shall be reduced to the amount specified in the following clause (ww) (or, in the case of pro rata rights offerings, the lesser of the following clauses (ww) and (xx)): (ww) in the case of the issuance, grant or sale, or deemed issuance, grant or sale, by the company of shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than such conversion price, the price determined by dividing (1) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to that issuance, grant or sale (including as outstanding all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock for which the conversion price is being adjusted) multiplied by such conversion price then in effect, and (b) the consideration, if any, received by the company upon that issuance, grant or sale, by (2) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after that issuance, grant or sale (including as outstanding all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock for which the conversion price is being adjusted); and (xx) in the case of the issuance, grant or sale, or deemed issuance, grant or sale, by the company of shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the market price of the common stock, the price determined by multiplying such conversion price in effect immediately prior to that issuance, grant or sale by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to that issuance, grant or sale (including as outstanding all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock for which the conversion price is being adjusted) multiplied by the market price of the common stock immediately prior to that issuance, grant or sale plus (b) the consideration, if any, received by the company upon that issuance, grant or sale, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after that issuance, grant or sale (including as outstanding all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock for which the conversion price is being adjusted) multiplied by the market price of the common stock immediately prior to that issuance, grant or sale. for purposes of this section 3(c), the following also shall be applicable: (i) issuance of rights or options. in case at any time the company shall in any manner grant (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, common stock or any stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock (such rights, warrants or options being called "options" and such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities being called "convertible securities"), whether or not such options or the right to convert or exchange such convertible securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such options or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities (determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the granting of such options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of such options, plus, in the case of convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities) shall be less than the series a-1 conversion price or series b conversion price, as the case may be, immediately prior to the granting of such options, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum number of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options shall be deemed to have been issued for such price per share as of the date of the granting of such options and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding, except as otherwise provided in section 3(c)(iii), no additional adjustment of such conversion price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such common stock upon exercise of such options or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 3(c), the issuance of the warrants (as defined in the series a investment agreement) and the warrants (as defined in the series b purchase agreement) and any subsequent exercise of the warrants (as defined in the series a investment agreement) or the warrants (as defined in the series b purchase agreement) shall not affect either the series a-1 conversion price or the series b conversion price. if, upon the expiration of such options or rights to convert or exchange such convertible securities, such options remain unexercised or such convertible securities remain unconverted or unexchanged, as the case may be, such conversion price shall again be adjusted as if such unexercised options or unconverted or unexchanged convertible securities had not been granted. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. in case the company shall in any manner issue (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise), grant or sell any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert such convertible securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (a) the total amount received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuance, grant or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities) shall be less than the series a-1 conversion price or the series b conversion price, as the case may be, immediately prior to the issuance, grant or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued for such price per share as of the date of the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding; provided, however, that (y) except as otherwise provided in section 3(c)(iii), no additional adjustment of such conversion price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and (z) if any such issuance, grant or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any option to purchase any of the convertible securities for which adjustments of such conversion price have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 3(c), no further adjustment of such conversion price shall be made by reason of the issuance, grant or sale. if, upon the expiration of the right to convert or exchange such convertible securities, such convertible securities remain unconverted or unexchanged, as the case may be, such conversion price shall again be adjusted as if such unconverted or unexchanged convertible securities had not been issued, granted or sold. (iii) change in option price or conversion rate. if the purchase price provided for in any option referred to in section 3(c)(i), the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible securities referred to in section 3(c)(i) or (ii) or the rate at which any convertible securities referred to in section 3(c)(i) or (ii) are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock shall change at any time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), the series a-1 conversion price or the series b conversion price in effect at the time of that event shall be readjusted to the series a-1 conversion price or the series b conversion price, as the case may be, that would have been in effect at that time had such options or convertible securities still outstanding provided for that changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. (iv) stock dividends. in case the company shall declare a dividend or make any other distribution upon any stock of the company payable in common stock, options or convertible securities, any common stock, options or convertible securities, as the case may be, issuable in payment of that dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been issued, granted or sold without consideration and the series a-1 conversion price and the series b conversion price shall be adjusted accordingly under the provisions of this section 3(c). (v) consideration for stock. in case any shares of common stock, options or convertible securities shall be issued, granted or sold for cash, the consideration received by the company shall be deemed to be the amount received by the company, without deduction of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions paid or allowed in connection with the issuance, grant or sale. in case any shares of common stock, options or convertible securities shall be issued, granted or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company shall be deemed to be the fair market value of that consideration as determined in good faith by disinterested members of the board of directors of the company (which shall consider, if the transaction involves, directly or indirectly, 2,000,000 or more shares of common stock, the opinion of a leading firm of investment bankers selected by a majority of the preferred directors (as defined in section 6(d)) and reasonably acceptable to the company and whose reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid by the company), without deduction of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions paid or allowed in connection with the issuance, grant or sale. in case any options shall be issued in connection with the issuance, grant or sale of other securities of the company, together comprising one integral transaction in which the parties do not specifically allocate consideration to such options, such options shall be deemed to have been issued without consideration and the conversion price shall be adjusted accordingly under the provisions of this section 3(c) . (vi) record date. in case the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, options or convertible securities, or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, options or convertible securities, then, upon such issuance, grant or sale, that record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issuance, grant or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued, granted or sold upon the declaration of the dividend or the making of the other distribution or the date of the granting of the right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (vii) treasury shares. the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the company or any of its subsidiaries, and the disposition (other than to the company or any of its subsidiaries) of any such shares shall be considered an issuance, grant or sale of common stock for purposes of this section 3(c). (viii) subdivision or combination of stock. in case the company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares (by way of dividend, split or otherwise), the series a-1 conversion price and the series b conversion price in effect immediately prior to the subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and in case the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares (by way of reverse split or otherwise) the series a-1 conversion price and the series b conversion price in effect immediately prior to the combination shall be proportionately increased. (ix) certain issues of common stock excepted. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 3(c), the company shall not be required to make any adjustment of the series a-1 conversion price or series b conversion price in case of (a) the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of shares of preferred stock, (b) the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to options and convertible securities outstanding on june 26, 1995 or issuable pursuant to agreements which are effective on or before such date, and set forth on exhibit a to schedule 3.2.7 to the series b purchase agreement, or (c) the issuance of up to an additional 750,000 shares of common stock (or the issuance of options to purchase such shares) to employees or consultants of the company and its subsidiaries as management or employee incentives (as approved by the board of directors to the extent so required pursuant to sections 6(d) and 7). (x) reorganization or reclassification. if any capital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the company shall be effected in such a way (including, without limitation, by way of consolidation or merger or a sale of all or substantially all its assets) that holders of common stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for common stock, then, as a condition of the reorganization or reclassification, lawful and adequate provisions shall be made whereby each holder of shares of preferred stock shall thereafter have the right to receive, in lieu of the shares of common stock of the company theretofore receivable upon the conversion of such shares, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock theretofore so receivable had the reorganization or reclassification not taken place, and in any such case appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the holder to the end that the provision of this section 3 (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the series a-1 conversion price and series b conversion price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of those conversion rights. in the event of a merger or consolidation of the company as a result of which a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation are issuable to holders of common stock of the company outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, the series a-1 conversion price and series b conversion price in effect immediately prior to the merger or consolidation shall be adjusted in the same manner as though there were a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company in accordance with section 3(c)(viii). (xi) certain distributions. in the event that the company shall make any distribution of its assets upon or with respect to the common stock that does not constitute a dividend payable out of earnings or any surplus legally available for dividends under the delaware general corporation law and that distribution does not constitute a liquidation under section 5, the holder of each outstanding share of preferred stock shall, after the record date for that distribution or, in the absence of a record date, after the date of that distribution, receive, the amount of such assets (or, at the option of the company, a sum equal to the value of such assets at the time of distribution as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company (which shall consider the opinion of a leading firm of investment bankers selected by a majority of the preferred directors and reasonably acceptable to the company and whose reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid by the company)) that would have been distributed to such holder if the holder had converted that share of preferred stock into common stock immediately prior to the record date for that distribution or, in the absence of a record date, immediately prior to the date of that distribution. (d) market price of the common stock. for all purposes of this section 3 and section 4, the "market price of the common stock" at any date shall be determined as follows: (i) if the common stock is publicly traded at the time of determination, the average of the closing prices for the common stock on all domestic securities exchanges on which such security may at the time be listed (it being understood that, for these purposes, the nasdaq national market system is deemed an "exchange") or, if there have been no sales on any such exchange on such day, the average of this highest bid and lowest asked prices on all such exchanges at the end of such day, or, if on any day such security is not so listed, the average of the representative bid and asked prices quoted on the nasdaq system as of 4:00 p.m., new york time, on such day, or if on such day such security is not quoted in the nasdaq system, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on such day in the domestic over-the-counter market as reported by the national quotation bureau, incorporated, or any similar successor organization, in each such case averaged over a period of twenty-one (21) days consisting of the day as of which "market price of the common stock" is being determined and the twenty (20) consecutive business days prior to such day (a "business day" being a day that is not a legal holiday or other day on which banking institutions or any national securities exchanges are authorized by law or executive order to close); or (ii) if the common stock is not publicly traded at the time of determination then, solely for purposes of this section 3, the fair value of the common stock as determined by the company's board of directors, taking into account their fiduciary duties (including to the holders of the preferred stock as if converted). (e) immaterial adjustments. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 3, (i) no adjustment in the number of shares of common stock into which any share of preferred stock is convertible shall be required, unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease in the number of shares of at least 1% and (ii) no adjustment in either the series a-1 conversion price or series b conversion price shall be required, unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least $.001 per share; provided, however, that any adjustments that, by reason of this section 3(e), are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. on any conversion date, all adjustments so carried forward shall be made at the time of such conversion. all calculations under this section 3 shall be made to the nearest $.001 or the nearest 1/10,000 of a share, as the case may be. (f) notice of adjustment. whenever any adjustment is required in the shares into which any share of preferred stock is convertible, the company shall promptly (i) file with each office or agency maintained by the company for the transfer of preferred stock a statement describing in reasonable detail the adjustment and the method of calculation used (which, at the time of such filing, shall be certified as correct by the company's independent accountants) and (ii) cause a notice of the adjustment, setting forth the adjusted series a-1 conversion price or series b conversion price, as the case may be, to be mailed to the holders of record of shares of preferred stock at their respective addresses on the books of the company. (g) no rights after conversion. all shares of preferred stock that shall have been surrendered for conversion in accordance with this section 3 or section 4 shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to those shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall cease, except for the right of the holders, subject to the provisions of this section 3, to receive shares of common stock upon the conversion and any accumulated and accrued but unpaid dividends. (h) certain notices. in the event that: (i) the company shall take action to make any distribution to the holders of its common stock; (ii) the company shall take action to effect a pro rata rights offering; (iii) the company shall take action to accomplish any capital reorganization, or reclassification of the capital stock of the company (other than a subdivision, split or combination of its common stock), or a consolidation or merger to which the company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the company is required, or the sale or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the company; or (iv) the company shall take action or attempt to take action to cause a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the company; then the company shall (a) in case of any such distribution or pro rata rights offering, at least 30 days prior to the date or expected date on which the books of the company shall close or a record shall be taken for the determination of holders entitled to the distribution or rights, and (b) in the case of any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, at least 30 days prior to the date or expected date when that event shall take place (for the avoidance of doubt, it being understood that, in each such case, the shares of preferred stock shall continue to be convertible at any time during the applicable 30-day (or longer) period), cause written notice thereof to be mailed to each holder of shares of preferred stock at the holder's address on the books of the company. any notice under clause (a) also shall specify the date or expected date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to the distribution or rights, and any notice under clause (b) also shall specify the date or expected date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. (i) common stock. for purposes of this section 3, the term "common stock" shall mean (i) the class of stock designated as the common stock of the company on the date of this certificate of designations or (ii) any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassifications of such common stock consisting solely of changes in par value, or from no par value to par value, or from par value to no par value. if at any time as a result of an adjustment pursuant to section 3(c) a holder of shares of preferred stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of the company other than shares of common stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of shares of preferred stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the common stock in section 3(c), and the other provisions of this section 3 with respect to the common stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. (j) fractions. no fractional share of common stock, or scrip representing a fractional share, shall be issued upon the conversion of any preferred stock. if more than one share of preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares so surrendered. if any fractional interest in a share of common stock would be deliverable upon the conversion of any shares of preferred stock, the company shall pay, in lieu of the fractional share, in cash that fraction of the market price of the common stock on the business day immediately preceding the conversion. (k) reserved shares. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of preferred stock, a number of its authorized shares of common stock sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into common stock at any time; provided, however, that nothing in this section 3(k) shall preclude the company from satisfying its obligations in respect of the conversion of shares by delivery of shares of common stock then held in the treasury of the company. the company shall, from time to time, use its best efforts to cause the authorized number of shares of common stock to be increased, if the aggregate number of authorized shares of common stock remaining unissued and the issued shares of common stock in its treasury (other than any shares of common stock reserved for issuance in any other connection) shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into common stock. 4. automatic conversion (a) general (i) in the event the company consummate a qualifying offering, all outstanding shares of preferred stock shall be converted into shares of common stock simultaneously with the first closing of the qualifying offering, automatically and without any further action by any person. the number of shares of common stock into which each share of series a-1 preferred stock shall be converted shall be the number obtained by dividing $90.00 by the series a-1 conversion price then in effect and the number of shares of common stock into which each share of series b preferred stock shall be converted shall be the number obtained by dividing $100.00 by the series b conversion price then in effect. (ii) as used in this certificate of designations, the term "qualifying offering" means a fully-distributed, firm commitment underwritten public offering of shares of common stock of the company registered under the securities act of 1933, (a) in which (y) the gross proceeds to the company (i.e., gross proceeds without any deduction for expenses or for underwriting commissions or concessions) are at least $15,000,000 and (z) the initial price to the public per share of common stock is at least $5.00, as appropriately adjusted to reflect all subdivisions, splits, share dividends or combinations of the common stock or any pro rata rights offering (any such subdivision, split, share dividend, combination or pro rata rights offering, a recapitalization event") occurring after the date of this certificate of designations and (b) the result of which is the inclusion of the common stock in the nasdaq national market system or listing of the common stock on the new york stock exchange. (iii) immediately after the conversion under this section 4, the company shall give a written notice of the conversion (the "automatic conversion notice") to all the former holders of record of shares of preferred stock at their respective addresses on the books of the company. the automatic conversion notice shall set forth the instructions for effecting the exchange of certificates, which shall be as nearly the same as practicable as under section 3, the terms of which (including, without limitation, sections 3(g) and 3(j)) are, except as otherwise expressly provided in this section 4, incorporated in this section 4, mutatis mutandis. (iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 4(a) and except as provided in section 3(c)(xi), no dividend or other distribution of any nature whatsoever payable in respect of the common stock after the conversion under this section 4 shall be paid (but shall accrue) to a holder of any unsurrendered certificate evidencing shares of preferred stock, unless the certificate or certificates evidencing the holder's shares of preferred stock so converted are delivered to the company in accordance with the automatic conversion notice or the holder notifies the company that the certificate or certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the company to indemnify the company against any resulting loss it incurs. thereupon, (a) there shall be issued and delivered to the holder, in the holder's name shown on the certificate or certificates, a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of common stock into which the holder's shares of preferred stock were converted (together with any cash payment in lieu of a fractional share) and (b) the holder shall be entitled to payment of the amount referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this certificate of designations, upon any conversion of shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock pursuant to this section 4, the company shall pay, on the conversion date, all accumulated and accrued but unpaid dividends in cash; provided, however, that if, in connection with the qualifying offering, the underwriter advises the company in writing that such payment would materially and adversely affect the qualifying offering, in lieu of the immediate payment of such accumulated and accrued but unpaid dividends to the holder, the company shall, within 30 days after delivering the automatic conversion notice, (i) pay the holder its pro rata share, based upon the aggregate amount of accumulated and accrued but unpaid dividends owed by the company to all holders of preferred stock and the amount of such dividends owed to such holder, the greatest of (a) the amount the underwriter advises would not so affect the qualifying offering, (b) 5% of the net proceeds to the company of the qualifying offering (i.e., gross proceeds less deductions for all expenses and underwriting commissions and concessions), but not more than all accumulated and accrued but unpaid dividends, or (c) 10% of the then accumulated and accrued but unpaid dividends, and (ii) issue and deliver to each holder a promissory note in the form of exhibit 4(b) hereto, executed by the company and payable to the order of that holder in the principal amount of the balance of that holder's accumulated and accrued dividends; provided that, at the option of such holder and in lieu of the receipt of such a promissory note in the form of exhibit 4(b) hereto, such holder may elect, by written notice delivered to the company no later than 20 days after the company's delivery of the automatic conversion notice, to receive the number of shares of common stock equal to the principal amount of such note divided by the initial price to the public per share of the common stock sold in the qualifying offering. a certificate representing such shares of common stock shall be delivered by the company to such holder as soon as practicable after the company's receipt of such holder's election to receive such shares of common stock, but in no event later than 20 days after such receipt. (c) any note issued pursuant to sections 2(c), 3(b)(iii) or 4(b) may be converted at any time prior to payment in full thereof, at the option of the holder of such note, by written notice given to the company by such holder, into the number of shares of common stock equal to (i) the sum of the then outstanding principal amount of such note and any accrued interest thereon, divided by (ii) the market price of the common stock as of the date notice of such election is given by such holder; provided, however, that if such notice is given within 20 business days after consummation of the qualifying offering, the number of shares of common stock to be issued hereunder shall be determined by dividing the amount determined under clause (i) by the initial price to the public per share of the common stock sold in the qualifying offering. a certificate representing such shares of common stock shall be delivered by the company to such holder as soon as practicable after the company's receipt of such holder's election to receive such shares of common stock and the company's receipt and cancellation of such note, but in no event later than 20 days after receipt of such election and note. 5. liquidation. in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock shall be entitled to receive for each such share payment in cash equal to the sum of (a) $90.00 in the case of series a-1 preferred stock (the "series a-1 liquidation value") and $100.00 in the case of the series b preferred stock (the "series b liquidation value"), plus in each case an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends (but excluding accumulated dividends) to the date of payment, or final payment, if there is more than one payment (the "series a-1 liquidation value", the "series b liquidation value", and the amount of such accrued and unpaid dividends shall collectively constitute the "liquidation value"), plus (b) an amount (the "accumulated dividend amount") equal to all accumulated but unpaid dividends to the dividend payment date immediately preceding the date of payment or final payment, as the case may be, and no more. as to distribution upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the series a-1 preferred stock and series b preferred stock shall rank pari passu with each other and shall rank senior to the common stock of the company. an amount equal to the sum of the liquidation value plus the accumulated dividend amount shall be paid to the holders of preferred stock before any payment or distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of common stock of the company. the voluntary sale, conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the company (unless, in connection therewith, the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company is specifically approved), or the merger or consolidation of the company into or with any other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or any purchase or redemption of shares of stock of the company of any class or series, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company for purposes of this section 5. nothing in this section 5 shall be deemed to limit in any way the right of the holders of shares of preferred stock to convert any or all of those shares at any time before or simultaneously with the payment to all those holders in respect of those shares of an amount equal to the liquidation value plus the accumulated dividend amount in respect of all those shares. after the distributions described above have been paid, the remaining assets of the company available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of the preferred stock, any other series or class of preferred stock entitled to a share of the remaining assets of the company and common stock pro rata based on the number of shares of common stock held by each (assuming full conversion of all such preferred stock or such other series or class of preferred stock). 6. voting; governance.

(b) board of directors. (i) subject to section 6(b)(ii), the board of directors of the company shall have seven members, of which the holders of shares of common stock shall have the right to elect four and the holders of shares of preferred stock shall have the right to elect three (the directors so elected by the holders of the preferred stock, the "elected preferred directors"). (ii) upon the occurrence of a triggering event, (a) the board of directors shall be increased to 11 members, (b) the newly created directorships resulting from that increase shall be filled by individuals elected by the holders of preferred stock (those so elected, the "expansion preferred directors") and (c) the board of directors shall continue to have 11 members, of which holders of shares of common stock shall have the right to elect four, and of which holders of shares of preferred stock shall have the right to elect three elected preferred directors and, until the first anniversary of the cure of the triggering event the occurrence of which gave rise to the provisions of this subparagraph (ii), four expansion preferred directors. one year after all triggering events shall have been cured, the board of directors shall be reduced to seven directors and the expansion preferred directors shall cease to be directors. notwithstanding the foregoing the occurrence of the triggering events in section 2(e)(iv) or 2(e)(vi) shall not cause the increase in the size of the board of directors or the other foregoing provisions of this section 6(b)(ii) to be implemented. (c) procedures (i) each director of the company shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. any vacancy caused by the death or resignation of a preferred director may be filled only by the holders of preferred stock entitled to vote for such preferred director. a special meeting of the holders of the preferred stock entitled to vote with respect to filling the vacancy shall be called and held as promptly as practicable after any such death or resignation at the direction of a majority of the board of directors, and in any event shall be called within ten days, to be held within 15 days, after receipt of a written request by the holders of record of at least 50% of the then outstanding shares of preferred stock so entitled to vote. in connection with any special meeting to be held for the purpose of electing a preferred director to fill a vacancy, only such holders of the preferred stock entitled to vote for such preferred director shall be notified and be permitted to participate at such meeting. if any special meeting of the holders of preferred stock required to be called for the election of directors pursuant to this section 6(c) shall not have been called within ten days after the request therefor has been made upon the secretary of the company, the holders of record of at least 50% of the then outstanding shares of the preferred stock so entitled to vote may designate in writing one of their number to call the meeting, and the meeting may be called by the person so designated upon notice in accordance with the notice required for annual meetings of stockholders. any holder of shares of preferred stock so designated shall have access to the stock record books of the company for the purpose of so calling a special meeting. the company shall pay the reasonable expenses of calling and holding any such meeting. (ii) any special meeting of the holders of shares of preferred stock to vote for the election of directors pursuant to this section 6(c) shall be held in the city in which the next preceding annual meeting of stockholders of the company was held. at a special or annual meeting for the election of directors by the holders of shares of preferred stock, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of 50% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock entitled to vote thereon shall constitute a quorum. in connection with any special meeting to be held for the purpose of electing a preferred director to fill a vacancy, only such holders of the preferred stock entitled to vote for such preferred director shall be notified and be permitted to participate at such meeting. a majority of the holders of the shares of preferred stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the meeting for the purpose of such election, from time to time without notice, other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

schedule 3.2.7 to the series b purchase agreement) (a "proposed issuance"), each holder of shares of preferred stock or common stock issued upon conversion thereof shall have the right (which the holder may exercise in whole or in part) to purchase, upon the same terms, a proportionate quantity of those securities in the proportion that the aggregate number of shares of common stock (assuming exercise of all warrants (as defined in the series a investment agreement and that certain note purchase agreement (the "note purchase agreement") dated as of june 28, 1994 relating to the company's 15% convertible notes due december 31, 1994) and warrants (as defined in the series b purchase agreement) and conversion of all preferred stock) then beneficially owned (as that term is used in the rules and regulations under the securities exchange act of 1934) and that were acquired under either the series a investment agreement, the series b purchase agreement or the exchange agreement by that party bears to the total number of shares of common stock (assuming exercise of all warrants (as defined in the series b purchase agreement, series a investment agreement and note purchase agreement)) and conversion of all preferred stock) of the company then beneficially owned and that were acquired under such investment agreement, exchange agreement and purchase agreement by all holders of shares of preferred stock or common stock issued upon conversion thereof. the company shall give notice to each holder setting forth the identity of the proposed purchaser and the time, which shall not be fewer than 45 days and not more than 60 days, within which, and the terms upon which, each holder may elect, by written notice given to the company in accordance with the company's notice to each holder, to purchase the securities, which terms shall be the same as the terms upon which the proposed purchaser may purchase the securities. if there is any change in any terms of the proposed issuance, the holders shall have no further rights with respect to that proposed issuance, and the provisions of this section 8 shall again apply to the proposed issuance, as so changed, as if the proposed issuance, as so changed, were being proposed initially as the proposed issuance. if any holder (a "shortfall purchaser") wishes to purchase a quantity of securities greater than the holder's proportionate quantity and any other holder wishes to purchase fewer than that holder's proportionate quantity of securities (a "shortfall"), the shortfall purchaser may (in accordance with an election that may be made pursuant to the company's notice to each holder) elect to purchase any or all of the aggregate amount of all the shortfalls in the proportion that the amount of shortfalls specified by the shortfall purchaser in the election to purchase securities bears to the aggregate amount of all the shortfalls specified by all shortfall purchasers in all the election to purchase securities. any securities not purchased by the holders of shares of preferred stock under this section 8 may thereafter be sold to the proposed purchaser at any time within 90 days after the expiration of that 45- or 60-day period on the same terms as those upon which holders of shares of preferred stock were entitled to purchase the securities. 9. retirement of shares. shares of preferred stock that are converted into shares of common stock as provided in this certificate of designations or otherwise acquired by the company in any manner shall be permanently retired and shall

an increase or decrease in the number of shares constituting series a-1 preferred stock or series b preferred stock, but no such decrease shall reduce at any time the number of shares of preferred stock at the time outstanding. 11. transfer agent, conversion agent and registrar. the company shall, as long as any shares of preferred stock are outstanding, maintain an office or agency where the shares may be presented for registration of transfer and exchange and for conversion. 12. governmental approvals; listing. if any shares of common stock that would be issuable upon conversion of shares of preferred stock require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before the shares may be issued upon conversion, the company shall use its best efforts as expeditiously as possible to cause the shares to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. the company shall endeavor to list the shares of (or depository shares representing interests in) common stock required to be delivered upon conversion of shares of preferred stock prior to such delivery upon the principal national securities exchange, if any, upon which the outstanding common stock is listed at the time of delivery. 13. certain conflicts. to the extent any provision of this certificate of designations conflicts, or is otherwise inconsistent, with a provision of the company's by-laws, the provision of this certificate of designations shall be given effect, and the by-laws shall be deemed amended accordingly. 14. action by consent without a meeting. any action required or permitted to be taken by holders of shares of preferred stock at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by holders of shares of preferred stock having not fewer than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of preferred stock entitled to vote were present and voted and such consent bearing the date of the signature of each holder of preferred stock signing the consent is delivered to the registered office of the company in the state of delaware, its principal place of business or the secretary of the company. such consent if less than unanimous consent, shall be delivered to those holders of shares of preferred stock who have not consented in writing. 15. notice. any notice, request, claim, demand, document or other communication hereunder to any party shall be effective when delivered (or upon refusal of receipt) and shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by telex or telecopy (with such telex or telecopy confirmed promptly in writing sent by first class

inc. by: ______________________________ name: title: ex-99 9 exhibit g supplemental governance agreement this supplemental governance agreement (this "agreement"), dated as of february 26, 1996, by and among american communications services, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), and certain holders of the outstanding shares of 9% series a-1 convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value (the "series a-1 preferred stock"), 9% series b-1 convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value, 9% series b-2 convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value, 9% series b-3 convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value and 9% series b-4 convertible preferred stock, $1.00 par value (collectively, the "series b preferred stock" and together with the series a-1 preferred stock, the "preferred stock") of the company set forth in schedule i hereto (collectively the "voting shareholders"). all terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the governance agreement dated as of november 9, 1995 between the company and the voting shareholders. r e c i t a l s whereas, on november 8, 1995, in response to voting rights issues raised by the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system ("nasdaq") and in fulfillment of a condition to the company's continued listing on nasdaq, the company and the voting shareholders entered into a governance agreement (the "governance agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, the voting shareholders agree to cause the composition and election of the board of directors and the preferred veto rights to be consistent with the certificate of designations amendments until such time as such amendments were approved by the stockholders of the company, notwithstanding any contrary provisions in the current certificate of designations; and whereas, pursuant to the governance agreement, it was deemed that a triggering event (as such term was defined in the series a certificate) would have occurred on or prior to june 26, 1995, the date a certificate of elimination relating to the series a certificate was filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware; and whereas, pursuant to the series a certificate the occurrence of a triggering event would have caused an increase in the size of the board of directors from seven directors to 11 directors and resulted in the composition of the board changing from four directors elected by the holders of the common stock and three directors elected by the holders of the preferred stock to four directors elected by the holders of the common stock and seven directors elected by the holders of the preferred stock; and whereas, under the series a certificate the board would have remained at 11 directors, with four elected by the holders of the common stock and seven elected by the holders of the preferred stock, for one year after all triggering events had been cured; and whereas, the aforementioned triggering event would have been deemed to have been cured on june 26, 1995; and whereas, in connection with the company's application to have its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "common stock") be included in the nasdaq national market system ("nasdaq/nms"), nasdaq/nms has required that the board revert to its original structure of seven members; and whereas, pursuant to the governance agreement, the board was to consist of 11 directors until june 26, 1996; and whereas, the governance agreement was terminated pursuant to its terms upon the approval by the company's stockholders on january 26, 1996 of certain amendments to the company's certificate of incorporation; and whereas, the voting shareholders deem it to be in their best interests and the best interests of the company for the company's common stock to be included in nasdaq/nms; and whereas, the voting shareholders deem it to be in their best interests and the best interests of the company to use all reasonable efforts to cause the board to revert to a seven member board immediately. now therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby agrees as follows: 1. board of directors the board shall immediately revert to seven directors, four of whom will be common directors and three of whom will be preferred directors. commencing immediately as of the date hereof, all matters relating to the board, including without limitation its size, composition, powers and voting with respect thereto shall be governed by the amended and
