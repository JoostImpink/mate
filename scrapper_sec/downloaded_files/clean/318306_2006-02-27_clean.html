liability which might give rise to a claim for indemnity under this agreement within sixty (60) business days of the receipt of any written claim from any such third party, but not later than twenty (20) days prior to the date any answer or responsive pleading is due, and with respect to other matters for which the 26 indemnified party may seek indemnification, give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any liability which might give rise to a claim for indemnity; provided, however, that any failure to give such notice will not waive any rights of the indemnified party except to the extent the rights of the indemnifying party are materially prejudiced. the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its election, to take over the defense or settlement of such claim by giving written notice to the indemnified party at least fifteen (15) days prior to the time when an answer or other responsive pleading or notice with respect thereto is required. if the indemnifying party

indemnified party proceed diligently to defend such claim, then the indemnified party may (after written notice to the indemnifying party), at the expense of the indemnifying party, elect to take over the defense of and proceed to handle such claim in its discretion and the indemnifying party shall be bound by any defense or settlement that the indemnified party may make in good faith with respect to such claim. in connection therewith, the indemnifying party will fully cooperate with the indemnified party should the indemnified party elect to take over the defense of any such claim. the parties agree to cooperate in defending such third party claims and the indemnified party shall provide such cooperation and such access to its books, records and properties (subject to the execution of appropriate non-disclosure agreements) as the indemnifying party shall reasonably request with respect to any matter for which indemnification is sought hereunder; and the parties hereto agree to cooperate with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense thereof. with regard to claims of third parties for which indemnification is payable hereunder, such indemnification shall be paid by the indemnifying party upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the entry of a judgment against the indemnified party and the expiration of any applicable appeal period, or if earlier, five (5) days prior to the date that the judgment creditor has the right to execute the judgment; (ii) the entry of an unappealable judgment or final appellate decision against the indemnified party; or (iii) a settlement of the claim. notwithstanding the foregoing, the reasonable expenses of counsel to the indemnified party shall be reimbursed on a current basis by the indemnifying party. with regard to

(b) mandatory conversion. if a conversion triggering event (as defined below) shall occur and within 5 business days following such occurrence, the company shall deliver a written notice to the holders of the promissory notes (the "notice") that the company intends to convert all of the outstanding promissory notes into common stock, then, subject to the limitations set forth in section 8(g) hereof, as of the date that is sixty-five days following the date that such notice is given (the "mandatory conversion date"), this note shall be converted into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing (i) the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon by (ii) the conversion rate then in effect (the "mandatory conversion"). nothing in this section 8(b) shall be construed so as to limit the right of a holder of this note to convert pursuant to section 8(a) at any time. if the maturity date occurs after the notice is duly delivered to the payee, but prior to the mandatory conversion date or the earlier conversion in full of this note, then the company shall not be obligated to repay in cash the principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and this note shall remain outstanding, as more fully described in section 8(c)(v), until such time as it is fully converted. 6 "conversion triggering event" shall mean, such time as: (i) the registration statement (as defined below) covering all of the shares of common stock into which this note is convertible is effective and sales may be made pursuant thereto (or all of the shares of common stock into which this note is convertible may be sold without restriction pursuant to rule 144(k) promulgated by the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act")); (ii) the daily market price of the common stock is at least $1.50 (subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse splits, stock dividends and the like, including, without limitation, the 1 for 5 split as such term is defined in the purchase agreement) for any period of 20 consecutive trading days; and (iii) the company has a sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the promissory notes to convert all of the promissory notes in full. "registration statement" shall have the meaning established in the investor rights agreement dated on or about the date hereof, by and among the company and the other parties signatory thereto. (c) mechanics of conversion. (i) such right of conversion shall be exercised by the payee by delivering to the company a conversion notice in the form attached hereto as exhibit a (the "conversion notice"), appropriately completed and duly signed, and by surrender not later than two (2) business days thereafter of this note. the conversion notice shall also contain a statement of the name or names (with addresses and tax identification or social security numbers) in which the certificate or certificates for common stock shall be issued, if other than the name in which this note is registered. promptly after the receipt of the conversion notice, the company shall issue and deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the payee or such payee's nominee, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion. such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date of receipt by the company of the conversion notice (the "conversion date"), and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the holder or holders of record of such shares of common stock as of the close of business on the conversion date. if the payee has not converted the entire amount of the note pursuant to the conversion notice, then the company shall execute and deliver to the payee a new note instrument identical in terms to this note, but with a principal amount reflecting the unconverted portion of this note. the new note instrument shall be delivered subject to the same timing terms as the certificates for the common stock. (ii) the company shall effect such issuance of common stock within three (3) trading days following the conversion date and shall transmit the certificates by messenger or reputable overnight delivery service to reach the address designated by such holder within 7 three (3) trading days after the receipt by the company of such conversion notice. provided that the holder complies with all of the provisions of this note relating to the conversion hereof, if certificates evidencing the common stock are not received by the holder (through no fault or negligence of the holder) within five (5) business days following the conversion date, then the holder will be entitled to revoke and withdraw its conversion notice, in whole or in part, at any time prior to its receipt of those certificates. if the conversion has not been rescinded in accordance with this paragraph and the company fails to deliver to the holder such certificate or certificates pursuant to this section 8 in accordance herewith, prior to the seventh (7th) business day after the conversion date (assuming timely surrender of the note and compliance with the other provisions of this note that relate to the conversion hereof), the company shall pay to such payee, in cash, on a per diem basis, an amount equal to 0.2% of the principal amount and all interest accrued thereon of the note until such delivery takes place and interest shall continue to accrue as provided in section 2 as if no conversion notice had been delivered. (iii) the parties acknowledge that as of the date of this note, the company does not have sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares of common stock to fully convert all of the promissory notes. subject to approval by the company's shareholders, the company will have sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares of common stock following the effectiveness of the 1 for 5 split. the company's obligation to issue common stock upon conversion of this note shall be absolute, is independent of any covenant of any payee, and shall not be subject to: (i) any offset or defense; or (ii) any claims against the holders of the promissory notes whether pursuant to this note, the certificate of incorporation of the company, the purchase agreement, the investor rights agreement (as defined in the purchase agreement), the warrants (as defined in the purchase agreement) or otherwise. (iv) subject to the provisions of section 8(g), in the event that a conversion triggering event has occurred and the company has given the notice as required by section 8(b), this note shall be converted in full on the mandatory conversion date as if the holder hereof had delivered a conversion notice with respect to this note on such date. promptly thereafter, the holder of this note shall deliver this note to the company or its duly authorized transfer agent, and upon receipt thereof, the company shall issue or cause its transfer agent to issue certificates evidencing the common stock into which this note has been converted. (v) beneficial ownership cap. to the extent that (a) all of the outstanding principal and interest due on this note is not automatically converted in full upon the occurrence of a mandatory conversion on account of the application of section 8(g), (b) a notice has been duly delivered to the payee and the maturity date has occurred prior to the mandatory conversion date specified in such notice or (c) the payee elects to convert all of the outstanding principal and interest due on this note following a prepayment notice and prior to prepayment, but all of such amounts are not converted in full on account of the application of section 8(g) (each of the events referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c), a "limited conversion"), this note shall remain outstanding with respect to the amounts of unpaid principal and unpaid interest remaining and such amounts remaining shall be deemed converted automatically under this section 8 at the first moment thereafter either when the mandatory conversion date occurs in the case of a limited conversion pursuant to clause (b) above (except that such conversion shall remain subject to section 8(g), and if section 8(g) applies, such conversion shall become a 8 clause (a) limited conversion following the mandatory conversion date), or, in all other cases, when section 8(g) would not prevent such conversion. notwithstanding the preceding sentence, upon the occurrence of the limited conversion, the rights of the payee pursuant to sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, including, without limitation, the right to be repaid principal and interest in cash, shall be terminated immediately and all other rights and obligations (including, without limitation, the rights hereunder to adjustments to the conversion rate) shall remain in full force and effect (the "remaining rights"); provided that, upon the occurrence of a sale transaction, the resulting successor or acquiring entity in such sale transaction (if not the company) and, if an entity different from the successor or acquiring entity, the entity whose capital stock or assets the holders of the common stock are entitled to receive as a result of such sale transaction, shall assume by written instrument all of the remaining rights (but not the rights that have been terminated as provided above) under the promissory notes and all of the rights and obligations of the company under transaction documents. (d) fractional shares. the company shall not be required to issue a fractional share of common stock upon conversion of this note. as to any fraction of a share which the holder of this note would otherwise be entitled to acquire upon such conversion, the company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the current market price (as defined below) per share of common stock on the date of conversion, multiplied by such fraction. "current market price" means, in respect of any share of common stock on any date herein specified: (1) if there shall not then be a public market for the common stock, the higher of (a) the book value per share of common stock at such date, and (b) the fair market value per share of common stock as determined in good faith by the board, or (2) if there shall then be a public market for the common stock, the average of the daily market prices for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately before such date. the daily market price for each such trading day shall be (i) the closing bid price on such day on the principal stock exchange (including nasdaq) on which such common stock is then listed or admitted to trading, or quoted, as applicable, (ii) if no sale takes place on such day on any such exchange, the last reported closing bid price on such day as officially quoted on any such exchange (including nasdaq), (iii) if the common stock is not then listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange, the last reported closing bid price on such day in the over-the-counter market, as furnished by the national association of securities dealers automatic quotation system or the pink sheets llc, (iv) if neither such corporation at the time is engaged in the business of reporting such prices, as furnished by any similar firm then engaged in such business, or (v) if there is no such firm, as furnished by any member of the national association of securities dealers, inc. (the "nasd") selected mutually by holders of a majority in interest of the promissory notes and the company or, if they cannot agree upon such selection, as selected by two such members of the nasd, one of which shall be selected by holders of a majority in interest of the 9 promissory notes and one of which shall be selected by the company (as applicable, the "daily market price"). (e) stock dividends, subdivisions and combinations. if at any time while the this note is outstanding, the company shall: (i) cause the holders of its common stock to be entitled to receive a dividend payable in, or other distribution of, additional shares of common stock, (ii) subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a larger number of shares of common stock, or (iii) combine its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the conversion rate shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event. any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this section 8(e) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, and any adjustment pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of this section 8(e) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. if any event requiring an adjustment under this paragraph occurs during the period that a conversion rate is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such conversion rate shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. (f) certain other distributions. if at any time while this note is outstanding the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend or other distribution of: (i) cash, (ii) any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property or assets of any nature whatsoever (other than cash or additional shares of common stock as provided in section 8(e) hereof), or (iii) any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property or assets of any nature whatsoever (in each case set forth in subparagraphs 8(f)(i), 8(f)(ii) and 8(f)(iii) hereof, the "distributed property"), then upon any conversion of this note that occurs after such record date, the holder of this note shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the conversion shares, the distributed property that such holder would have been entitled to receive in respect of such number of conversion shares had the holder been the record holder of such conversion shares as of such record date. such distribution shall be made whenever any such conversion is made. in the event that the 10 distributed property consists of property other than cash, then the fair value of such distributed property shall be as determined in good faith by the board and set forth in reasonable detail in a written valuation report (the "valuation report") prepared by the board. the company shall give written notice of such determination and a copy of the valuation report to the holder of this note, and if the holder objects to such determination within twenty (20) business days following the date such notice is given, the company shall submit such valuation to an investment banking firm of recognized national standing selected by the holder of this note and acceptable to the company in its reasonable discretion, whose opinion shall be binding upon the company and the holder of this note. a reclassification of the common stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value) into shares of common stock and shares of any other class of stock shall be deemed a distribution by the company to the holders of its common stock of such shares of such other class of stock within the meaning of this section 8(f) and, if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be changed into a larger or smaller number of shares of common stock as a part of such reclassification, such change shall be deemed a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the outstanding shares of common stock within the meaning of section 8(e). (g) blocking provision. (i) except as provided otherwise in this section 8(g)(i), the number of conversion shares that may be acquired by any holder shall be limited to the extent necessary to insure that, following such conversion, the number of shares of common stock then beneficially owned by such holder and its affiliates and any other persons or entities whose beneficial ownership of common stock would be aggregated with the holder's for purposes of section 13(d) of the exchange act (including shares held by any "group" of which the holder is a member, but excluding shares beneficially owned by virtue of the ownership of securities or rights to acquire securities that have limitations on the right to convert, exercise or purchase similar to the limitation set forth herein) does not exceed 4.99% of the total number of shares of common stock of the company then issued and outstanding (the "beneficial ownership cap"). for purposes hereof, "group" has the meaning set forth in section 13(d) of the exchange act and applicable regulations of the securities and exchange commission, and the percentage held by the holder shall be determined in a manner consistent with the provisions of section 13(d) of the exchange act. as used herein, the term "affiliate" means any person or entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by or is under common control with a person or entity, as such terms are used in and construed under rule 144 under the securities act. with respect to the holder of this note, any investment fund or managed account that is managed on a discretionary basis by the same investment manager as such holder will be deemed to be an affiliate of such holder. each delivery of a conversion notice by the holder of this note will constitute a representation by such holder that it has evaluated the limitation set forth in this paragraph and determined, subject to the accuracy of information filed under the securities act and the exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act") by the company with respect to the outstanding common stock of the company, that the issuance of the full number of shares of common stock requested in such conversion notice is permitted under this paragraph. this paragraph shall be construed and administered in such manner as shall be 11 consistent with the intent of the first sentence of this paragraph. any provision hereof which would require a result that is not consistent with such intent shall be deemed severed herefrom and of no force or effect with respect to the conversion contemplated by a particular conversion notice. (ii) in the event the company is prohibited from issuing shares of common stock as a result of any restrictions or prohibitions under applicable law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization, the company shall as soon as possible seek the approval of its stockholders and take such other action to authorize the issuance of the full number of shares of common stock issuable upon the full conversion of the promissory notes. (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of section 8(g), any holder of promissory notes shall have the right prior to the time of the closing (as defined in the purchase agreement) upon written notice to the company, or after the time of the closing upon (x) 61 days prior written notice to the company or (y) upon a sale transaction, to choose not to be governed by the beneficial ownership cap provided herein. (h) common stock reserved. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued common stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of the promissory notes, such number of shares of common stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the promissory notes at the time outstanding (without regard to any ownership limitations provided in section 8(g)); provided, that on the date of original issue of the promissory notes and prior to the effective date of the 1 for 5 split, the parties acknowledge that the company does not and will not have sufficient authorized common stock to allow for the conversion in full of the promissory notes and the exercise in full of the warrants issued pursuant to the purchase agreement. 9. other provisions applicable to adjustments. the following provisions shall be applicable to the making of adjustments of the number of shares of common stock into which this note is convertible and the current conversion rate provided for in section 8: (a) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by section 8 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring an adjustment shall occur, except that any adjustment to the conversion rate that would otherwise be required may be postponed (except in the case of a subdivision or combination of shares of the common stock, as provided for in section 8(e)) up to, but not beyond the conversion date if such adjustment either by itself or with other adjustments not previously made adds or subtracts less than 1% of the shares of common stock into which this note is convertible immediately prior to the making of such adjustment. any adjustment representing a change of less than such minimum amount (except as aforesaid) which is postponed shall be carried forward and made as soon as such adjustment, together with other adjustments required by section 8 and not previously made, would result in a minimum adjustment or on the conversion date. for the purpose of any adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. 12 (b) fractional interests. in computing adjustments under section 8, fractional interests in common stock shall be taken into account to the nearest 1/100th of a share. (c) when adjustment not required. if the company undertakes a transaction contemplated under section 8(f) and as a result takes a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights or other benefits contemplated under section 8(f) and shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders thereof, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights or other benefits contemplated under section 8(f), then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (d) escrow of stock. if after any property becomes distributable pursuant to section 8 by reason of the taking of any record of the holders of common stock, but prior to the occurrence of the event for which such record is taken, a holder of this note converts the note during such period or such holder is unable to convert pursuant to section 8(g), the holder of this note shall continue to be entitled to receive any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion under section 8 by reason of such adjustment (as if this note were not yet converted) and such shares or other property shall be held in escrow for the holder of this note by the company to be issued to holder of this note upon and to the extent that the event actually takes place. notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary herein, if the event for which such record was taken fails to occur or is rescinded, then such escrowed shares shall be canceled by the company and escrowed property returned to the company. 10. replacement. upon receipt of a duly executed, notarized and unsecured written statement from the payee with respect to the loss, theft or destruction of this note (or any replacement hereof), and, if requested by the company, an indemnity bond customary in the industry, or, in the case of a mutilation of this note, upon surrender and cancellation of such note, the company shall issue a new note, of like tenor and amount, in lieu of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated note. 11. parties in interest, transferability. this note shall be binding upon the company and its successors and

(b) indemnification by holders. each holder shall, severally and not jointly, 9 indemnify and hold harmless the company, its directors, officers, agents and employees, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act), and the directors, officers, agents and employees of such controlling persons, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all losses, as incurred, arising solely out of or based solely upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement, any prospectus, or any form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising solely out of or based solely upon any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that (i) such untrue statement or omission is contained in or omitted from any information so furnished in writing by such holder to the company specifically for inclusion in the registration statement or such prospectus and that such information was reasonably relied upon by the company for use in the registration statement, such prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or to the extent that such information relates to (x) such holder and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such holder expressly for use in the registration statement, such prospectus, or such form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (y) such holder's proposed method of distribution of registrable securities as set forth in exhibit a (or as such holder otherwise informs the company in writing), (ii) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type described in section 3(c)(c)(ii), 3(c)(c)(iii), 3(c)(c)(iv) or 3(n), the use by a holder of an outdated or defective prospectus after the delivery to the holder of written notice from the company that the prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the receipt by such holder of the advice contemplated in section 3(m) or (iii) such holder's failure to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act through no fault of the company; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 5(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any losses if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the holder shall be liable under this section 5(b) for only that amount as does not exceed the net proceeds to such holder as a result of the sale of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "indemnified party"), such indemnified party promptly shall notify the person from whom indemnity is sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, that the failure of any indemnified party to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the indemnifying party. an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such 10 proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless: (1) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; or (2) the indemnifying party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party in any such proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the reasonable expense of the indemnifying party). the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not impose any monetary or other obligation or restriction on the indemnified party. all reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnified party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this section) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within ten (10) business days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party, which notice shall be delivered no more frequently than on a monthly basis (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided, that the indemnifying party may require such indemnified party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). (d) contribution. if a claim for indemnification under section 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party because of a failure or refusal of a governmental authority to enforce such indemnification in accordance with its terms (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the 11 limitations set forth in section 5(c), any reasonable attorneys' or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this section was available to such party in accordance with its terms. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the holder shall be required to contribute under this section 5(d) for only that amount as does not exceed the net proceeds to such holder as a result of the sale of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this section are in addition to any liability that the indemnifying parties may have to the indemnified parties. the indemnity and contribution agreements herein are in addition to and not in diminution or limitation of any indemnification provisions under the purchase agreement. 6. rule 144. as long as any holder owns notes, conversion shares, warrants or warrant shares, the company covenants to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the company after the date hereof pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the exchange act. as long as any holder owns notes, conversion shares, warrants or warrant shares, if the company is not required to file reports pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the exchange act, it will prepare and furnish to the holders and make publicly available in accordance with rule 144(c) promulgated under the securities act annual and quarterly financial statements, together with a discussion and analysis of such financial statements in form and substance substantially similar to those that would otherwise be required to be included in reports required by section 13(a) or 15(d) of the exchange act, as well as any other information required thereby, in the time period that such filings would have been required to have been made under the exchange act. the company further covenants that it will take such further action as any holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such person to sell notes, conversion shares, warrants and warrant shares without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 promulgated under the securities act, including compliance with the provisions of the purchase agreement relating to the transfer of the notes, conversion shares, warrants and warrant shares. upon the request of any holder, the company shall deliver to such holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 7. miscellaneous. (a) remedies. in the event of a breach by the company or by a holder, of any of 12 their obligations under this agreement, each holder or the company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement. the company and each holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) no inconsistent agreements. except as otherwise disclosed in the purchase agreement, neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to an agreement currently in effect, nor shall the company or any of its subsidiaries, on or after the date of this agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders in this agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, other than with respect to the rights of the holders of the company's currently outstanding convertible notes and the common stock underlying such convertible notes and shares of common stock issued under the standby equity distribution agreement with cornell capital and its affiliates and shares of common stock issued to cornell capital and its affiliates in connection with such transaction, without the written consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding registrable securities, the company shall not grant to any person the right to request the company to register any securities of the company under the securities act unless the rights so granted are subject in all respects to the rights of the holders set forth herein, and are not otherwise in conflict with the provisions of this agreement. (c) notice of effectiveness. within two (2) business days after the registration statement which includes the registrable securities is ordered effective by the commission, the company shall deliver, and shall cause legal counsel for the company to deliver, to the transfer agent for such registrable securities (with copies to the holders whose registrable securities are included in such registration statement) confirmation that the registration statement has been declared effective by the commission in the form attached hereto as exhibit b. (d) piggy-back registrations. if at any time when there is not an effective registration statement covering all of the registrable securities, the company shall determine to prepare and file with the commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the securities act of any of its equity securities, other than on form s-4 or form s-8 (each as promulgated under the securities act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans and other than with respect to the rights of the holders of the company's currently outstanding warrants and convertible notes and the common stock underlying such warrants and convertible notes and the company's currently effective registration statement on form s-1 relating to its standby equity distribution agreement with cornell capital, as it may be amended from time to time, the company shall send to each holder of registrable securities written notice of such determination and, if within seven (7) business days after receipt of such notice, any such 13 holder shall so request in writing (which request shall specify the registrable securities intended to be disposed of by the holder), the company will cause the registration under the securities act of all registrable securities which the company has been so requested to register by the holder, to the extent required to permit the disposition of the registrable securities so to be registered, provided that if at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to such holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay expenses in accordance with section 4 hereof), and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any registrable securities being registered pursuant to this section 7(d) for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities. the company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such registrable securities such holder requests to be registered. in the case of an underwritten public offering, if the managing underwriter(s) or underwriter(s) should reasonably object to the inclusion of the registrable securities in such registration statement, then if the company after consultation with the managing underwriter should reasonably determine that the inclusion of such registrable securities, would materially adversely affect the offering contemplated in such registration statement, and based on such determination recommends inclusion in such registration statement of fewer or none of the registrable securities of the holders, then (x) the number of registrable securities of the holders included in such registration statement shall be reduced pro-rata among such holders (based upon the number of registrable securities requested to be included in the registration), if the company after consultation with the underwriter(s) recommends the inclusion of fewer registrable securities, or (y) none of the registrable securities of the holders shall be included in such registration statement, if the company after consultation with the underwriter(s) recommends the inclusion of none of such registrable securities; provided, however, that if securities are being offered for the account of other persons or entities as well as the company, such reduction shall not represent a greater fraction of the number of registrable securities intended to be offered by the holders than the fraction of similar reductions imposed on such other persons or entities (other than the company). (e) failure to file registration statement and other events. the company and the holders agree that the holders will suffer damages if the registration statement is not filed on or prior to the filing date and maintained in the manner contemplated herein during the effectiveness period. the company and the holders further agree that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision. accordingly, if (i) the registration statement is not filed on or prior to the filing date, or (ii) the company fails to file with the commission a request for acceleration in accordance with rule 461 promulgated under the securities act within five (5) business days of the date that the company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the commission that a registration statement will not be "reviewed," or not subject to further review, or (iii) the registration statement is filed with and declared effective by the commission but thereafter ceases to be effective as to all registrable securities at any time prior to the expiration of the effectiveness period, without being succeeded immediately by a subsequent registration 14 statement filed with the commission, except as otherwise permitted by this agreement, including pursuant to section 3(n), or (iv) trading in the common stock shall be suspended or if the common stock is delisted from each securities exchange, quotation system, market or over-the-counter bulletin board on which registrable securities are required hereunder to be listed (each an "exchange"), without immediately being listed on any other exchange, for any reason for more than five (5) business days, other than pursuant to section 3(n), or (v) the company refuses or fails to effect any conversion of the notes into conversion shares or any exercise of warrants into warrant shares in accordance with the terms of the notes and warrants for any reason without the consent of the particular holder (any such failure or breach being referred to as an "event"), the company shall pay in cash as liquidated damages for such failure and not as a penalty to each holder an amount equal to two percent (2%) of such holder's subscription amount for the initial thirty (30) day period until the applicable event has been cured, which shall be pro rated for such periods less than thirty (30) days and two percent (2%) of such holder's subscription amount for each subsequent thirty (30) day period until the applicable event has been cured which shall be pro rated for such periods less than thirty days (the "periodic amount"). payments to be made pursuant to this section 7(e) shall be due and payable immediately upon demand in immediately available cash funds. the parties agree that the periodic amount represents a reasonable estimate on the part of the parties, as of the date of this agreement, of the amount of damages that may be incurred by the holders if the registration statement is not filed on or prior to the filing date and maintained in the manner contemplated herein during the effectiveness period or if any other event as described herein has occurred. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall remain obligated to cure the breach or correct the condition that caused the event, and the holder shall have the right to take any action necessary or desirable to enforce such obligation. each holder of registrable securities acknowledges that, notwithstanding any provision of this agreement, no damages shall be payable in connection with the company's imposition of a blackout period in accordance with section 3(n) of this agreement. (f) specific enforcement, consent to jurisdiction. (i) the company and the holders acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or cure breaches of the provisions of this agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any of them may be entitled by law or equity. (ii) each of the company and the holders (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in new york city, new york for the purposes of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement and (ii) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such court, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper. each of the company and the holders consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding 15 by mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. nothing in this section 7(f) shall affect or limit any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. (g) amendments and waivers. the provisions of this agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the company and the holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of holders and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other holders may be given by holders of the registrable securities to which such waiver or consent relates; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.
