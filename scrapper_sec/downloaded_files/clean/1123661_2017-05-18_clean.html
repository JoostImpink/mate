purpose of the transactions described in this statement is for chemchina, through cnac saturn (nl), to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, syngenta. the offers, as the first step in the acquisition of syngenta, are intended to facilitate the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares. as noted above, the main offer period (as that term is defined in the u.s. offer to purchase) expired at 10:00 a.m., new york city time, on may 4, 2017. as of the expiration of the main offer period, a total of 75,925,206 shares had been tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offers, representing approximately 82.2% of the shares (excluding treasury shares held by syngenta or its subsidiaries). on may 18, 2017, cnac saturn (nl) accepted for payment, in accordance with the terms of the offers, all shares that were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the main offer period. in accordance the terms of the transaction agreement, syngenta will hold a general meeting of shareholders (&#147; gm &#148;) on june 26, 2017 and discharge the eight members of its current board of directors (the &#147; board &#148;), including the chairman. syngenta will propose and recommend the election to the syngenta board of directors as chairman, ren jianxin, as vice-chairman, michel demar&eacute;, and as members, three additional individuals that are current members of the board, who will be j&uuml;rg witmer, eveline saupper and gunnar brock, and three additional individuals proposed by chemchina, who will be hongbo chen, olivier t. de clermont-tonnerre and dieter a. gericke. the current members of the board who will not be proposed for re-election have each signed a resignation declaration effective as of the end of the gm. pursuant to the transaction agreement, chemchina may expand the size of the board to ten members, six of whom would be proposed by chemchina and the other four of whom would be independent, having no affiliation with chemchina or its affiliates other than their position as board members and meeting the independence criteria of the swiss code of best practices for corporate governance. as more fully described in the u.s. offer to purchase, certain decisions of the board will require, in addition to the simple majority of votes of the members present (with the chairman of the board having the casting vote in case of a tie), the consent of at least two directors who are independent (as described above in this paragraph). in addition, a new committee consisting of independent directors (as described above in this paragraph) will be established to approve any transaction between syngenta and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and chemchina or its affiliates, on the other hand. 12 as noted above, on may 11, 2017, cnac saturn (nl) commenced the subsequent offer period (as that term is defined in the u.s. offer to purchase), which will expire at 10:00 a.m., new york city time, on may 24, 2017. on june 7, 2017, cnac saturn (nl) expects to accept for payment, in accordance with the terms of the offers, all shares that were validly tendered prior to the expiration of the subsequent offer period. chemchina and cnac saturn (nl) intend that, as soon as practicable after the consummation of the offers, a squeeze-out action will be carried out with respect to the remaining publicly held shares of syngenta. in the event that chemchina and/or its subsidiaries hold more than 98% of the voting rights in syngenta after the consummation of the offers, cnac saturn (nl) intends to request the cancellation of the remaining publicly held shares in accordance with article 137 of the financial markets infrastructure act of switzerland. the remaining minority shareholders subject to such squeeze-out action do not have appraisal rights in connection with the consideration to be paid in such squeeze-out action. in the event that chemchina and/or its subsidiaries hold between (and including) 90% and (and including) 98% of the voting rights in syngenta after the consummation of the offers, cnac saturn (nl) intends to merge syngenta with a company directly or indirectly controlled by chemchina in accordance with article 8 paragraph 2 and article 18 paragraph 5 of the swiss merger act, whereby the remaining public shareholders of syngenta would be compensated (in cash or otherwise) and not receive any shares in the surviving company. a minority shareholder subject to the squeeze-out merger may seek to claim, within two months of the publication of the squeeze-out merger, that the consideration offered in such squeeze-out merger is inadequate and petition a competent swiss court to determine what consideration is adequate. in the event that chemchina and/or its subsidiaries hold less than 90% of the voting rights in syngenta after the consummation of the offers, chemchina and cnac saturn (nl) may consider, depending on the circumstances, purchasing additional shares from remaining shareholders of syngenta and/or combining relevant portions of their relevant businesses with syngenta through a contribution in kind to syngenta of assets, businesses or shareholdings in connection with a capital increase. in the event of such a transaction, the pre-emptive rights of the shareholders of syngenta would be withdrawn and new shares issued only to the contributing company. furthermore, cnac saturn (nl) may consider implementing one or several other transactions under the swiss merger act. as a result of the transactions described in this statement and as soon as practicable after the consummation of the offers, chemchina intends to cause syngenta to delist the common shares and adss from the six swiss exchange and the new york stock exchange, respectively (after which there will be no public market for the shares), to suspend certain of its disclosure and reporting obligations and to terminate its registration under the act. references to,
