&#160; &#160; &#160; during the standstill period, so long as the corporation and its affiliates have complied with their obligations under the investor rights agreement and the purchase agreement, the issuer will not, without the corporation&#8217;s consent, put in place any stockholder rights plan or similar poison pill that would prohibit the corporation, the company and any wholly owned subsidiary of the company, any person of which the corporation and the company are wholly owned subsidiaries, any other wholly owned subsidiary of any such person and any controlled affiliate of any of the foregoing (the &#8220;

&#160; &#160; &#160; participate and receive the same consideration per share for each such share of company common stock unless it is confirmed at the time such offer is made that such acquisition shall be subject to, and conditioned upon, the review and approval of a special committee of independent directors of the board. &#160; the foregoing description of the investor rights agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the investor rights agreement, which is filed as exhibit&#160;2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. &#160; certificate of designations &#160; on december 6, 2011, the issuer filed the certificate of designations with the secretary of state of the state of delaware setting forth, among other things, the designation, preferences, dividends, voting rights and other special rights of the series a preferred stock. &#160; the certificate of designations provides that the holder of the series a preferred stock (the &#8220; holder &#8221;) will initially be entitled to designate for election and elect two individuals to the board.&#160;&#160;for as long as the holder is entitled to designate two series a designees, if the size of the board is increased to fifteen directors or greater, then the number of series a designees will be increased to the number (rounding down to the nearest whole number) resulting from multiplying (x) the percentage of then-outstanding shares of the company common stock owned by the corporation and certain of its affiliates (the &#8220; investor group &#8221;) by (y) the number of directors comprising the board after giving effect to that increase.&#160;&#160;the holder will only continue to be entitled to designate two or more series a designees for as long as the investor group owns all of the purchased shares (and has not entered into any of certain hedging transactions related to the class a common stock (any such transaction, a &#8220; hedging transaction &#8221;)), subject to certain dispositions required to comply with applicable law. if the investor group no longer owns all of the purchased shares (or has entered into a hedging transaction), the holder may designate one series a designee for as long as the j. c. penney group owns at least 66 2/3% of the purchased shares (and has not entered into a hedging transaction with respect to such shares).&#160;&#160;following the first time that the investor group fails to own at least 66 2/3% of the purchased shares (reduced by the number of purchased shares subject to a hedging transaction), the holder will no longer have the right to designate series a designees for election to the board. &#160; subject to applicable law and securities exchange rules and regulations, at any time during which the holder has the right to designate two or more series a designees for election to the board, there will be at least one series a designee included as a member of any committee of the board, except for special committees established for potential conflict of interest situations the nature of which is such that membership thereon by a series a designee would be inappropriate, as determined in good faith by the board, and except that only series a designees who qualify under the applicable rules and regulations of the applicable securities exchange and the securities and exchange commission may serve on committees where such qualification is required. &#160; in addition to any other vote or consent of a holder of the series a preferred stock as required by law or by the issuer&#8217;s certificate of incorporation, without the prior written consent 10 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; of the holder, the issuer will not amend, alter or repeal (whether by amendment, merger or consolidation or otherwise) any provision of the issuer&#8217;s certificate of incorporation or the certificate of designations so as to adversely affect the series a preferred stock or authorize the issuance of additional shares of series a preferred stock; provided that any amendment or alteration to the certificate of incorporation or any related certificate of designations to (i) increase the number of authorized shares of any class or series of capital stock of the issuer (other than the series a preferred stock) or (ii) incorporate the terms of a new class or series of capital stock of the issuer that does not modify the rights and obligations of the series a preferred stock set forth in the certificate of designations will not be deemed to adversely affect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of the series a preferred stock. &#160; upon the occurrence of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the series a preferred stock or a merger or consolidation of the issuer, so long as the investor group owns or is deemed to own all of the purchased shares (and has not entered into a hedging transaction with respect to purchased shares), other than certain dispositions required to comply with applicable law, the holder will continue to have the right to designate one or more directors to the&#160;board of directors of the issuer or the surviving or resulting entity, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions regarding the investor group&#8217;s level of ownership of the issuer or such surviving or resulting entity immediately following the consummation of such transaction. &#160; the share(s) of series a preferred stock will be cancelled upon the earliest to occur of (i) an event resulting in such share(s) of series a preferred stock not being owned of record and beneficially only by the corporation or another member of the investor group, (ii) such time as the holder no longer has the right to designate any series a designees and (iii) the completion of the distribution of the issuer&#8217;s remaining assets following the dissolution and winding up of the issuer. &#160; upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the issuer, the holder is entitled to receive for each share of series a preferred stock held thereby, an amount equal to $0.01 (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits or the like with respect to such shares), before any payment or distribution is made in respect of any company common stock. &#160; the foregoing description of the certificate of designations does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the certificate of designations, which is filed as exhibit&#160;3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. &#160;

(iv) &#160; the indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any third party, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification could be sought under this section 7.1, unless the indemnified parties fail to assume the defense of such litigation, investigation or proceeding pursuant to section 7.1(e)(ii) and (2) such settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment (x) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified parties from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of 24 &#160;

(b) &#160; to the extent permitted by law, each holder will, with respect to any registrable securities which are included in a registration statement pursuant to section 2.1 or section 2.2, indemnify, severally and not jointly, the company, each of its directors, officers, partners and members, each underwriter, if any, of the company&#8217;s securities covered by such a registration, each person who controls the company or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and each other holder and each of such holder&#8217;s officers, directors, partners and members who have signed the registration statement and each person controlling such holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act (collectively, the &#8220; holder indemnified parties &#8221;), against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to 14 &#160;

(c) &#160; each party entitled to indemnification under this section 2.6 (the &#8220; indemnified party &#8221;) shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the &#8220; indemnifying party &#8221;) promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought (including any governmental action), and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided , however , that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party&#8217;s expense; provided further , however , that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to conflicting interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.&#160;&#160;the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 2.6 if, but only to the extent that, the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial or harmful to an indemnifying party&#8217;s ability to defend such action.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.&#160;&#160;the indemnity agreements 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; contained in this section 2.6 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. &#160; (d) &#160; if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.6 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party, other than pursuant to its terms, with respect to any claim, loss, damage, liability or action referred to therein, then, subject to the limitations contained in section 2.6(e), the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such claim, loss, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the actions that resulted in such claims, loss, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.&#160;&#160;the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact related to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.&#160;&#160;the company and the holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.6(d) were based solely upon the number of entities from whom contribution was requested or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this section 2.6(d).&#160;in no event shall any holder&#8217;s contribution obligation under this section 2.6(d) exceed the amount of the net proceeds actually received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities included in such registration. &#160; (e) &#160; no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160; (f) &#160; notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions of section 2.6, the provisions in the underwriting agreement will control; provided , however , that to the extent such underwriting agreement does not address a matter addressed by this agreement, that failure to address such matter shall not be deemed a conflict between the provisions of this agreement and the underwriting agreement. &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by such holder of any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, exchange act or state securities law applicable to such holder and will reimburse each of the holder indemnified parties for any reasonable out-of-pocket legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, as such expenses are incurred, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder and stated to be specifically for use therein, provided , however , that in no event shall any indemnity under this section&#160;2.6(b) payable by a holder exceed the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities included in such registration exceeds the amount of any other losses, expenses, settlements, damages, claims and liabilities that such holder has been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.&#160;&#160;the indemnity agreement contained in this section 2.6 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the applicable holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), nor shall the holder be liable for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action where such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was corrected in a final or amended prospectus, and the company or the underwriters failed to deliver a copy of the final or amended prospectus at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities to the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability in any case in which such delivery is required by the securities act &#160; (c) &#160; each party entitled to indemnification under this section 2.6 (the &#8220; indemnified party &#8221;) shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the &#8220; indemnifying party &#8221;) promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought (including any governmental action), and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided , however , that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party&#8217;s expense; provided further , however , that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to conflicting interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.&#160;&#160;the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 2.6 if, but only to the extent that, the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial or harmful to an indemnifying party&#8217;s ability to defend such action.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.&#160;&#160;the indemnity agreements 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; contained in this section 2.6 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. &#160; (d) &#160; if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.6 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party, other than pursuant to its terms, with respect to any claim, loss, damage, liability or action referred to therein, then, subject to the limitations contained in section 2.6(e), the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such claim, loss, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the actions that resulted in such claims, loss, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.&#160;&#160;the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact related to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.&#160;&#160;the company and the holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.6(d) were based solely upon the number of entities from whom contribution was requested or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this section 2.6(d).&#160;in no event shall any holder&#8217;s contribution obligation under this section 2.6(d) exceed the amount of the net proceeds actually received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities included in such registration. &#160; (e) &#160; no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160;

provided , however , that to the extent such underwriting agreement does not address a matter addressed by this agreement, that failure to address such matter shall not be deemed a conflict between the provisions of this agreement and the underwriting agreement. &#160;

(e) &#160; (a) each series a designee shall be entitled to the same compensation and same indemnification and insurance coverage in connection with his or her role as a director of the corporation as are generally made available to all of the members of the board of directors who are not series a designees and are also not officers or employees of the corporation or its subsidiaries, and each series a designee shall be entitled to reimbursement for his or her reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the board of directors or any committees thereof, to the same extent as other members of the board of directors who are not series a designees or officers or employees of the corporation or its subsidiaries (it being understood that a series&#160;a designee may, at his or her option, waive any entitlement to compensation for service as a director of the corporation); (b) the corporation shall notify each series a designee of all regular and special meetings of the board of directors and shall notify each series a designee of all regular and special meetings of any committee of the board of directors of which such series a designee is a member;

provided that, if the corporation subsequent class a percentage or the successor class a percentage, as applicable, with respect to such designated transaction or surviving transaction is less than 10%, then the committee rights in section 3(c) shall terminate;

shall be deemed to have been changed to refer instead to &#8220;one (1) series a designee&#8221;, and such changes shall be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to, but conditioned upon, such consummation (and such designation rights shall remain in effect only so long as the investor group owns (and has continuously owned) of record, in the aggregate, all of the purchased shares (and has not entered into any hedging transaction with respect to all or any portion thereof)); or &#160; (iii) &#160; if neither the condition in clause (i) of this section&#160;3(i) nor the condition in clause&#160;(ii) of this section&#160;3(i) is satisfied, the holder shall no longer have the right to designate series a designees for election to the board of directors (and the loss of such right shall be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to, but shall be conditioned upon, such consummation) and the cancellation time shall be deemed to have occurred. 8 &#160;
