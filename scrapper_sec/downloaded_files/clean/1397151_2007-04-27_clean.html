gas, l.p. (&#147; southern bay &#148;) and pica energy, llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of cel (&#147;pica&#148;), were each respectively merged with two subsidiaries of the issuer (the &#147; mergers &#148;), which were formed for that purpose. the merger agreement provided in substance for the mergers of the business of southern bay and cel, each of which was an independent oil and gas exploration and development company, into these two subsidiaries. to accomplish the merger of cel&#146;s business, cel transferred all but a small portion of its business and assets to pica on april 17, 2007, and pica was immediately merged into the issuer&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, chandler acquisition, llc. in the mergers, the issuer issued a total of 1,645,771 shares of common stock to cel, consisting of (a) 31,329 shares to cel as a limited partner of southern bay, in exchange for 100% of cel&#146;s limited partnership interests in southern bay, and (b) 1,614,382 shares to cel in exchange for 100% of cel&#146;s membership interests of pica. of these 1,645,771 shares, 50,000 shares were granted to four cel employees. item 4. purpose of the transaction the purpose of the transactions discussed in item 3 above was to complete the mergers. the mergers resulted in a change of control of the issuer, and its board of directors and executive officers now include mr. chandler and several persons appointed by southern bay. other than the transactions discussed above, the reporting persons are not aware of any plans, or proposals or arrangements which may, at a future date, result in a change of control of the issuer or any actions described in item 4 of schedule 13d. cusip no. 372476 10 1 page 5 item 5. interest in securities of the issuer the number of shares of common stock of the issuer issued to cel in its name in the mergers was 1,595,711, or 10.9% of the issued and outstanding stock of the issuer at the conclusion of the mergers on april 17, 2007. because mr. chandler owns 100% of cel, he may be deemed the beneficial owner of all of such shares. in addition, in connection with the mergers, on april 17, 2007 four employees of cel received a total of 50,000 shares of common stock, amounting to an additional 0.3% of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock, as merger consideration. of these 50,000 shares, 25,000 are subject to additional vesting requirements and may be reallocated by cel to cel employees, including mr. chandler, in the event the shares do not vest. the four employees of cel entered into a stock grant and shareholder agreement (the &#147; shareholder agreement &#148;) among themselves and cel. pursuant to the shar eholder agreement, the employees agreed to vote their shares in accordance with the directions of cel until december 31, 2009. the four employees have the right to sell the 25,000 shares in the aggregate that are fully vested but do not have the right to sell the 25,000 shares that are not fully vested. therefore, mr. chandler and cel each beneficially own the shares subject to the shareholder agreement by virtue of their ability to vote the shares held by the four cel employees, or, in total, 11.3% of the issued and outstanding common stock. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer in addition to the shareholder agreement discussed in item 5 above, cel entered into an agreement with morrison enterprises llc (&#147;
