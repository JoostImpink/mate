and february 28, 1997 (the "share- holder's agreement"), which sets forth certain terms governing rakepoll finance's investment in the company, including, among other things, (i) rakepoll finance's representation on the company's board of directors (the "board"), (ii) certain changes in company management, (iii) the establishment and composition of a company executive operating committee, (iii) special approvals required for certain board actions and (iv) certain restrictions and rights with respect to rakepoll finance's ability to purchase or dispose of company securities. rakepoll finance intends to influence and participate in the management and policies of the company to the fullest extent permitted by delaware general corporation law and by the shareholder's agreement, as described below. pursuant to the terms of the shareholder's agreement, the company is presently obligated to have ten members on the board and to use its best efforts to cause the board to consist of (i) two directors who are executive officers of the company and not affiliated with rakepoll finance ("management directors"), (ii) three directors designated by rakepoll finance ("investor directors") and (iii) five independent directors to be designated jointly by the management directors and the investor directors ("independent directors"); provided, however, that the number of investor directors and independent directors which rakepoll finance is entitled to designate, jointly or otherwise, shall be reduced in proportion to certain reductions in rakepoll finance's percentage equity interest in the company; and provided, further, that rakepoll finance's right so to designate any investor director or independent director shall terminate in the event that rakepoll finance's percentage equity interest in the company is less than 10% of its percentage equity interest in the company on and as of the closing date (its "initial interest"). further, if, under certain circumstances, the holders of certain company preferred stock become entitled to appoint two directors to the board (the "preferred directors"), then for so long as such holders are entitled to designate the preferred directors, the board shall be increased from ten to 12 directors and rakepoll finance shall thereafter be entitled to designate an additional investor director and one management director shall resign. on february 28, in connection with the consummation of the stock exchange and in furtherance of the foregoing, the following individuals were elected to the board: (i) carlo salvi, chairman of the board of rakepoll finance, (ii) michael d. cannon, executive vice-president of the company and an officer and director of sicor-societa italiana corticosteriodi s.p.a., a indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, (iii) patrick d. walsh, president and chief operating officer of gensia laboratories, ltd., and (iv) donald e. panoz, executive chairman of the board of fountainhead holdings ltd. and of fountainhead development corp. and non-executive chairman of the board of warner chilcott plc. the shareholder's agreement also requires that all necessary action be taken to cause (i) the designation of an independent director to serve as non-executive chairman of the board upon the mutual agreement of the investor directors and management directors, (ii) the appointment of david f. hale as president and chief executive officer of the company, and (iii) the appointment of michael d. cannon to serve as executive vice-president of the company. on february 28, 1997, in connection with the consummation of the stock exchange and in furtherance of the foregoing, the board elected donald panoz to serve as chairman of the board. on the same date, the board also appointed david f. hale and michael d. cannon to the offices of the company described in the foregoing paragraph. the shareholder's agreement further obligates the company to establish an executive operating committee, which shall be a management committee and not a committee of the board, consisting of carlo salvi (who shall serve as chairman of such committee), the president and chief executive officer of the company, the president of gensia laboratories, ltd. and the executive vice-president of the company. in connection with the consummation of the stock exchange and in furtherance of the foregoing, the company has formed an executive operating committee comprised of the following individuals: carlo salvi, david f. hale, patrick d. walsh and michael d. cannon. the shareholder's agreement further provides that, as long as rakepoll finance's percentage equity interest in the company is 50% or greater than its initial interest, the approval of the investor directors will be required in order for the company to take certain corporate actions, including (i) the entry of the company or any of its subsidiaries into any merger or consolidation, or the acquisition by any thereof of any business or assets which would constitute a substantial part of the business or assets of the company, (ii) the disposition by the company or any of its subsidiaries of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the company, (iii) certain actions related to dissolution, liquidation or bankruptcy, (iv) the payment of an extraordinary dividend by the company, (v) the issuance of any debt or equity securities of the company in excess of a certain amount and (vi) the issuance of any debt or equity securities or other capital stock of any company subsidiaries, except certain issuances pursuant to certain benefit or other plans approved by the board or pursuant to the terms of certain company securities outstanding on the closing date. for a period of twelve months after the closing date, under the terms of the shareholder's agreement, rakepoll finance and its affiliates are prohibited from acquiring or offering to acquire any company securities, except (i) with the consent of a majority of the independent directors, (ii) in the event of any issuance by the company of any equity securities not contemplated by the funding plan previously agreed to by rakepoll finance and the company or (iii) under certain circumstances, following (a) the commencement by any third party of a bona fide tender or exchange offer to purchase in excess of 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock, (b) a bona fide proposal to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of the company, (c) a bona fide proposal to enter into any other similar business combination with the company or (d) a definitive agreement, or an agreement contemplating a definitive agreement, for any of the transactions described in clauses (iii)(a)-(c) above. rakepoll finance is also prohibited by the shareholder's agreement, for a period of twelve months after the closing date, from (i) disposing of any shares of common stock (and from permitting any affiliate thereof to do so) and (ii) disposing of any shares of the capital stock of any subsidiary thereof that owns shares of common stock, except to an affiliate of rakepoll finance that agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the shareholder's agreement. the foregoing restrictions do not apply following the commencement by any third party of a bona fide tender or exchange offer to purchase in excess of 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock that the board either recommends acceptance of, expresses no opinion and remains neutral towards, or is unable to take a position with respect to. in addition, the shareholder's agreement grants rakepoll finance certain anti-dilution privileges pursuant to which rakepoll finance, may, upon the authorization by the board of the issuance of certain equity securities, acquire in the open market such number of shares of common stock so that rakepoll finance's percentage equity interest in the company after such issuance is equal to but not greater than its initial interest. finally, the shareholder's agreement provides that, at any time on or after the first anniversary of the closing date, the holders of common stock subject to the shareholder's agreement constituting at least 5% of the aggregate common stock outstanding immediately upon consummation of the stock exchange (the "initiating holders") may request that the company file a registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), covering the registration of the registrable securities (generally defined in the shareholder's agreement to include common stock and other securities convertible into such stock, acquired by rakepoll finance in accordance with the stock exchange and shareholder's agreements). the company is thereupon obligated to use its best efforts to cause the registration under the act of all registrable securities requested by the initiating holders and certain other holders of common stock which elect to participate in such registration; provided, that the company shall not be obligated to cause the filing of more than two effective registration statements per year up to a maximum of five effective registration statements. in addition, under the terms of the stock exchange agreement, rakepoll finance and the company have also agreed that they presently intend that certain medical device products and research activities of the company shall be transferred to other companies. the company shall contribute to automedics development, inc., a subsidiary of the company, the assets, licenses, contracts, intellectual property and other associated rights related to certain existing company medical device products and any medical device products in-licensed by the company between the date of the stock exchange agreement and the closing date. rakepoll finance and the company have also agreed that, subsequent to the closing date, they will use their best efforts to present to the board a plan to effectuate the spin-off of the company's research activities into an independent company, so long as such spin-off is reasonably feasible. in connection with the consummation of the stock exchange, the company was obligated to make certain amendments to the form of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws on or prior to the closing date. amendments to the company's certificate of incorporation (the "certificate of incorporation") included (i) a name change from "gensia, inc." to "gensia sicor inc.", (ii) an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from

(b) if the initiating holders intend to have the registrable securities distributed by means of an underwritten offering, the company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in clause (x) of section 6.1(a) above. in such event, the right of any holder to include its registrable securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwritten offering and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwritten offering (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the initiating holders and such holder) to the extent provided below. all holders proposing to distribute registrable securities through such underwritten offering shall enter (together with the company, as provided in subsection 6.4(j)) into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters. no holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such holder, the registrable securities of such holder and such holder's intended method of distribution and any other representations required by law or reasonably required by the underwriter. if any holder of registrable securities disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw all its registrable securities by written notice to the company, the managing underwriter and the initiating holders. the securities so withdrawn also shall be withdrawn from registration. (c) a registration requested pursuant to this section 6.1 shall not be deemed to have been effected pursuant this section 6.1 for purposes of section 6.6 unless (i) it has been declared effective by the sec, (ii) it has remained effective for the period set forth in section 6.4(a), and (iii) the offering of registrable securities pursuant to such registration is not subject to any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the sec (other than any such stop order, injunction, or other requirement of the sec prompted by any act or omission of holders of registrable securities).

(e) subject to the following sentence, if a requested registration pursuant to this section 6.1 involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter advises the company in writing that, in its opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration (including securities of the company which are not registrable securities) exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, the company will include in such registration only the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration. in the event that the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, may be sold at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, the number of such registrable securities to be included in such registration shall be allocated pro rata among all requesting holders on the basis of the relative number of shares of registrable securities then held by each such holder (provided that any shares hereby allocated to any such holder that exceed such holder's request shall be reallocated among the remaining requesting holders in like manner). in the event that the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration is less than the number which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, may be sold at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, the company may include in such registration the securities the company proposes to sell up to the number of securities that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, may be sold at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities. the company will not include in any requested registration pursuant to this section 6.1 any securities which are not registrable securities (other than securities of the company) without the prior written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities included in such registration. (f) if the board of directors of the company, in its good faith judgment, determines that any registration of registrable securities should not be made or continued due to a valid need not to disclose confidential information or because it would materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or merger or other transaction involving the company (collectively, a "valid business reason"), the company may postpone filing a registration statement relating to a request for registration under this section 6.1 for a period of up to 90 days from the date of the delay notice (as defined herein). if any such registration statement has been filed, the company may, with respect to a registration effected pursuant to this section 6.1 or section 6.3, postpone amending or supplementing such registration statement for a period of up to 90 days from the date of the delay notice. if the company decides to postpone filing a registration statement or an amendment or supplement thereto, then the company shall give prompt written notice (a "delay notice") to any holder of registrable securities included or to be included in any such registration statement of its determination to postpone a registration statement. to be valid, a delay notice shall include in reasonable detail the nature of the valid business reasons occasioning such postponement. in addition, if prior to the end of the 90-day delay period the valid business reason should cease to exist, then the company shall give prompt written notice to those parties to whom a delay notice was delivered stating that the valid business reason for such postponement no longer exists. notwithstanding the foregoing, and without regard to whether the valid business reason continues or not, at the end of the 90-day period from the delivery of a delay notice, the company shall cause such registration statement, amendment or supplement, to be filed with the sec. notwithstanding the foregoing the company shall be entitled to serve only one delay notice within any 12 month period. section 6.2. incidental registration. subject to section 6.7, if at any time after the first anniversary of the closing date the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act (other than a registration statement on a form s-4 or s-8 or any successor or similar forms) on any form that would permit the registration of the registrable securities, whether or not such filing is to be on its behalf, each such time the company shall give to each holder prompt written notice of such determination setting forth the date on which the company proposes to file such registration statement, which date shall be no earlier than twenty- one days from the date of such notice, and advising each holder of its right under this section 6.2 to have registrable securities included in such registration. upon the written request of any holder received by the company no later than thirty days after the date of the company's notice (which request shall specify the registrable securities intended to be included in such registration by such holder), the company shall use its best efforts to cause to be registered under the securities act all of the registrable securities that each such holder has so requested to be registered; provided that if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to proceed with the proposed registration of the securities to be sold by it, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each holder of registrable securities and, thereupon, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay the registration expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any holder to request such registration to be effected as a registration under section 6.1. if a proposed registration pursuant to this section 6.2 involves an underwritten public offering, any holders making a request under this section 6.2 in connection with such registration may elect in writing, prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, to withdraw such request and not to have such securities registered in connection with such registration. if, in the written opinion of the managing underwriter (or, in the case of a non-underwritten offering, in the written opinion of the company), the total amount of such securities to be so registered, including such registrable securities, will exceed the maximum amount of the company's securities that can be marketed at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, then the company shall include in such registration (i) first, all the securities the company proposes to sell for its own account or is required to register on behalf of any third party exercising rights similar to those granted in section 6.1(a) and without having the adverse effect referred to above, and (ii) second, to the extent that the number of securities which the company proposes to sell for its own account pursuant to this section 6.2, or is required to register on behalf of any third party exercising rights similar to those granted in section 6.1(a), is less than the number of equity securities which the company has been advised can be sold in such offering without having the adverse effect referred to above, all registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the holders pursuant to this section 6.2 and all shares of common stock requested to be included by third parties exercising the rights similar to those granted in this section 6.2; provided that if the number of registrable securities and other shares of common stock requested to be included in such registration by the holders pursuant to this section 6.2 and third parties exercising rights similar to those granted in this section 6.2, together with the number of securities to be included in such registration pursuant to clause (i) of this section 6.2, exceeds the number which the company has been advised can be sold in such offering without having the adverse effect referred to above, the number of such registerable securities requested to be included in such registration by the holders pursuant to this section 6.2 shall be limited to such extent and shall be allocated pro rata among all such requesting holders and third parties exercising rights similar to those granted in this section 6.2 on the basis of the relative number of registrable securities each such holder has requested to be included in such registration and the number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such registration by such third parties. section 6.3. registration on form s-3. if at any time after the first anniversary of the closing date (a) any holder requests in writing that the company file a registration statement on form s-3 or any successor thereto for a public offering of all or any portion of the registrable securities held by such requesting holder and (b) the company is a registrant entitled to use form s-3 or any successor thereto, then the company shall use its best efforts to register under the securities act on form s-3 or any successor thereto, for public sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified in such request, including, without limitation, pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act, the registrable securities specified in such request. whenever the company is required by this section 6.3 to use its best efforts to effect the registration of registrable securities, each of the limitations, procedures and requirements of section 6.1(b), (e) and (f) (including but not limited to the requirement that the company notify all holders from whom a request has not been received and provide them with the opportunity to participate in the offering) shall apply to such registration. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this section 6.3: (i) if the holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the company entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell registrable securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the public (net of any underwriters' discounts or commissions) of less than $10,000,000;

provided, however, that any period of time during which a holder must discontinue disposition of registrable securities shall not be included in the determination of a period of distribution for purposes of sections 6.4(a) and 6.4(b). section 6.5. furnish information. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to this agreement that the holders shall furnish to the company such information regarding themselves, the registrable securities held by them, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as the company may from time to time reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with the action to be taken by the company. section 6.6. expenses of registration. all registration expenses in connection with (i) each registration or attempted registration pursuant to section 6.2, (ii) the first five registrations effected pursuant to section 6.1 or 6.3 and (iii) any attempted registration (or partial registration deemed not to have been effected pursuant to section 6.1 or 6.3 by operation of sections 6.1(c) or (e)) occurring prior to the fifth registration effected pursuant to section 6.1 or 6.3 of this agreement, excluding underwriters' discounts and commissions, shall be paid by the company; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay for any registration expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to section 6.1 or 6.3 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be registered (in which case all participating holders shall bear such expenses), unless the holders of a majority of the registrable securities agree to forfeit their right to one demand registration pursuant to section 6.1; provided further, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business or prospects of the company not actually known by the holders at the time of their request for registration, then the holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain in full their rights pursuant to sections 6.1 and 6.3. the foregoing provisions with respect to expenses shall in no way limit the rights of the holders to request registration pursuant to sections 6.1 and 6.3 or the number of registrations which may be requested thereunder. section 6.7. underwriting requirements. in connection with any underwritten offering, the company shall not be required under section 6.2 to include registrable securities in such underwritten offering unless the holders of such registrable securities accept the terms of the underwriting of such offering that have been reasonably agreed upon between the company and the underwriters selected by the company; provided, that the company shall not agree to lock-up periods in excess of 120 days in connection with any such offerings. section 6.8. rule 144 and rule 144a information. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the sec which may at any time permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, at all times, the company agrees to: (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act; (ii) use its best efforts to file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act; and (iii) furnish to each holder of registrable securities forthwith upon request a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of such rule 144 and of the securities act and the exchange act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents so filed by the company as such holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the sec allowing such holder to sell any registrable securities without registration. section 6.9. delay of registration. no holder, other than rakepoll, shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this article vi. section 6.10. indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under this agreement: (a) the company shall indemnify and hold harmless each holder, such holder's directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls such holder or participating person within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) to which they may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based on any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 6.10(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided further that the company shall not be liable to any holder, such holder's directors and officers or controlling person in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in connection with such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such holder, such holder's directors and officers or controlling person; provided, further, that as to any preliminary prospectus or any final prospectus this indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any holder, such holder's directors and officers or controlling persons on account of any losses, claims, damages or liability arising from the sale of common stock to any person by such holder if such holder or its representatives failed to send or give a copy of the final prospectus or a prospectus supplement, as the case may be (excluding documents incorporated by reference therein), as the same may be amended or supplemented, to that person within the time required by the securities act, and the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus was corrected in the final prospectus or such prospectus supplement, as the case may be (excluding documents incorporated by reference therein), unless such failure resulted from non-compliance by the company with section 6.4(c). such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any such holder, such holder's directors and officers, participating person or controlling person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such holder. (b) each holder requesting or joining in a registration severally and not jointly shall indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to the holders but only with reference to written information relating to such holder furnished to the company expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 6.10(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of such holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided further that the liability of each holder hereunder shall be limited to the proportion of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense that is equal to the proportion that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares sold by such holder under such registration statement bears to the total net proceeds from the sale of all securities sold thereunder, but not in any event to exceed the net proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement. (c) in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties. the indemnifying party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. such firm shall be designated in writing by the holders, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, and by the company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than thirty days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party promptly following of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 6.10, except to the extent that the failure so to deliver the notice is prejudicial to the indemnifying party's ability to defend such action. (d) if the indemnification provided for in section 6.10(a) and/or (b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 6.10(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 6.10, no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of net proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the remedies provided for in this section 6.10 are not exclusive and shall not limit any right or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. section 6.11. lock-up in connection with a registration of securities. each holder shall, in connection with any registration of the company's securities, upon the request of the company or the underwriters managing any underwritten offering of such securities, agree in writing not to effect any sale, disposition or distribution of any registrable securities (other than that included in the registration) without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter for such reasonable and customary period of time (not to exceed 120 days) from the effective date of such registration as the company or the underwriters may specify; provided, however, that all executive officers and directors of the company (other than executive officers and directors owning an aggregate of less than 1% of the outstanding common stock as of the effective date of such registration statement) shall also have agreed not to effect any sale, disposition or distribution of any registrable securities under the circumstances and pursuant to the terms set forth in this section 6.11. in order to enforce the foregoing covenant in this section 6.11, the company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the registrable securities of each holder (and the shares or securities of every other person subject to the foregoing restriction), which stop-transfer instructions shall only be effective until the end of such reasonable and customary period. section 6.12. transfer of registration rights. the registration rights of any holder under this agreement with respect to the registrable securities may be transferred to any transferee of such registrable securities who acquires any registrable securities of any holder; provided that such registration rights may not be transferred to a holder of less than 2.5% of the outstanding common stock unless such transferee is a rakepoll affiliate (or a partner of a rakepoll affiliate); provided, further, that (i) the transferring holder shall give the company written notice at or prior to the time of such transfer stating the name and address of the transferee and identifying the securities with respect to which the rights under this agreement are being transferred, (ii) such transferee shall agree in writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company, to be bound as a holder by the provisions of this article vi, and (iii) immediately following such transfer the further disposition of such securities by such transferee is restricted under the securities act. section 6.13. selection of counsel. in connection with any registration of registrable securities pursuant to sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 hereof, the holders of a majority of the registrable securities covered by any such registration may select one counsel to represent all holders of registrable securities covered by such registration; provided, however, that in the event that the counsel selected as provided above is also acting as counsel to the company in connection with such registration, the remaining holders shall be entitled to select one additional counsel to represent all such remaining holders. article vii representations and warranties section 7.1. representations of the company. as of the date hereof and as of the closing date the company represents and warrants as follows: (a) authority relative to this agreement. the company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (the "transactions"). the execution and delivery of this agreement by the company and the consummation by the company of the transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the company are necessary to authorize this agreement or to consummate the transactions. this agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by rakepoll, constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the company.

(b) the corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the series i participating preferred stock as provided in paragraph (a) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the common stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the common stock during the period between any quarterly dividend payment date and the next subsequent quarterly dividend payment date, a dividend of $100 per share on the series i participating preferred stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent quarterly dividend payment date. (c) dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of series i participating preferred stock from the quarterly dividend payment date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of series i par- ticipating preferred stock unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first quarterly dividend payment date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a quarterly dividend payment date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of series i participating preferred stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such quarterly dividend payment date in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such quarterly dividend payment date. accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. dividends paid on the shares of series i participating preferred stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by- share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. the board of directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of series i participating preferred stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. 3. voting rights. the holders of shares of series i participating preferred stock shall have the following voting rights: (a) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of series i participating preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the corporation. in the event the corporation shall at any time after the rights declaration date (i) declare any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding common stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, by reclassification or otherwise, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of series i participating preferred stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such event. (b) except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of series i participating preferred stock and the holders of shares of common stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the corporation. (c) (i) if at any time dividends on any series i participating preferred stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "default period") which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of series i participating preferred stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. during each default period, all holders of preferred stock (including holders of the series i participating preferred stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two directors. (ii) during any default period, such voting right of the holders of series i participating preferred stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this section 3(c) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the holders of any other series of preferred stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the authorized number of directors shall be exercised unless the holders of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of preferred stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. the absence of a quorum of the holders of common stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of preferred stock of such voting right. at any meeting at which the holders of preferred stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the board of directors as may then exist up to two directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two directors. if the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the preferred stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. after the holders of the preferred stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of preferred stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the series i participating preferred stock. (iii) unless the holders of preferred stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the board of directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of preferred stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of preferred stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the president, a vice president or the secretary of the corporation. notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of preferred stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph (c)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record preferred stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as the same appears on the books of the corporation. such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 10 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of preferred stock outstanding. notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (c)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders. (iv) in any default period, the holders of common stock, and other classes of stock of the corporation, if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of directors until the holders of preferred stock shall have exercised their right to elect two directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders of preferred stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the board of direc- tors may (except as provided in paragraph (c)(ii) of this section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. references in this paragraph (c) to directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence. (v) immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of preferred stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y) the term of any directors elected by the holders of preferred stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in, or pursuant to, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c)(ii) of this section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws). any vacancies in the board of directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum. (d) except as set forth herein, holders of series i participating preferred stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of common stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. 4. certain restrictions. (a) whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the series i participating preferred stock as provided in section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of series i participating preferred stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the corporation shall not (i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the series i participating preferred stock; (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liqui- dation, dissolution or winding up) with the series i participating preferred stock except dividends paid ratably on the series i participating preferred stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the series i participating preferred stock provided that the corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the series i participating preferred stock; or (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of series i participating preferred stock or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the series i participating preferred stock except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the board of directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the board of directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes. (b) the corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the corporation unless the corporation could, under paragraph (a) of this sec- tion 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner. 5. reacquired shares. any shares of series i participating preferred stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. all such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of preferred stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the board of directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein. 6. liquidation, dissolution or winding up. (a) upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the series i participating preferred stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of series i participating preferred stock shall have received per share, the greater of 1000 times $1.00 or 1000 times the payment made per share of common stock, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "series i liquidation preference"). following the payment of the full amount of the series i liquidation preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of series i participating preferred stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of common stock shall have received an amount per share (the "common adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the series i liquidation preference by (ii) 1000 (as appropri- ately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (c) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalization with respect to the common stock) (such number in clause (ii), the "adjustment number"). following the payment of the full amount of the series i liquidation preference and the common adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of series i participating preferred stock and common stock, respectively, holders of series i participating preferred stock and holders of shares of common stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the adjustment number to 1 with respect to such preferred stock and common stock, on a per share basis, respectively. (b) in the event there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the series i liquidation preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the series i participating preferred stock then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. in the event there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the common adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of common stock. (c) in the event the corporation shall at any time after the rights declaration date (i) declare any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding common stock, or (iii) com- bine the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, by reclassification or otherwise, then in each such case the adjustment number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such adjustment number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 7. consolidation, merger, etc. in case the corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of common stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of series i participating preferred stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of common stock is changed or exchanged. in the event the corporation shall at any time after the rights declaration date (i) declare any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding common stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of series i participating preferred stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to such event. 8. redemption. the shares of series i participating preferred stock shall not be redeemable. 9. ranking. the series i participating preferred stock shall rank junior to all other series of the corporation's preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise. 10. amendment. the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the corporation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the series i participating preferred stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of series i participating preferred stock voting separately as a class. 11. fractional shares. series i participating preferred stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive divi- dends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of series i participating preferred stock. c. $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock. 1. designation and amount. of the five million (5,000,000) shares of preferred stock, one million eight hundred forty thousand (1,840,000) shares shall be designated as "$3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock," $.01 par value per share. 2. definitions. for purposes of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock and this section c, in addition to those terms otherwise defined in this restated certificate of incorporation, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: "board of directors" shall mean the board of directors of the corporation or any committee authorized by such board of directors to perform any of its responsibilities with respect to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock.

(a) in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the corporation (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of common stock or any other series or class of stock of the corporation ranking junior to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of the shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall be entitled to receive $50.00 per share plus an amount per share equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. no payment on account of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation shall be made to the holders of any class or series of stock ranking on a parity with the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock in respect of the distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up unless there shall likewise be paid at the same time to the holders of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock like proportionate amounts determined ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which the holders of all outstanding shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock and the holders of all outstanding shares of such parity stock are respectively entitled with respect to such distribution. if, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the assets of the corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the shares of, $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other shares of stock ranking, as to liquidation, dissolution or winding up, on a parity with the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock and any such other stock ratably in accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable on such shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock and any such other stock if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. for the purposes of this section c4, (i) a consolidation or merger of the corporation with one or more corporations or other entities, (ii) a sale, lease, exchange or transfer of all or any part of the corporation's assets or (iii) a statutory share exchange shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary. (b) subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series or class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, as provided in this section c4, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall not be entitled to share therein. (c) written notice of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, stating the payment date or dates when and the place or places where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than thirty (30) days prior to any payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the transfer agent. 5. redemption at the option of the corporation. (a) $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock may not be redeemed by the corporation prior to march 6, 1996, on or after which the corporation, at its option, may redeem the shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, in whole or in part, out of funds legally available therefor, at any time or from time to time, subject to the notice provisions and provisions for partial redemption described below, during the period beginning on march 1, of the years shown below (march 6 in the case of 1996), at the following redemption prices per share plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to (and including) the date fixed for redemption, whether or not earned or declared: year price ---- ----- 1996 $52.50 1997 $52.08 1998 $51.67 1999 $51.25 2000 $50.83 2001 $50.42 2002 and thereafter $50.00 notwithstanding the foregoing, the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock may not be redeemed prior to march 6, 1998 unless the closing price of the common stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then effective conversion price per share for any 20 trading dates during a period of 30 consecutive trading dates ending within 15 days prior to the mailing of a corporation notice of redemption. (b) in the event the corporation shall redeem shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, a corporation notice of such redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed, at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock records of the corporation. each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock; (vi) the then current conversion price and the date on which the right to convert such shares of 3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock will expire; (vii) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue following such redemption date; (viii) that such redemption is at the option of the corporation; and (ix) that dividends accrued to and including the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice. notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after the redemption date, unless the corporation shall be in default in providing money for the payment of the redemption price (including any accrued and unpaid dividends to (and including) the date fixed for redemption) (x) dividends on the shares of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, (y) said shares shall be deemed no longer outstanding, and (z) all rights of the holders thereof as stockholder of the corporation (except the right to receive from the corporation the money payable upon redemption without interest thereon) shall cease. the corporation's obligation to provide moneys in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the redemption date, the corporation shall deposit with a bank or trust company having an office or agency in the borough of manhattan, city of new york, and having a capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, the principal amount of funds necessary for such redemption, in trust for the account of the holders of the shares to be redeemed (and so as to be and continue to be available therefor), with irrevocable instructions and authority to such bank or trust company that such funds be applied to the redemption of the shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock so called for redemption. any interest accrued on such funds shall be paid to the corporation from time to time. any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from such redemption date shall be released or repaid to the corporation, after which, subject to any applicable laws relating to escheat or unclaimed property, the holder or holders of such shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock so called for redemption shall look only to the corporation for payment of the redemption price. upon surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any such shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the board of directors shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the corporation at the applicable redemption price aforesaid. if fewer than all the outstanding shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock are to be redeemed, shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the corporation from outstanding shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock not previously called for redemption by lot or pro rata (as near as may be) or by any other equitable method determined by the corporation in its sole discretion. if fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation notice of redemption has been given pursuant to this section c5 and any holder of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall, prior to the close of business on the third business day preceding the redemption date, give written notice to the corporation pursuant to section c7(b) of this article hereof of the conversion of any or all of the shares to be redeemed held by such holder (accompanied by a certificate or certificates for such shares, duly endorsed or assigned to the corporation), then the conversion of such shares to be redeemed shall become effective as provided in section c7 of this article. 6. shares to be retired. any shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock converted, redeemed or otherwise acquired by the corporation shall be retired and cancelled and shall upon cancellation be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, subject to reissuance by the board of directors as $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock or as shares of preferred stock of one or more other series. 7. conversion. holders of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall have the right to convert all or a portion of such shares (including fractions of such shares) into shares of common stock, as follows: (a) subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this section c7, a holder of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall have the right, at his or her option, at any time, to convert any of such shares (or fractions thereof) into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/100th of a share) obtained by dividing the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares to be converted by the conversion price and by surrender of such shares, such surrender to be made in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section c7; provided, however, that the right to convert shares called for redemption pursuant to section c5 of this article shall terminate at the close of business on the third business day preceding the date fixed for such redemption, unless the corporation shall default in making payment of the amount payable upon such redemption. subject to the following provisions of this section c7(a), any shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock may be converted, at the option of its holder, in part into common stock under the procedures set forth above. if a part of a share of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock is converted, then the corporation will convert such share into the appropriate number of shares of common stock (subject to paragraph (c) of this section c7) and issue a fractional shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock evidencing the remaining interest of such holder. (b) in order to exercise the conversion right, the holder of each share of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock (or fraction thereof) to be converted shall surrender the certificate representing such share, duly endorsed or assigned to the corporation or in blank, at the office or agency of the transfer agent in the borough of manhattan, city of new york or los angeles, california, accompanied by written notice to the corporation that the holder thereof elects to convert the holder's $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock or a specified portion thereof. unless the shares issuance on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the name in which such share of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock is registered, each share surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the corporation, duly executed by the holder or such holder's duly authorized attorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax (or evidence reasonably satisfactory to the corporation demonstrating that such taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid). holders of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock at the close of business on a dividend payment record date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date notwithstanding the conversion thereof or the corporation's default on payment of the dividend due on such dividend payment date. however, shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any dividend payment record date to the opening of business on the corresponding dividend payment date (except shares called for redemption on a redemption date during such period) must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the dividend payable on such shares on such dividend payment date. a holder of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock on a dividend payment record date who (or whose transferee) converts shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock on a dividend payment date will receive the dividend payable on such shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock by the corporation on such date, and the converting holder need not include payment in the amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion. except as provided above, no payment or adjustment will be made on account of accrued or unpaid dividends upon conversion of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock. as promptly as practicable after the surrender of certificates for shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock as aforesaid, the corporation shall issue and shall deliver at such office to such holder, or on his or her written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares in accordance with the provisions of this section c7, and any fractional interest in respect of a share of common stock arising upon such conversion shall be settled as provided in paragraph (c) of this section c7. each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the certificates for shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall have been surrendered and such notice received by the corporation as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate of certificates for shares of common stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares represented thereby at such time on such date and such conversion shall be at the conversion price in effect at such time as such date, unless the stock transfer books of the corporation shall be closed on that date, in which event such person or persons shall be deemed to have become such holder or holders of record at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the conversion price in effect on the date upon which such shares shall have been surrendered and such notice received by the corporation. all shares of common stock delivered upon conversion of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock will, upon delivery, be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable. (c) in connection with the conversion of any shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, fractions of such shares may be converted; however, no fractional shares or securities representing fractions of shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock. instead of any fractional interest in a share of common stock which would otherwise be delivered upon the conversion of a shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock (or fractions thereof), the corporation shall pay to the holder of such shares an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the current market price of common stock on the trading date immediately preceding the date of conversion multiplied by the fraction of a share of common stock represented by such fractional interest. if more than one share (or fraction thereof) shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock so surrendered. (d) the conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows: (i) stock dividends and stock splits. if at any time after the issue date, (a) the corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of any dividend payable in shares of common stock or (b) the number of shares of common stock shall have been increased by a subdivision or split-up of shares of common stock, then, on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive such dividend or immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or split-up, as the case may be, the number of shares to be delivered upon surrender of any share of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion will be appropriately increased so that each holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock thereafter will be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock that such holder would have owned immediately following such action had such share been surrendered for conversion immediately prior thereto, and the conversion price will be appropriately adjusted. the time of occurrence of an event giving rise to an adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (d)(i) shall, in the case of subdivision or split-up, be the effective date thereof and shall, in the case of a stock dividend, be the record date thereof. (ii) combination of stock. if the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any time after the issue date shall have been decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of common stock, then, immediately after the effective date of such combination, the number of shares to be delivered upon surrender of any shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion will be appropriately decreased so that each holder thereafter will be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock that such holder would have owned immediately following such action had such shares been surrendered for conversion immediately prior thereto, and the conversion price will be appropriately adjusted. (iii) reorganization. if any capital reorganization of the corporation, or any reclassification of the common stock, or any consolidation of the corporation with or merger of the corporation with or into any other corporation or any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation to any other person (including any individual, partnership, joint venture, corporation, trust or group thereof) shall be effected in such a way that the common stock shall be converted into the right to receive stock, securities or other property (including cash or any combination thereof), then, upon surrender of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion in accordance with the term of this section c7, each holder shall have the right to receive the kind and holder shall have the right to receive the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable (including cash or any combination thereof) upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, lease or other transfer by a holder of the number of shares of common stock that such holder of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock would have been entitled to receive upon surrender of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion pursuant to this section c7 had the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock been surrendered for conversion immediately prior to such merger or sale, lease or other transfer. (iv) special dividends. if (other than in a dissolution or liquidation) securities of the corporation (other than shares of common stock or rights, options or warrants referred to in subparagraph (v) hereof) or evidence of its indebtedness or assets (other than cash dividends payable (a) out of retained earnings or (b) out of any earnings or surplus not in excess of 10% of the average closing price of the common stock for the thirty (30) trading days prior to the fifth trading day before the date of declaration multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding during such period), are issued by way of a dividend on outstanding shares of common stock, then the number of shares to be delivered upon surrender of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall be appropriately increased so that immediately after the date fixed by the corporation as the record date in respect of such issuance, each holder will be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares such holder would have been entitled to receive immediately before the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such dividend by a fraction, the denominator of which shall be the closing price of the common stock on such record date less the then fair market value as determined by the board of directors, whose determination if made in good faith shall be conclusive, of the portion of the securities or evidence of indebtedness or assets distributed applicable to one share of common stock and the numerator of which shall be such closing price; and the conversion price shall be appropriately adjusted. such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such record date. (v) rights offering. if the corporation at any time after the issue date shall issue or sell or fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase or otherwise acquire common stock (of securities convertible or exchangeable for common stock), in any such case, at a price per share (or having a conversion price or exchange value per share) that, together with the value (if for consideration other than cash, as determined in good faith by the board of directors) of any consideration paid for any such rights, options or warrants is less than the closing price of the common stock on the date of such issuance or sale or on such record date then, immediately after such record date, the number of shares to be delivered upon surrender of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion shall be appropriately increased so that each holder thereafter will be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares such holder would have been entitled to receive immediately before the date of such issuance or sale on such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date plus the number of additional shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so offered are initially convertible) and the denominator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date plus the number of shares of common stock that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such closing price, and the conversion price shall be appropriately adjusted. notwithstanding the foregoing, rights issued by the corporation to all holders of its common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase securities of the corporation, which rights (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock, (ii) are not exercisable, and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common stock pursuant to the corporation's rights agreement, dated as of march 16, 1992, between the corporation and first interstate bank, ltd. (the "rights plan") or any future or successor plan substantially similar to the rights plan, in each case in clauses (i) through (iii) until the occurrence of a specified event or events, shall for purposes of this paragraph (d) of this section c7 not be deemed issued until the occurrence of the earliest such specified event. (vi) no adjustments to exercise price. no adjustment in the conversion price in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above need be made if such adjustment would amount to a change in such conversion price of less than $.05; provided, however, that the amount by which any adjustment is not made by reason of the provisions of this section shall be carried forward and taken into account at the time of any subsequent adjustment in the conversion price; and provided further, that adjustment shall be required and made in accordance with the provisions of this section c7 not later than such time as may be required in order to preserve the tax free nature of a distribution to the holder of any share of common stock. anything in this section c7 to the contrary notwithstanding, the corporation shall be entitled to the extent permitted by law to make such reductions in the conversion price, in addition to those required by this section c7, as it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holder of common stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of capital stock or rights or warrants to purchase capital stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes of for any other reasons. (vii) readjustments, etc. if an adjustment is made under paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above, and the event to which the adjustment relates does not occur, then any adjustment in the conversion price or shares of common stock to be delivered upon surrender of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion that were made in accordance with such paragraphs shall be adjusted back to the conversion price and the number of shares of common stock to be delivered upon surrender of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion that were in effect immediately prior to the record date for such event. (e) whenever the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided, the corporation shall promptly file in the custody of its secretary or an assistant secretary at its principal office and with the transfer agent an officers' certificate setting forth the adjusted number of shares of common stock to be delivered upon surrender of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for conversion and the conversion price after such adjustment, the method of calculating thereof and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustments are based. promptly after each such adjustment, the corporation shall cause a copy of such certificate to be mailed to the holder of each share of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock at his or her last address as shown on the stock books of the corporation. each such officers' certificate shall be made available at all reasonable times for inspection by each holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock. (f) in any case in which paragraph (d) of this section c7 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event and the date fixed for conversion pursuant to section c7 occurs after such record date but before the occurrence of such event, the corporation may defer until the actual occurrence of such event (a) issuing to the holder of any share of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock surrendered for conversion the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the common stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (b) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section c7. (g) the corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock or its issued shares of common stock held in its treasury, or both, sufficient shares of common stock to provide for conversion of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock from time to time as such; $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock is presented for conversion. before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the conversion price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, the corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the corporation may validly and legally issue shares of common stock at such adjusted conversion price which shares shall be fully-paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. prior to the delivery of any securities which the corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, the corporation will endeavor in good faith and as expeditiously as possible to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any governmental authority. (h) the corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of the shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock (or any other securities issued on account of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock pursuant hereto) or shares pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock (or any other securities issued on account of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock pursuant hereto) or shares of common stock in a name other than the name in which the shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock with respect to which such shares of common stock are issued were registered and the corporation shall not be required to make any issue or delivery unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the reasonable satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid or is not required to be paid. (i) if: (i) the corporation shall authorize the issuance to all holders of the common stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or any other subscription rights or warrants; or (ii) the corporation shall authorize the distribution to all holders of the common stock of evidences of its indebtedness or assets (other than cash dividends payable out of retained earnings, distributions excluded from the operation of subparagraph (d)(iv) of this section c7, stock dividends or securities issued pursuant to any stockholder rights plan or any similar plan of the corporation); or (iii) there shall be any capital reorganization or reclassification of the common stock (other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding common stock, an increase in the authorized capital stock of the corporation not involving the issuance of any shares thereof, or a change in par value of the common stock), or any other consolidation or merger to which the corporation is a party (other than a consolidation or merger with a subsidiary in which the corporation is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or change in the common stock outstanding) or a sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation; or (iv) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the corporation; or (v) there shall be any other event that would result in an adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section c7 of the conversion price or the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased upon the conversion of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock; then the corporation will cause to be filed with the transfer agent and to be mailed to each holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock by first class mail addressed to such holder at the address appearing in the stock records of the corporation, at least twenty (20) days (or ten (10) days in any case specified in clauses (i) or (ii) above) before the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (a) the date as of which the holders of common stock of record entitled to receive any such rights, warrants or distributions are to be determined or (b) the date on which any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of common stock of record will be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for securities or other property, if any, deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. such notice shall also state whether such transaction will result in any adjustment in the conversion price and, if so, shall state what the adjusted conversion price will be and when it will become effective. the failure to give such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any distribution right, warrant, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up or the vote upon any such action. 8. redemption at option of holder upon a fundamental change. (a) if a fundamental change (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section c8) occurs, each holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall have the right, at the holder's option, to require the corporation to repurchase all of such holder's $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, or any portion thereof that has an aggregate liquidation value that is a multiple of $50.00, on the date (the "repurchase date") selected by the corporation that is not less than 10 nor more than 20 days after the final surrender date (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section c8), a price per share equal to $50.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the repurchase date. the corporation may, at its option, pay all or any portion of the repurchase price upon a fundamental change in shares of common stock of the corporation or any successor corporation. for purposes of calculating the number of shares of common stock issuable upon such redemption, the value of any closing prices of such common stock for the five trading dates ending on the third trading date immediately preceding the repurchase date. payment may not be made in shares of common stock unless such shares (i) have been, or will be registered on or prior to the final surrender date (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section c8 under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or are freely tradable pursuant to an exemption thereunder and (ii) are listed on a united states national securities exchange or quoted on the nasdaq national market at the time of payment. (b) within 30 days after the occurrence of a fundamental change, the corporation must mail to all holders of record of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock a corporation notice containing the information set out in paragraph (b) of section c5, of this article, except that, for purposes of this section c8 only, instead of stating that such redemption is at the option of the corporation, the corporation notice shall describe the occurrence of such fundamental change and of the repurchase right arising as a result thereof. the corporation must cause a copy of such notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the borough of manhattan, the city of new york. at least two business days prior to the repurchase date, the corporation must publish a similar notice stating whether and to what extent the repurchase price will be paid in cash or shares of common stock. to exercise the repurchase right, a holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock must surrender, on or before the date which is, subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, 60 days after the date of mailing of the corporation notice (the "final surrender date"), the certificates representing the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock with respect to which the right is being exercised, duly endorsed for transfer to the corporation, together with a written notice of election. (c) the term "fundamental change" shall mean any of the following: (i) a "person" or "group" (within the meaning of sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")) becoming, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, the "beneficial owner" (as defined in rule 13d-2 under the exchange act) of voting shares (as defined in this paragraph (c)) of the corporation entitled to exercise more than 60% of the total voting power of all outstanding voting shares of the corporation (including any voting shares that are not then outstanding of which such person or group is deemed the beneficial owner); or (ii) any consolidation of the corporation with, or merger of the corporation into, any other person, any merger of another person into the corporation, or any sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation to another person (other than a merger, (a) which results in the holders of common stock of the corporation immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction owning shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation in such transaction representing in excess of 40% of the total voting power of all shares of capital stock of such surviving corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors and (b) in which the shares of the surviving corporation held by such holders are, or immediately upon issuance will be, listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the nasdaq national market and are not subject to any right of repurchase by the issuer thereof or any third party and are not otherwise subject to any encumbrance as a result of such transaction, provided, that the surviving corporation amends its charter or certificate of incorporation to include the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock and its terms as set forth herein); provided, however, that a fundamental change shall not occur if either (i) for any five trading dates during the 10 trading dates immediately preceding either the public announcement by the corporation of such transaction or the consummation of such transaction, the closing price of the common stock is at least equal to 105% of the conversion price in effect on such trading days or (ii) at least 90% of the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares) in such transaction or transactions to the holders of common stock consists of shares of common stock that are, or immediately upon issuance will be, listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the nasdaq national market, and as a result of such transaction or transactions, the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock becomes convertible into such common stock. (d) an election by a holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock to have the corporation redeem shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock pursuant to subsection c8(a) shall become irrevocable at the close of business on the relevant redemption date. (e) the corporation agrees that it will not complete any fundamental change described in subsection c8(c) unless proper provision has been made to satisfy its obligations under this section c8. for purposes of this section c8, "voting shares" is defined to mean all outstanding shares of any class or classes (however designated) of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of members of the board of directors. 9. ranking. any class or classes of stock of the corporation shall be deemed to rank: (i) prior to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, as to dividends or as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if the holders of such class shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock. (ii) on a parity with the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, as to dividends or as to distribution as assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, if the holders of such class of stock and the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid dividends per share or liquidation prices, without preference or priority of one over the other; and (iii) junior to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, as to dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if such stock shall be common stock or if the holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such stock. 10. voting. (a) except as herein provided or as otherwise from time to time required by law, holders of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall have no voting rights. whenever, at any times or times, dividends payable on the shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock at the time outstanding shall be cumulatively in arrears for such number of dividend periods (whether or not consecutive) which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall have the exclusive right, voting separately as a class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock and any such other preferred stock, collectively for purposes of this section c10, the "defaulted preferred stock"), to elect two directors of the corporation at the corporation's next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if such voting rights shall become vested more than 90 days or less than 20 days before the date prescribed for the annual meeting of stockholders, thereupon the holders of the shares of defaulted preferred stock shall be entitled to exercise their voting rights at a special meeting of the holders of shares of defaulted preferred stock as set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section c10. at elections for such directors, each holder of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of defaulted preferred stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of stock held as may be granted to them). upon the vesting of such right of the holders of defaulted preferred stock, the maximum authorized number of members of the board of directors shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of outstanding defaulted preferred stock as hereinafter set forth. the right of holders of defaulted preferred stock, voting separately as a class, to elect members of the board of directors as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on defaulted preferred stock shall have been paid or declared and funds set aside for payment in full, at which time such right shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned. (b) whenever such voting right shall have vested, such right may be exercised initially either at a special meeting of the holders of shares of defaulted preferred stock called as hereinafter provided, or at any annual meeting of stockholders held for the purpose of electing directors, and thereafter at such meeting or by the written consent of such holders pursuant to section 228 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware. (c) at any time when such voting right shall have vested in the holders of shares of defaulted preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, and if such right shall not already have been initially exercised, an officer of the corporation shall, upon the written request of 10% of the holders of record of shares of such defaulted preferred stock than outstanding, addressed to the secretary of the corporation, call a special meeting of holders of shares of such defaulted preferred stock. such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date upon the notice required for annual meetings of stockholders at the place for holding annual meetings of stockholders of the corporation or, if none, at a place designated by the treasurer of the corporation. if such meeting shall not be called by the proper officers of the corporation within 30 days after the personal service of such written request upon the treasurer of the corporation, or within 30 days after mailing the same within the united states, by registered mail, addressed to the secretary of the corporation at its principal office (such mailing to be evidenced by the registry receipt issued by the postal authorities), then the holders of record of 10% of the shares of defaulted preferred stock then outstanding may designate in writing any person to call such meeting at the expense of the corporation, and such meeting may be called by such person so designated upon the notice required for annual meetings of stockholders and shall be held at the same place as is elsewhere provided in this paragraph. any holder of shares of defaulted preferred stock than outstanding that would be entitled to vote at such meeting shall have access to the stock books of the corporation for the purpose of causing a meeting of stockholders to be called pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, however, no such special meeting shall be called or held during a period within 45 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders. (d) the directors elected pursuant to this section shall serve until the next annual meeting or until their respective successors shall be elected and shall qualify; any director elected by the holders of defaulted preferred stock may be removed by, and shall not be removed otherwise than by, the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the defaulted preferred stock who were entitled to participate in such election of directors, voting as a separate class, at a meeting called for such purpose or by written consent as permitted by law, this restated certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the corporation. if the office of any director elected by the holders of defaulted preferred stock, voting as a class, becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by the holders of defaulted preferred stock, voting as a class, may choose a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. upon any termination of the right of the holders of defaulted preferred stock to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by the holders of defaulted preferred stock, voting as a class, shall terminate immediately. whenever the terms of office of the directors elected by the holders of defaulted preferred stock, voting as a class, shall so terminate and the special voting powers vested in the holders of defaulted preferred stock shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this section c10. (e) so long as any shares of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock outstanding at the time given in person or by proxy either in writing (as permitted by law, this restated certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the corporation) or at any special or annual meeting, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one or more of the following: (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up; (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of this restated certificate of incorporation of the corporation which would adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance of other series of preferred stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of such series or of any other series of preferred stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to adversely affect such rights, preferences or voting powers; or (iii) the authorization of any reclassification of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock. 11. exchange. (a) the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall be exchangeable in whole, but not in part, at the option of the corporation on any dividend payment date beginning march 1, 1994, for the debentures. holders of outstanding shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock will be entitled to receive $50.00 principal amount of debentures in exchange for each share of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock held by them at the time of exchange; provided that the debentures will be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. if the exchange results in an amount of debentures that is not an integral multiple of $1,000, the amount in excess of the closest integral multiple of $1,000 will be paid in cash by the corporation. (b) the corporation will mail to each record holder of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock written notice of its intention to exchange the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for the debentures no less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date of the exchange (the "exchange date"). the notice shall specify the effective date of the exchange and the place where certificates for shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock are to be surrendered for debentures and shall state that dividends on $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock will cease to accrue on the exchange date. prior to giving notice of intention to exchange, the corporation shall have executed and delivered to a bank or trust company selected by the corporation to act as trustee with respect to the debentures, which trustee shall meet the eligibility requirements of section 310(a) of the trust indenture act of 1939 as then in effect, and which trustee shall have executed and delivered to the corporation, an indenture substantially in the form attached to the placement agreement dated february 19, 1993, between the corporation and alex. brown & sons incorporated, montgomery securities and painewebber incorporated with such changes as may be required by law, stock exchange rule, nasdaq national market rule or customary usage (including, without limitation, such changes as are requested by the trustee with respect to its rights and obligations thereunder, provided that any such changes do not adversely affect the rights of holders of the debentures thereunder). (c) if the corporation has caused the debentures to be authenticated on or prior to the exchange date and has complied with the other provisions of this section c11, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock have not been surrendered for exchange, on the exchange date dividends shall cease to accrue on the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock and at the close of business on the exchange date the holders of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall cease to be stockholders with respect to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock and shall have no interest in or other claims against the corporation by virtue thereof and shall have no voting or other rights with respect to the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, except the right to receive the debentures issuable upon such exchange and the right to accumulated and unpaid dividends, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement, if required by the corporation) of their certificates, and the shares evidenced thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding for any purpose. the corporation will cause the debentures to be authenticated on or before the exchange date. (d) notwithstanding the foregoing, if notice or exchange has been given pursuant to this section c11 and any holder of shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock shall, prior to the close of business on the exchange date, give written notice to the corporation pursu- ant to section c7 of this article of the conversion of any or all of the shares held by the holder (accompanied by a certificate or certificates for such shares, duly endorsed or assigned to the corporation), then the exchange shall not become effective as to the shares to be converted and the conversion shall become effective as provided in such section c7. (e) the debentures will be delivered to the persons entitled thereto upon surrender to the corporation or its agent appointed for that purpose of the certificates for the shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock being exchanged therefor. (f) notwithstanding the other provisions of this section c11, if on the exchange date the corporation has not paid full cumulative dividends on the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock (or set aside a sum therefor) the corporation may not exchange the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for the debentures and any notice previously given pursuant to this section c11 shall be of no effect. (g) prior to the exchange date, the corporation will comply with any applicable securities and blue sky laws with respect to the exchange of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock for the debentures. 12. record holders. the corporation and the transfer agent may deem and treat the record holder of any shares of $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the corporation nor the transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 13. notice. except as may otherwise be provided for herein, all notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and all notices hereunder shall be deemed to have been given upon receipt, in the case of a notice of conversion given to the corporation as contemplated in section c7(b) of this article, or, in all other cases, upon the earlier of receipt of such notice or three business days after the mailing of such notice if sent by registered mail (unless first-class mail shall be specifically permitted for such notice under the terms of this section c of this article) with postage prepaid, addressed: if to the corporation, to its offices at 9360 towne centre drive, san diego, california 92121 (attention: investor relations department) or to an agent of the corporation designated as permitted by this certificate, or, if to any holder of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock, to such holder at the address of such holder of the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock as listed in the stock record books of the corporation (which may include the records of any transfer agent for the $3.75 convertible exchangeable preferred stock); or to such other address as the corporation or holder, as the case may be, shall have designated by notice similarly given. d. common stock. 1. relative rights of preferred stock and common stock. all preferences, voting powers, relative, participating, optional or other special rights and privileges, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the common stock are expressly made subject and subordinate to those that may be fixed with respect to any shares of the preferred stock. 2. voting rights. except as otherwise required by law or this restated certificate of incorporation, each holder of common stock shall have one vote in respect of each share of stock held by such holder of record on the books of the corporation for the election of directors and on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the corporation. 3. dividends. subject to the preferential rights of the preferred stock, the holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the board of directors, out of the assets of the corporation which are by law available therefor, dividends payable either in cash, in property or in shares of capital stock. 4. dissolution, liquidation or winding up. in the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the corporation, after distribution in full of the preferential amounts, if any, to be distributed to the holders of shares of the preferred stock, holders of common stock shall be entitled, unless otherwise provided by law or this restated certificate of incorporation, to receive all of the remaining assets of the corporation of whatever kind available for distribution to stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by them respectively. article v no action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting and the power of stockholders to consent in writing, without a meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically denied. special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the chairman of the board or the president of the corporation or by a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors. article vi except as otherwise provided for in article iv, the board of directors shall be divided into three classes, designated class i, class ii and class iii, as nearly equal in number as possible, and the term of office of directors of one class shall expire at each annual meeting of stockholders, and in all cases as to each director until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify or until his earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. except as otherwise provided for in article iv, additional directorships resulting from an increase in number of directors shall be apportioned among the classes as equally as possible. the initial term of office of directors of class i shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 1993; that of class ii shall expire at the annual meeting in 1994; and that of class iii shall expire at the annual meeting in 1995; and in all cases as to each director until his successor shall be elected and shall

of stockholders after their election. a director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, unless otherwise specified by law or this restated certificate of incorporation. article vii election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the by- laws so provide. article viii whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the state of delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receivers appointed for the corporation under the provisions of section 291 of title 8 of the delaware code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the corporation under the provisions of section 279 of title 8 of the delaware code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or the stockholders or class of stockholders of the corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. if a majority, in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the corporation, as the case may be, and also on the corporation. article ix a. no personal liability. a director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation and its stockholders; (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violations of law; (3) under section 174 of the delaware general corporation law; or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. b. indemnification. each person who is or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, offi- cer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the delaware general corporation law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law per- mitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, erisa excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall incur to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in the second paragraph hereof, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. the right to indemnification conferred in this section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation any expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the delaware general corporation law requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the corpora- tion of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this section or otherwise. the corporation may, by action of its board of directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. if a claim under the first paragraph of this section is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. it shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the delaware general corporation law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the delaware general corporation law, nor an actual determina- tion by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. the right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the restated certificate of incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. the corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the delaware general corporation law. article x the board of directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws of the corporation, provided, however, that any adoption, amendment or repeal of by-laws of the corporation by the board of directors shall require the approval of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any resolution providing for adoption, amendment or repeal is presented to the board). the stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal by- laws of the corporation, provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of this corporation required by law or by this restated certificate of incorporation the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for such adoption, amendment or repeal by the stockholders of any provisions of the by-laws of the corporation. article xi notwithstanding any other provision of this restated certificate of incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of
