(b) if a lender determines that any change in law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such lender&#146;s capital or on the capital of such lender&#146;s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this agreement or the advances made by such lender, to a level below that which such lender or such lender&#146;s holding company could have achieved but for such change in law (taking into consideration such lender&#146;s policies and the policies of such lender&#146;s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time upon written request from a lender, borrower will pay to such lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or such lender&#146;s holding company for any actual losses with respect to such reduction; provided no lender shall be entitled to request such compensation unless it is the general policy or practice of such lender (as determined by such lender) to request compensation for similar amounts from similar borrowers under comparable provisions of similar loan facilities (to the extent such lender has the right to request such compensation thereunder). (c) a certificate of a lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts (and the calculation thereof) necessary to compensate such lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section 2.07 shall be delivered to administrative agent, and the administrative agent shall deliver or cause to be delivered such certificate to borrower. such certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 53 (d) borrower shall not be required to compensate lender pursuant to this section 2.07 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that lender notifies borrower of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of lender&#146;s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then such nine (9) month period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect). (e) notwithstanding the foregoing, if any lender requests compensation under this section 2.07 or borrower must pay increased amounts or any amounts for indemnified taxes pursuant to section 2.08, then the applicable lender will, if requested by borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another lending office for any advance, or portion thereof, affected by the relevant event if, in the judgment of such lender, such designation would (i) avoid the requirement for or reduce the amount of such compensation, increased amounts or amounts for indemnified taxes, and (ii) would not subject such lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such lender; provided that such efforts need only be made on terms that, in the commercially reasonable judgment of such lender, cause such lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; provided further that nothing in this section 2.07(e) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any loan party or the rights of such lender pursuant to section 2.07 through (d) or section 2.08. borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any lender in connection with any such designation. (f) borrower shall compensate each lender, upon written request by such lender (which written request shall be conclusive absent manifest error), for all reasonable loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) actually incurred by it as a result of: (i) any payment or prepayment of a libor advance on a day other than an interest payment date (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or (ii) any failure by borrower to prepay or borrow any libor advance on the date or in the amount notified by borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such lender to make a libor advance in breach of its obligation hereunder). such loss, cost or expense for any lender shall be deemed to be an amount determined by such lender equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such advance had such event not occurred, at the reference interest rate that would have been applicable to such advance, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then-current interest period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the interest period for such advance), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the euro dollar market. (g) the payment of any additional amount or amounts pursuant to this section 2.07, unless otherwise specified hereunder, shall not in and of itself be deemed to be a prepayment of an advance and shall not give rise to a prepayment fee under section 2.04(c). 54 section 2.08 taxes. (a) payments free of taxes . any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any loan party under any margin loan documentation shall be made without deduction or withholding for any taxes, except as required by applicable law. if any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of administrative agent or the relevant loan party, as applicable) requires the deduction or withholding of any tax from any such payment by administrative agent or a loan party, then administrative agent or such loan party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such tax is an indemnified tax, then the sum payable by the applicable loan party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this section 2.08) each lender or agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. (b) payment of other taxes by loan parties . the loan parties shall timely pay to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of administrative agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any other taxes. (c) evidence of payments . as soon as practicable after any payment of taxes by any loan party to a governmental authority pursuant to this section 2.08, such loan party shall deliver to administrative agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such governmental authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to administrative agent. (d) indemnification by loan parties . the loan parties shall indemnify lenders and agents, within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any indemnified taxes (including indemnified taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this section 2.08) payable or paid by lenders or agents or required to be withheld or deducted from any payment to any lender or agent and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (other than indemnified taxes and expenses payable by reason of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the applicable lender or agent), whether or not such indemnified taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority; provided that if the relevant loan party reasonably believe that such taxes were not correctly or legally asserted, such lender or agent, as applicable, will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with such loan party to obtain a refund of such taxes (which shall be repaid to the loan parties in accordance with section 2.08(f)) so long as such efforts would not, in the sole determination of such lender or agent, result in any additional material unreimbursed cost or expense. a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability (setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis and calculation of such amount) delivered to any loan party (with a copy to administrative agent), or by administrative agent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (e) status of lenders . 55 (a) any lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under any margin loan documentation shall deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. in addition, any lender, if reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent as will enable the borrower or the administrative agent to determine whether or not such lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in section 2.08(e)(b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(4) below) shall not be required if in the lender&#146;s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such lender.

(2) any lender that is not a u.s. person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such lender becomes a lender under this agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the borrower or the administrative agent), whichever of the following is applicable: i) in the case of a lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the united states is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any margin loan documentation, executed copies of irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, u.s. federal withholding tax pursuant to the &#147;interest&#148;

within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(a) of the code, a &#147;10 percent shareholder&#148; of the borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(b) of the code, or a &#147;controlled foreign corporation&#148; described in section 881(c)(3)(c) of the code (a &#147; u.s. tax compliance certificate &#148;) and (y) two executed copies of irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e; or iv) to the extent a lender is not the beneficial owner, two executed copies of irs form w-8imy, accompanied by irs form w-8eci, irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e, a u.s. tax compliance certificate substantially in the form of exhibit k-2 or exhibit k-3 , irs form w-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such lender may provide a u.s. tax compliance certificate substantially in the form of exhibit k-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (3) any lender that is not a u.s. person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such lender becomes a lender under this agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the borrower or the administrative agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in u.s. federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the borrower or the administrative agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 57 (4) if a payment made to a lender under any margin loan documentation would be subject to u.s. federal withholding tax imposed by fatca if such lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of fatca (including those contained in section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the code, as applicable), such lender shall deliver to the borrower and the administrative agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by section 1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent as may be necessary for the borrower and the administrative agent to comply with their obligations under fatca and to determine that such lender has complied with such lender&#146;s obligations under fatca or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. solely for purposes of this clause (4), &#147;fatca&#148; shall include any amendments made to fatca after the date of this agreement. each lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the borrower and the administrative agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

(g) indemnification by the lenders . each lender shall severally indemnify the administrative agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any indemnified taxes attributable to such lender (but only to the extent that the loan parties have not already indemnified the administrative agent for such indemnified taxes and without limiting the obligation of the loan parties to do so), (ii) any taxes attributable to such lender&#146;s failure to comply with the provisions of section 10.07(c) relating to the maintenance of a participant register and (iii) any excluded taxes attributable to such lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the administrative agent in connection with any margin loan documentation, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any lender by the administrative agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. each lender hereby authorizes the administrative agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such lender under any margin loan documentation or otherwise payable by the administrative agent to the lender from any other source against any amount due to the administrative agent under this paragraph (g). 58 (h) [reserved]. section 2.09 illegality . notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if any lender shall notify borrower and administrative agent that any law makes it unlawful, or any governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such lender to perform its obligations to make or maintain advances hereunder as libor advances, the obligation of such lender to make such advances shall be terminated and all such advances shall become base rate advances either on the next succeeding interest payment date, if such lender may lawfully continue to maintain the advances to such day, or immediately, if such lender may not lawfully continue to maintain the advances. section 2.10 evidence of debt . (a) each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of borrower to such lender resulting from each advance from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder.

(c) the entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided that the failure of administrative agent or any lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of borrower to repay such obligations in accordance with their terms. (d) no promissory note shall be required to evidence the advances by lenders to borrower. upon the request of a lender, borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such lender a promissory note, payable to such lender and its registered assigns and in a form approved by such lender, which shall evidence the advances to borrower by such lender in addition to such records. thereafter, the advances evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein and its registered assigns. section 2.11 payments and computations . 59 (a) all payments to be made by borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. borrower shall make each payment hereunder not later than 11:00 a.m. on the day when due (subject to section 2.06(c)(i), with respect to any payment made to cure a collateral shortfall) in dollars to administrative agent and in immediately available funds. administrative agent shall promptly distribute to each lender its share, determined on a pro rata basis (or other applicable basis as provided herein), of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such lender. all payments received by administrative agent after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding business day (subject to section 2.06(c)(i), with respect to any payment made to cure a collateral shortfall) and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. (b) whenever any payment hereunder would be due on a day other than a business day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding business day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or any fees, as the case may be. section 2.12 replacement of non-consenting lenders. (a) if any lender is a non-consenting lender, borrower may: (i) at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such lender and the administrative agent, require such lender to assign and delegate, without recourse, in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, section 10.07, all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to section 2.07 or section 2.08) and obligations under this agreement and the related margin loan documentation to a person eligible to take such loans by assignment pursuant to section 10.07 (and such non-consenting lender shall be deemed to have consented to the assignment and delegation of its interests, rights and obligations if it does not execute and deliver any such assignment to the administrative agent within five (5) business days after having received a request therefor); provided that (w) any such assignment pursuant to this clause (i) will not be deemed to be a waiver or release by such lender of its right to any amount payable under sections 2.04(c) and 2.07(f), (x) borrower shall have paid to the administrative agent the assignment fee (if any), (y) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law and (z) the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent; provided, however, that borrower (or such non-consenting lender, as applicable) shall offer each original lender and/or any of its permitted affiliates a right of first refusal to acquire the interests, rights and obligations of such non-consenting lender by assignment ratably in accordance with such applicable lender&#146;s applicable percentage and if any such original lender and/or any of its permitted affiliates does not accept such offer within seven (7) business days, then it shall be deemed to have waived its right of first refusal; provided further that, if an original lender declines such offer, then such declined amounts shall be reoffered to each original lender that accepted such initial offer and each such original lender shall respond within three (3) business days to such reoffer; or 60 (ii) if such original lender and/or any of its permitted affiliates does not accept such offer(s) of first refusal with respect to any assignment of such non-consenting lender&#146;s interests, rights and obligations as set forth in clause (a)(i), terminate and prepay in full such non-consenting lender&#146;s loans and commitments, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any amount due under sections 2.04(c) and 2.07(f) (and all other obligations that are then due and payable or will become due and payable on account of such prepayment); provided that (i) such non-consenting lender is not an accelerating lender and (ii) such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim that borrower, the administrative agent or any other lender may have against such non-consenting lender. (b) a non-consenting lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such lender or otherwise, it ceases to be a non-consenting lender. section 2.13 accelerating lenders . (a) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but subject to clause (b) below), if one or more lenders become accelerating lenders: (i) each accelerating lender, solely for purposes of determining the rights and obligations of such lender vis-&agrave;-vis borrower, shall be deemed to be: (a) the administrative agent and calculation agent hereunder; and (b) the sole lender hereunder for all purposes and, for the avoidance of doubt, no other lender&#146;s consent shall be necessary for any modification of such rights and obligations; and (ii) solely for purposes of determining the rights and obligations of all lenders that are not accelerating lenders among themselves and vis-&agrave;-vis borrower: (a) each accelerating lender shall be deemed to no longer be a lender hereunder and, for the avoidance of doubt, such accelerating lender&#146;s consent shall not be necessary for any modification of such rights and obligations; and (b) if the administrative agent or calculation agent is an accelerating lender, a replacement therefor shall be selected from among the lenders that are not accelerating lenders as if such agent had resigned. (b) notwithstanding the foregoing, following one or more lenders becoming accelerating lenders, no loan party, for the avoidance of doubt, shall make any payments of its obligations or post any collateral or provide any eligible letter of credit except on a pro rata basis (without regard to clause (a) above). for the avoidance of doubt, the application of proceeds received by an applicable lender in respect of an exercise of its remedies under the margin loan documentation shall not be considered a payment by borrower for purposes of this section 2.13(b). 61 section 2.14 administrative agent &#146; s clawback .

provided further that (i) the provisions set forth in article 9 shall not be waived, amended, modified or supplemented, nor any consent granted to any deviation thereto, without the consent of each agent affected thereby and (ii) section 2.07 or section 2.08 shall not be amended or waived in a way that adversely affects any lender without such lender&#146;s consent. notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) borrower may request an extension of (i) the scheduled maturity date with respect to advances and such extension may be agreed to by a lender with respect to its advances without any requirement for an additional vote or consent by the required lenders provided that borrower has made such extension request to all lenders at least two (2) months (but not more than three (3) months) prior to the scheduled maturity date as in effect on the advance date and (ii) other amounts owing to any lender and such extension may be agreed to by a lender with respect to such amounts owing to it without any requirement for a vote of or consent of other lenders and (b) each lender agrees with each other lender and with borrower that no amendment, termination or supplement shall be made to the security agreements, any issuer agreement, any control agreement or the funding account control agreement, and no new margin loan documentation shall be entered into with any lender (subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to section 2.13), unless a substantially identical amendment, termination or supplement is made to each other issuer agreement or each other control agreement, or substantially identical margin loan documentation is entered into with each other lender, as the case may be. 93 notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon the announcement of any category 1 issuer event, calculation agent shall, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, determine whether such category 1 issuer event shall constitute a mandatory prepayment event upon the occurrence of such category 1 issuer event. within two (2) business days following the announcement of such category 1 issuer event, if it determines that such category 1 issuer event shall constitute a mandatory prepayment event upon the occurrence of such category 1 issuer event, calculation agent shall notify each lender and the borrower of its determination. if, within three (3) business days of receiving such notice, required lenders notify calculation agent and borrower that they disagree with such determination and propose to treat such category 1 issuer event as a facility adjustment event, and include in such notice a set of adjustments that required lenders propose to make in respect of such facility adjustment event that comply with the provisions set forth in section 10.18 (which shall apply for this purpose as if the lenders sending such notice were the calculation agent), and a proposed effective time therefor, then borrower will have the right to accept the required lenders&#146; proposal by written notice delivered to calculation agent and lenders within three (3) business days of its receipt of the required lenders&#146; proposal. calculation agent shall notify borrower that such alternative adjustments apply as of such effective time. if borrower does not accept the required lenders&#146; proposal within the aforementioned time period, such category 1 issuer event shall constitute a mandatory prepayment event upon the occurrence of such category 1 issuer event. if borrower does accept the required lenders&#146; proposal within the aforementioned time period, such proposal shall constitute an adjustment and such adjustment pursuant to this paragraph shall be binding on all parties to the margin loan documentation and all such parties shall enter into such documentation required or reasonably requested by administrative agent to reflect such adjustments. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon the occurrence of any facility adjustment event or potential facility adjustment event (subject to the limitations set forth below and in the definition thereof with respect to an issuer change of control), calculation agent may, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, (a) adjust one or more of the terms or provisions of the facility as the calculation agent determines necessary to account for the economic effect of the facility adjustment event or potential facility adjustment event on the facility (unless the calculation agent determines that no such adjustment is necessary), and (b) determine the effective time of the adjustment (and may take into account, among other factors, volatility, correlation, liquidity and free float of the shares or any other collateral and transfer restrictions, in each case, relative to the shares or, if applicable, any other collateral prior to giving effect to the relevant event). 94 within two (2) business days following the occurrence of any facility adjustment event or potential facility adjustment event (which, for the purposes of this paragraph, shall be deemed to include an announcement of a category 1 issuer event unless calculation agent determines that such category 1 issuer event shall constitute a mandatory prepayment event upon the occurrence of such category 1 issuer event), calculation agent shall notify each lender (the &#147; lender adjustment notification &#148;) of the adjustments to the terms or provisions of the facility that it proposes to make in respect thereof, and the proposed effective time therefor. if, within three (3) business days of receiving such notice, required lenders notify calculation agent that they disagree with such proposed adjustments or effective time, and include in such notice an alternative set of adjustments that required lenders propose to make in respect of such facility adjustment event or potential facility adjustment event that comply with the provisions set forth in section 10.18 (which shall apply for this purpose as if the lenders sending such notice were the calculation agent), and a proposed effective time therefor, then calculation agent shall notify borrower that such alternative adjustments apply as of such effective time. calculation agent shall not make any adjustment in respect of a facility adjustment event or potential facility adjustment event prior to the earlier of (i) the fifth business day following the occurrence thereof and (ii) its receipt of notice from required lenders of any alternative adjustments (and a proposed effective time therefor) or that they agree with calculation agent&#146;s proposed adjustments (and the effective time therefor). subject to section 10.18, any such adjustments pursuant to this paragraph shall be binding on all parties to the margin loan documentation and all such parties shall enter into such documentation required or reasonably requested by administrative agent to reflect such adjustments. notwithstanding the foregoing, if a facility adjustment event or potential facility adjustment event has occurred, no adjustment shall be permitted if the calculation agent does not notify the borrower of an adjustment pursuant to this paragraph within five (5) business days following the date of the lender adjustment notification and no facility adjustment event or potential facility adjustment event will be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of the margin loan documentation (other than to the extent relating to a change of control of the issuer pending the grace period end date). notwithstanding the foregoing (and without limitation of the proviso to the definition of &#147;potential facility adjustment event&#148;), upon the occurrence of any facility adjustment event or potential facility adjustment event, the adjustments, if any, in respect thereof pursuant to the two immediately preceding paragraphs will not, solely as a result of such adjustment, directly cause a mandatory prepayment event to have occurred and be continuing immediately after giving effect thereto. section 10.02 notices;

(c) the loan parties and lenders acknowledge and agree that the margin loan documentation collectively are intended to constitute a &#147;securities contract&#148; as such term is defined in section 741(7) of the bankruptcy code and that each delivery, transfer, payment and grant of a security interest made or required to be made hereunder or contemplated hereby or made, required to be made or contemplated in connection herewith is a &#147;transfer&#148; and a &#147;margin payment&#148; or a &#147;settlement payment&#148; within the meaning of section 362(b)(6) and/or (27) and sections 546(e) and/or (j) of the bankruptcy code. in addition, all obligations under or in connection with the margin loan documentation represent obligations in respect of &#147;termination values,&#148; &#147;payment amounts&#148; or &#147;other transfer obligations&#148; within the meaning of sections 362 and 561 of the bankruptcy code. the parties further acknowledge and agree that the margin loan documentation collectively constitutes a &#147;master netting agreement&#148; within the meaning of the bankruptcy code. section 10.04 costs and expenses; indemnification; damage waiver .
