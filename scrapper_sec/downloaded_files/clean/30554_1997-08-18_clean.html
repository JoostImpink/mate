wilmington, de 19898 during the last five years, neither dupont nor, to the best knowledge of dupont, any director or executive officer of dupont has been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misde- meanors) or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding has been or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3 source and amount of funds or other consideration as of the date hereof, dupont contemplates that the funds to be used by it to consummate the purchase of the series a convertible preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "preferred stock"), of pioneer as described in item 6 below shall come from cash on hand and working capital of dupont, although dupont may determine at the time of purchase to finance or refinance the purchase price from other available sources including through borrowings as appropriate. the aggregate purchase price payable by dupont for the pre- ferred stock at the closing (as defined below) is $1,710,236,944. item 4 purpose of transaction as described in item 6 below, pursuant to an investment agreement, dated as of august 6, 1997 (the "investment agreement"), between dupont and pioneer, at the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby (the "closing"), dupont will purchase 164,445.86 shares of preferred stock from pioneer. as described in item 6 below, the investment agreement generally precludes dupont or any entity controlled by it (the "dupont group") from acquiring any pioneer voting securities during the term of the investment agreement, except for certain rights that allow dupont to obtain and maintain a specified equity ownership interest (as discussed in item 6 below). the investment agreement also provides for certain sell down requirements such that dupont's equity ownership level does not exceed a specified level (as discussed in item 6 below). the purpose of dupont's investment in pioneer is to complement the related transactions contemplated by a research alliance agreement and the joint venture formation agreements (each as defined below) by providing dupont with equity participation in pioneer's equity interest in the commercial joint venture established thereby. in accordance with the terms of the investment agreement, at and as of the closing and subject to the terms and conditions of the investment agreement, dupont will be entitled to designate two nominees to pioneer's board of directors; such number of nominees may be increased to three nominees in the event of an increase in the size of pioneer's board of directors and may be reduced to none based on dupont's equity ownership level in pioneer. in connection with the transactions contemplated by the investment agreement, dupont and pioneer entered into joint venture formation agreements and a research alliance agreement contemplating certain transactions more fully described in item 6 below. pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement, pioneer has agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock to dupont to repurchase shares of its common stock by commencing shortly after the closing a dutch auction tender offer (and, thereafter, if necessary, through open market repurchases) with pioneer seeking to repurchase sufficient shares to increase dupont's equity ownership level up to approximately 19.99%. except as set forth above, dupont has no present plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5 interest in securities of the issuer (a) and (b) as of the date hereof, dupont beneficially owns an aggregate of 164,445.86 shares of preferred stock (convertible upon transfer and under certain other circumstances into 16,444,586 shares of common stock) issuable to dupont at the closing subject to the terms and conditions of the investment agreement. such shares represent 100% of the shares of preferred stock anticipated to be outstanding at the closing (convertible upon transfer and under certain other circumstances into approximately 16.67% of the shares of common stock anticipated to be outstanding at the closing (based on the number of shares of common stock stated to be outstanding as of pioneer's quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarterly period ended may 30, 1997 and assuming that the preferred stock to be acquired by dupont was converted in full)). dupont has the sole power to vote and to dispose of the shares of preferred stock (and to vote and dispose of the shares of common stock such preferred stock is convertible into) subject to the terms and conditions of the investment agreement. except as set forth in this item 5, to the best knowledge of dupont, no director or executive officer of dupont beneficially owns any shares of preferred stock or common stock. (c) other than the transactions contemplated by the investment agreement described herein, neither dupont nor, to the best knowledge of dupont, any director or executive officer of dupont, has effected any transactions in preferred stock or common stock during the past 60 days. (d) no person, other than dupont, has the right to receive dividends from the preferred stock (or the common stock such preferred stock is convertible into), and no person other than dupont has the right to receive the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock (or the common stock such preferred stock is convertible into). (e) not applicable. item 6 contracts, arrangement, understanding or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer on august 6, 1997, pioneer and dupont entered into a research alliance agreement (the "research alliance agreement") and a formation agreement and a limited liability company agreement (collectively, the "joint venture formation agreements") which, along with the investment agreement, established a broad research alliance and collaboration between the two companies that includes the formation of a joint venture to exploit business opportunities in quality grain traits and an equity investment by dupont in pioneer. pursuant to the research alliance agreement, pioneer and dupont have agreed to a broad research alliance to collaborate to take advantage of their respective expertise in technology and know-how concerning quality grain traits, agronomic traits, industrial use traits, genomics and enabling technologies for developing seed, grain, grain products, plant materials and other crop improvement products. pursuant to the joint venture formation agreements, the jointly owned commercial joint venture (with each party owning 50%) will create, maximize and capture value for quality traits. the investment agreement provides for the acquisition by dupont of a new series of preferred stock which represent a common equivalent economic ownership interest in pioneer equal to approximately 19.99% of pioneer's outstanding shares of common stock anticipated to be outstanding at the closing before giving effect to the transaction, and approximately 16.67% after giving effect thereto. the investment agreement requires dupont to sell down certain shares such that its equity ownership level does not exceed a specified level (generally 20% subject to reduction in certain instances including following the sale of shares by dupont) and allows dupont to purchase additional shares of common stock in order to maintain its equity ownership level. pioneer has agreed to repurchase certain shares of its common stock with the proceeds of the sale of preferred stock to dupont as described in item 4 above. as more fully specified in the investment agreement, the dupont group has agreed that it will generally not make any proposals seeking a business combination involving pioneer, deposit pioneer voting securities into a voting trust (except as provided in the investment agreement) or make any similar arrangements regarding pioneer voting securities, engage in a proxy contest or solicitation, call a meeting of shareholders or seek shareholder approval of any action or participate in a group with other holders of pioneer voting securities. the investment agreement contains certain restrictions on the transfer of preferred stock held by dupont and grants pioneer a right of first offer or a right of first refusal with respect to certain such transfers. at the closing, dupont and pioneer will enter into a registration rights agreement granting dupont certain registration rights with respect to shares of common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible. the investment agreement grants dupont certain rights to nominate directors to pioneer's board of directors as set forth in item 4 above. dupont has agreed to vote its share of preferred stock for the election of the slate of nominees proposed by pioneer for election to its board of directors (so long as dupont's nominees are included in such slate) and, except for certain matters specified in the investment agreement, dupont is otherwise free to vote such shares as it elects provided that, in certain instances, any votes in excess of dupont's equity ownership percentage at the time of the vote must be voted by dupont pro rate in accordance with the vote of shareholders of pioneer other than the dupont group. upon the occurrence of certain events including the acquisition by a third party of a specified equity interest in pioneer, certain of the restrictions and rights set forth above and in the investment agreement are modified, terminated or become perpetual, and certain additional rights may come into effect including the termination of the joint venture formation agreements (and the purchase or sale of the commercial joint venture established in accordance therewith) and the research alliance agreement. the investment agreement may be terminated following one year's prior written notice deliverable be either party following the 15th anniversary of the date thereof. pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock, the preferred stock is convertible upon sale to a third party (other than a member of the dupont group) and upon certain other circumstances. in certain circumstances following the sixth anniversary of the date of the investment agreement, the preferred stock may convert at the option of dupont into common stock, in which case, dupont has agreed that such shares of common stock will be placed in a voting trust with such shares to be voted in accordance with the provisions specified above and as set forth in the investment agreement. the preceding summary of certain provisions of the investment agreement and the related agreements is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the investment agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto. except as set forth herein, dupont does not, nor to the best knowledge of dupont, does any director or executive officer of dupont, have any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of pioneer, including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any securities of pioneer, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7 material to be filed as exhibits

(e) the investor agrees, to the extent required by iowa law, to cause the investor nominees to comply with the standards for recusal from board meetings applicable to all members of the board. except for any investor nominee who is an independent director or a fully independent director, the investor acknowledges that the investor nominees to the board will not be entitled to receive any compensation as directors. section 5.2. resignation of investor nominees. unless otherwise agreed by the company, (w) at any time that there are three investor nominees serving on the board, the investor shall cause one of the investor nominees then serving on the board to offer his or her resignation from the board immediately upon the number of directors constituting the entire board constituting 15 or fewer, (x) the investor shall cause all of the investor nominees then serving on the board to offer their resignations from the board immediately upon either (i) at any time after the initial top-up period the investor group's total ownership percentage falls below 10% for twelve consecutive months (subject to extension by the number of days equal to the period of time purchases by the investor group would be prohibited by section 6.7(b)(iv) or section 6.7(d)) or (ii) the ownership cap is at any time less than 10%; (y) the investor shall cause investor nominees then serving on the board to offer his or her resignations from the board immediately upon the ownership cap at any time being less than 18%, so that the total number of investor nominees does not exceed 2 at any time thereafter; and (z) the investor shall cause all of the investor nominees then serving on the board to offer their resignations from the board immediately upon the occurrence of a trigger event or a release event; provided, however, that in the event that the investor group's total ownership percentage is less than the 10% amount referred to in clause (x)(i) of this section 5.2 and would not be so but for the issuance of capital stock by the company during, or within one month prior to, the twelve month period referred to in clause (x)(i) of this section 5.2, such twelve month period shall be extended by an additional six months to eighteen consecutive months. to effectuate the resignations provided for in this section 5.2, the investor shall cause each investor nominee to provide the investor with a letter of resignation upon such investor nominee's election to the board which may be used by the investor at any time. section 5.3. committees. the board will not establish an executive committee authorized to exercise the power of the board generally unless the investor is granted representation on such committee proportional to its representation on the board, nor will the board establish or employ committees (unless the investor is granted proportional representation thereon) as a means designed to circumvent or having the effect of circumventing the rights of the investor under this agreement to representation on the board. section 6 additional agreements section 6.1. standstill agreement.

(the "company"), copies of which are on file at the offices of the secretary of the company." section 8.7. no restrictions. for so long as the total ownership percentage of the investor group shall equal 10% or more, in the aggregate, the company will not take or recommend to its shareholders any amendment to the company's articles of incorporation or bylaws which would impose limitations on the legal rights of the investor group as company shareholders (other than those imposed pursuant to this agreement) based upon the size of security holding permitted under this agreement, the business in which a security holder is engaged or other considerations applicable to the investor group and not to security holders generally. section 8.8. amendment to articles of incorporation. so long as the ownership cap is 18% or more, the company will propose, and the board shall recommend for adoption by the shareholders of the company, no later than the first annual meeting of shareholders following the end of the company buy back period (or such earlier time as the total ownership percentage of the investor group shall equal the ownership cap), and no less frequently than each annual meeting thereafter until the reclassification amendment (as hereinafter defined) is adopted, an amendment (the "reclassification amendment") to the articles of incorporation of the company providing for, and only for, (a) the authorization of a new class of common stock (in addition to the common stock) to be designated as the class b common stock and consisting of the same number of authorized shares as the number of authorized shares of series a convertible preferred stock and which class b common stock shall, as to each share, have the identical rights, powers and preferences (including as to dividends, voting rights, liquidation preference, restriction on transfer, adjustment and conversion) as pertains to each share of series a convertible preferred stock and (b) upon the adoption and effectiveness of the reclassification amendment, the automatic reclassification of each outstanding share of series a convertible preferred stock into one validly issued and fully paid share of class b common stock (whereupon, all references to the series a convertible preferred stock in this agreement shall thereafter mean and refer to the corresponding number of shares of class b common stock). in connection with each meeting of the company's shareholders at which the reclassification amendment is submitted for approval of the company's shareholders, the company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the adoption of the reclassification amendment by the shareholders of the company, including soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of the reclassification amendment by the shareholders of the company. if, after the date of the fifth annual meeting of the company's shareholders following the end of the company buy-back period, (x) the reclassification amendment shall not have been approved by the shareholders of the company, and (y) the investor shall have been advised in writing by its regular independent public accounting firm that unless the shares of series a convertible preferred stock owned by the investor group are converted into common stock in accordance with this section 8.8, such firm cannot deliver its opinion that the investor is entitled to account for its investment in the company on the full equity accounting method (including earnings and investments) (other than, in any such case referred to in this clause (y), as a result of the failure of the investor to fully exercise its rights under this agreement, including its rights to acquire voting securities hereunder (but assuming for purposes hereof that the investor owned voting securities equal to the then applicable ownership cap) or to designate investor nominees for election or appointment to the board or to have such board members participate as board members in the management of the business and affairs of the company), then, at the written request of the investor, both parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to seek approval of the commission or its staff that would permit the investor to account (or, if such accounting has theretofore been allowed, to permit the investor to continue to account) for its investment in the company on the full equity accounting method (including earnings and investments) without the conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock owned by the investor into common stock on the terms set forth below. if the commission or its staff shall not have approved such accounting within six months after the investor's written request referred to above, the investor shall have the option (the "optional conversion right"), which shall be exercisable by the investor by delivering written notice to the company within 30 days after the end of such six month period, to convert all of the series a convertible preferred stock owned by the investor group into common stock as set forth in section 6(a)(iii) of the certificate of designation for the series a convertible preferred stock. all common stock issued to the investor group upon exercise of the optional conversion right, together with all other shares of common stock thereafter acquired by the investor pursuant to the agreement, shall immediately upon each acquisition thereof, be deposited by the investor group into a permanent voting trust in accordance with applicable law (the "voting trust") pursuant to a perpetual voting trust agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the company, and, with respect to matters contained therein which are not specifically contemplated hereby, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the investor, and with an independent trust company, commercial bank or other financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the company and the investor designated as voting trustee (the "voting trustee"). pursuant to such voting trust, the aggregate number of votes as the investor group would from time to time have been able to vote if the investor had not exercised the optional conversion right and continued to own the series a convertible preferred stock will be voted by the voting trustee at the direction of the investor consistent with how such votes could have been voted under this agreement if the optional conversion right had not been exercised, and the balance of the votes attributable to all shares of common stock deposited in the voting trust shall be voted by the voting trustee pro rata in accordance with the votes of all shareholders of the company other than the members of the investor group and the other investor affiliates. the voting trust shall provide for the release and delivery to the investor of shares of common stock, free of the restrictions of the voting trust, and the termination of the provisions thereof with respect to shares of common stock, upon transfer of such shares by the investor to unaffiliated parties in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. the parties hereto hereby agree to enter into arrangements to permit the timely tender into a tender or exchange offer of common stock subject to the voting trust in a manner similar to that applied to the series a convertible preferred stock. there shall not be any obligation to deliver any shares of common stock to the voting trust, and the voting trust shall immediately terminate if it has already been established, at such time as all outstanding shares of common stock (or such securities as the common stock has been converted into) has the same votes per share if any, as all other such shares or other securities, without any "time phased" voting. section 8.9. hsr act filings. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the investor group shall be entitled to make any hsr act filing in connection with the investor group's intention to

(ii) use the company's commercially reasonable efforts to keep the relevant registration statement continuously effective, if a demand registration statement, for up to 60 days or until such earlier date as of which all the registrable securities under the demand registration statement shall have been disposed of in the manner described in the registration statement, or such longer period (but in no event longer than 120 days) as in the judgment of counsel for the underwriters a prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of registrable securities by an underwriter or dealer in accordance with plan of distribution included in such demand registration statement. notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any reason the effectiveness of a demand registration statement pursuant to this section 2 is delayed or suspended or filing of the demand registration statement or seeking effectiveness thereof is postponed as permitted by section 2.1(ii), the commencement of the foregoing period shall be extended by the aggregate number of days of such suspension or postponement. 2.3. the company shall be obligated to effect not more than six demand registrations, subject to the provisions of section 4.1. for purposes of the preceding sentence, a demand registration shall not be deemed to have been effected (i) unless a demand registration statement with respect thereto has become effective, (ii) if after such demand registration statement has become effective, such demand registration statement or the related offer, sale or distribution of registrable securities thereunder is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the holder and such interference is not thereafter eliminated, or (iii) if the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure on the part of the holder. if the company shall have complied with its obligations under this agreement, a right to demand a registration pursuant to this section 2 shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon the earlier of (x) the date as of which all of the registrable securities included therein shall have been distributed pursuant to the registration statement, and (y) the date as of which such demand registration shall have been continuously effective for a 60-day period or other period specified in 2.2(ii) following the effectiveness of such demand registration statement, provided no stop order or similar order, or proceedings for such an order, is thereafter entered or initiated. 2.4. a registration pursuant to this section 2 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the commission as shall (i) be selected by the company and be reasonably acceptable to the holder, and (ii) permit the distribution of the registrable securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution specified in the request pursuant to section 2.1(i). 2.5. the holder shall have the right to select the underwriter or underwriters and manager or managers to administer such offering; provided, however, that each person so selected shall be acceptable to the company in its reasonable judgment. 2.6. the company may not include in a demand registration pursuant to section 2.1 shares of common stock for the account of the company or any subsidiary of the company, but may include shares of common stock for the account of any other person or entity who holds shares of common stock; provided, however, that if the underwriters' representative of any offering described in this section 2.6 shall have informed the company in writing that in its opinion the total number of shares of common stock that the holder, and any other persons or entities desiring to participate in such registration intend to include in such offering is such as to materially and adversely affect the success or pricing of such offering, then the company shall include in such demand registration all registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the holder together with up to such additional number of shares of common stock that any other persons or entities entitled to participate in such registration desire to include in such registration and that the underwriters' representative has informed the company may be included in such registration without adversely affecting the success of pricing of such offering; provided that the number of shares of common stock to be offered for the account of all such other persons and entities participating in such registration shall be reduced or limited pro rata in proportion to the respective number of shares of common stock requested to be registered by such persons and entities to the extent necessary to reduce the respective total number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such offering to the number of shares of common stock recommended by such underwriters' representative. section 3. piggyback registration. 3.1. if at any time after the third anniversary of the closing date, the company proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the company for the account of the company or shareholders of the company other than the holder) shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of common stock under the securities act in connection with the public offering solely for cash on form s- 1, s-2 or s-3 (or any replacement or successor forms) as soon as practicable (but in not event less than ten (10) business days prior to the date of filing any related registration statement), the company shall promptly give the holder written notice of such registration (a "piggyback registration"). upon the written request of the holder given within 10 days following the date of such notice, the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be included in such registration statement (a "piggyback registration statement," the shelf registration statement, the demand registration statement and piggyback registration statement are hereinafter called collectively, "registration statements" and, individually, a "registration statement"), and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be registered under the securities act all the registrable securities that the holder shall have requested to be registered. the company shall have the absolute right to withdraw or cease to prepare or file any piggyback registration statement for any offering referred to in this section 3 without any obligation or liability to the holder; provided, that the company shall promptly notify the holder in writing of any such action. 3.2. if the piggyback registration statement relates to an underwritten offering of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of common stock and if the underwriters' representative of such underwritten offering shall inform the company that in its opinion the inclusion in such underwritten distribution of all or a specified number of such registrable securities or of any other shares of common stock requested to be included would materially and adversely effect the success or pricing of such offering or of such distribution by the underwriters, then the company may, upon written notice to the holder, exclude from such underwritten offering (i) in the event the piggyback registration statement relates to an offering for the account of the company, shares of common stock requested to be included by any persons or entities other than the company, pro rata in proportion to the respective number of shares of common stock requested to be included by such persons and entities, to the extent necessary to reduce the respective total number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such offering to the number of shares of common stock recommended by such underwriters' representative and (ii) in the event the piggyback registration statement relates to an offering for the account of any person or entity other than the company, (a) first, shares of common stock requested to be registered for the account of any persons or entities other than the person or entity making the initial request for such registration (the "requesting party"), pro rata in proportion to the respective number of shares of common stock requested to be registered by such other persons and entities to the extent necessary to reduce the respective total number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such offering to the number of shares of common stock recommended by such underwriters' representative, (b) second, to the extent reduction as a result of clause (a) is insufficient, shares of common stock requested to be registered for the account of the company, and (c) third, to the extent reduction as a result of clauses (a) and (b) is insufficient, shares of common stock requested to be registered for the account of the requesting party. the company may decline to file a piggyback registration statement referred to in this section 3.2 after giving notice to the holder, or withdraw such a piggyback registration statement after filing, or otherwise abandon any such proposed underwritten offering; provided that the company shall promptly notify the holder in writing of any such action. 3.3. the holder may not participate in any underwritten offering under section 2.1 or section 3.1 hereof unless it completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, underwriting agreements, and other customary documents required under the customary terms of such underwriting arrangements. in connection with any underwritten offering under section 2.1, 3.1 or 4.1, each of the holder and the company shall be a party to the underwriting agreement with the underwriters and may be required to make certain customary representations and warranties (in the case of the holder only as to the registrable securities being sold by the holder and any permitted group transferee in such underwritten offering and the plan of distribution thereof) and provide certain customary indemnifications for the benefit of the underwriters. 3.4. the holder shall be entitled to have its registrable securities included in an unlimited number of piggyback registrations pursuant to this section 3. section 4. shelf registration. 4.1. upon the occurrence of a shelf registration event, the company shall file with the commission as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the shelf registration event, a shelf registration statement relating to the offer and sale of the registrable securities by the holder and the permitted holder group transferees from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by the holder and set forth in such shelf registration statement and, thereafter, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such shelf registration statement to be declared effective under the securities act as promptly as practicable. if, on the occurrence of a shelf registration event, the company does not qualify to file a shelf registration statement, then the holder shall be entitled to one additional demand registration pursuant to section 3, but at any time thereafter that the company does so qualify, it shall, as promptly as practicable, file a shelf registration statement. 4.2. the company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by the holder and the permitted holder group transferees for a period ending on the date twenty-four months (the "shelf maintenance period") after the occurrence of the shelf registration event (such date to be extended by the aggregate number of days any shelf registration statement shall be subject to a shelf suspension) or such shorter period as shall terminate when all the registrable securities covered by the shelf registration statement have been sold pursuant to the shelf registration statement (but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in section 4(3) of the act and rule 174 thereunder) (such period being the "shelf period"). 4.3. the company shall be entitled to postpone the filing of any shelf registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed pursuant to this section 4 (or delay seeking, or maintaining continued, effectiveness of a shelf registration statement that has been filed) if the board determines in its reasonable good faith judgment, that such shelf registration would materially interfere with, or require premature disclosure of, any material financing, acquisition, reorganization or other material transaction involving the company or any of its subsidiaries and the company gives the holder notice of such determination (a "shelf suspension"); provided, however, that the company shall not have postponed pursuant to this section 4.3, the commencement of the filing of, delay the seeking the effectiveness of, or suspend the use of any shelf registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed pursuant to this section 4, (i) more than 180 days during the shelf maintenance period, (ii) for a period exceeding 180 days on any one occasion during or (iii) sooner than 90 days after the end of any prior shelf suspension and provided, further, that the shelf maintenance period shall be extended by the aggregate number of days of each shelf suspension. in the case of a shelf suspension, the notice required above shall request the holder to suspend any sale or purchase, or offer to sell or purchase the registrable securities, and to suspend any sale or purchase, or offer to sell or purchase the registrable securities, and to suspend use of the prospectus related to the shelf registration in connection with any such sale or purchase or offer to sell or purchase. the company shall immediately notify the holder upon the termination of any shelf suspension, shall amend or supplement the related prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement or omission therein and shall furnish to the holders such numbers of copies of the prospectus as so amended or supplemental as the holder may reasonably request. the holder will advise the company by at least 5 business days' prior written notice if the holder intends to make any sale under the shelf registration statement that would constitute a "distribution" for purposes of regulation m under the securities act. 4.4. the holder shall have the right to effect an underwritten offering covering not fewer than 1,500,000 shares pursuant to a shelf registration (in which case each such underwritten offering shall constitute a demand registration for purposes of section 2.3) and to select the underwriter or underwriters and manager or managers to administer any offering pursuant to a shelf registration; provided, however, that each person so selected shall be acceptable to the company in its reasonable judgment. section 5. registration procedures. whenever required under section 2, section 3 or section 4 to effect the registration of any registrable securities, the company shall, as expeditiously as practicable: 5.1. prepare and file with the commission a registration statement, including all exhibits required by the commission to be filed therewith, with respect to such registrable securities and, subject to section 2.1 and section 4.3, use the company's commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; provided, however, that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, including documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of the registration statement and prior to effectiveness thereof, the company shall furnish to counsel for the holder and underwriters, copies of all such documents in the form substantially as proposed to be filed with the commission at a reasonable time prior to filing for review and comment by such counsel. 5.2. prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the securities act and rules thereunder with respect to the distribution of all securities covered by such registration statement and as may be reasonably requested by the holder or necessary to keep such registration statement effective pursuant to section 2.2(i) and 4.2. if the registration is for an underwritten offering, the company shall amend the registration statement or supplement the prospectus whenever required by the terms of the underwriting agreement. pending such amendment or supplement the holder and all other members of the investor group, upon written notice by the company, shall cease making offers or transfers of registrable securities pursuant to the prior prospectus. in the event that any registrable securities included in a registration statement subject to, or required by, this agreement remain unsold at the end of the period during which the company is obligated to use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, the company may file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement for the purpose of removing such securities from registered status. 5.3. notify the holder and the underwriters' representative and (if requested) confirm such advise in writing, as soon as practicable after notice thereof is received by the company (i) when the registration statement or any amendment thereto has been filed or becomes effective, the prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the prospectus included therein has been filed, and, to furnish the holder and the underwriters with copies thereof, (ii) of any request by the commission for amendments or supplements to the registration statement or the prospectus included therein or for additional information, (iii) if at any time the representations and warranties of the company contemplated by section 3.3 cease to be true and correct, and (iv) of the receipt by the company of any notification with respect to the suspension or qualification of the registrable securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. 5.4. promptly notify the holder and the underwriters' representative, if any, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act when the company becomes aware of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in any registration statement (as then in effect) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the prospectus and any preliminary prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) when such prospectus was delivered not misleading or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such time period to amend or supplement the prospectus in order to comply with the securities act and, in either case as promptly as practicable thereafter, prepare and file with the commission, and furnish without charge to the holder and the underwriters' representative, if any, a supplement or amendment to such prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance. 5.5. if requested by the underwriters' representative or the holder, promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the underwriters' representative and the holder agree should be included therein relating to the plan of distribution with respect to such registrable securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of registrable securities being sold to such underwriters, the purchase price being paid therefor by such underwriters and with respect to any other terms of the underwritten (or best efforts underwritten) offering of registrable securities to be sold in such offering; and make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment. 5.6. cooperate with the holder and the underwriters' representatives to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing registrable securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such registrable securities to be in such denomination and registered in such names as the underwriters' representative may request at least two business days prior to the sale of registrable securities to the underwriters. 5.7. cooperate with the holders in connection with any filings required to be made with the national association of securities dealers, inc. (the "nasd"), and otherwise use its best efforts to comply with the rules, by-laws and regulations of the nasd as they apply to the registration. 5.8. furnish to the holder such numbers of copies of the registration statement, any pre-effective or post-effective amendment thereto, the prospectus, including each preliminary prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, in each case in conformity with the requirements of the securities act and the rules thereunder, and such other related documents as the holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the distribution of registrable securities owned by the holder. 5.9. use the company's commercially reasonable efforts (i) to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such states or jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the underwriters' representative, and (ii) to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of the offer and transfer of any of the registrable securities in any jurisdiction, at the earliest possible moment; provided, however, that the company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions. 5.10. in the event of any underwritten offering, enter into and perform the company's obligations under an underwriting agreement (including indemnification and contribution obligations of underwriters or agents in the form set forth in section 8), in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter or underwriters of or agents for such offering. the company shall also cooperate with the holder, and the underwriters' representative for such offering in the marketing, and customary selling efforts relating to the registrable securities, including participating in customary "road show" presentations as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters' representative. 5.11. promptly notify the holder of any stop order issued or threatened to be issued by the commission in connection therewith and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered. 5.12. make available for inspection by the holder, any underwriter participating in such offering and the representatives of the holder and such underwriter all financial and other information as shall be reasonably requested by them, and provide the holder, any underwriter participating in such offering and the representatives of the holder and such underwriter the reasonable opportunity to discuss the business affairs of the company with its principal executives and independent public accountants who have certified the audited financial statements included in such registration statement, in each case all as necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibilities under the securities act; provided, however, that information that the company determines, in its reasonable and good faith judgment, to be confidential and which the company advises such person in writing, is confidential shall not be disclosed unless such person signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to the company and the holder of registrable securities agrees to be responsible for such person's breach of confidentiality on terms reasonably satisfactory to the company. 5.13. use the company's commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a so-called "comfort letter" from its independent public accountants, and legal opinions of counsel to the company addressed to the holder, in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by such letters, and in a form that shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holder. the company shall furnish to the holder a signed counterpart of any such comfort letter or legal opinion. delivery of any such opinion or comfort letter shall be subject to the recipient furnishing such written representations or acknowledgments as are customarily provided by selling shareholders who receive such comfort letters or opinions. 5.14. provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all registrable securities covered by such registration statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of such registration statement. 5.15. use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registrable securities covered by such registration statement to continue to be listed on all exchanges where the company's common stock is listed and to be registered with or approved by such other united states or state governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the company to enable the holder to consummate the distribution of the registrable securities which are included in such registration. 5.16. take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the registration of registrable securities included in such registration. section 6. holder's obligations. 6.1 it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to this agreement with respect to the registrable securities which are included in such registration that the holder shall furnish to the company such information regarding the holder and any participating permitted holder group transferee, the number of the registrable securities owned by it and any participating permitted holder group transferee, and the intended method of distribution of such registrable securities as shall be required to effect the registration of such registrable securities, and to cooperate with the company in preparing such registration. 6.2 the holder agrees, and each permitted holder group transferee shall be deemed by acceptance of registrable securities to have agreed, that, upon receipt of any notice of the company pursuant to clauses (ii) through (iv) of section 5.3 and section 5.4 hereof, the holder and each permitted holder group transferee will discontinue disposition of such registrable securities covered by such registration statement until such holder's or permitted holder group transferee's receipt of copies of the supplemental or amended prospectus contemplated by section 5.4 hereof, or until advised in writing (the "advice") by the company that the use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed. if the company shall give any notice under clauses (ii) through (iv) of section 5.3 or section 5.4 hereof during the period that the company is required to maintain an effective registration statement (the "effectiveness period"), such effectiveness period shall be extended by the number of days during such period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when each seller of registrable securities covered by such registration statement shall have received (x) the copies of the supplemental or amended prospectus contemplated by section 5.4 (if an amended or supplemental prospectus is required) or (y) the advice (if no amended or supplemental prospectus is required). section 7. expenses of registration. expenses in connection with registrations pursuant to this agreement shall be allocated and paid as follows: 7.1. with respect to the first two demand registrations effected pursuant to section 2 hereof, the company shall bear and pay, and with respect to each additional demand registration, the holder shall bear and pay, all expenses incurred in connection with any registration, filing, or qualification of registrable securities with respect to such demand registration, including all registration, filing and national association of securities dealers, inc. fees, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws, all word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, and of the company's independent public accountants, including the expenses of "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance (the "registration expenses"), but in no event shall the company bear underwriting discounts and commissions relating to registrable securities or fees and expenses of holder's counsel (which shall be paid by the holder) and provided that the company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration begun pursuant to section 2 if the registration is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holder (in which case the holder shall bear such expense), other than by reason of failure of the company to comply with section 5.12 or if the proviso of such section becomes applicable unless the holder agrees that such withdrawn registration shall constitute one of the demand registrations under section 2 hereof. 7.2. the company shall bear and pay all registration expenses incurred in connection with any shelf registrations pursuant to section 4 and any piggyback registrations pursuant to section 3 for the holder, but excluding, incremental registration and qualification fees and expenses (including underwriting discounts and commissions relating to registrable securities) and any incremental costs and disbursements (including fees and expenses of the holder's counsel) that result from the inclusion of the registrable securities in any piggyback registrations (each of which shall be paid by the holder). section 8. indemnification; contribution. if any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under this agreement: 8.1. to the extent permitted by applicable law, the company shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder and each permitted holder group transferee, each person, if any, who controls such holder or permitted holder group transferee within the meaning of the securities act, and each officer, director, partner, and employee of the holder and each permitted holder group transferee, and any such controlling person, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (joint or several), including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendments or supplements thereto; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the securities act, the exchange act, any applicable state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the exchange act or any applicable state securities law; provided, however, that the indemnification required by this section 8.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by the indemnified party expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided, further, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 8 shall not apply to any underwriter to the extent that any such loss is based on or arises out of an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or an omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, contained in or omitted from any preliminary prospectus if the final prospectus shall correct such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or such omission or alleged omission, and a copy of the final prospectus has not been sent or given to such person at or prior to the confirmation of sale to such person if such underwriter was under an obligation to deliver such final prospectus and failed to do so. the company shall also indemnify underwriters participating in the distribution, their officers, directors, agents and employees and each person who controls such persons (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holder provided, however, that no such underwriter shall be entitled to indemnification under this agreement if such person shall have entered into a separate underwriting or indemnification agreement with the company. 8.2. to the extent permitted by applicable law, the holder shall indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who shall have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, and each officer, director, partner, and employee of the company and such controlling person, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (joint and several), including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to which any of the foregoing may otherwise become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by the holder specifically for use in connection with such registration; provided, further, however, that the indemnification required by this section 8.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, further, however, in no event shall the liability of the holder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds by the holder upon sale of registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 8.3. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may make a claim under this section 8, such indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; subject to the rights of an indemnified party to retain its own counsel as hereinafter provided. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time following the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 8 but shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than pursuant to this section 8. any fees and expenses incurred by the indemnified party (including any fees and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or proceeding) owed by the indemnifying party hereunder shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within thirty (30) days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (subject to refund if it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). any such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expenses of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to promptly assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding or (iii) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party and that the assertion of such defenses would create a conflict of interest such that counsel employed by the indemnifying party could not faithfully represent the indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action, claim or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
