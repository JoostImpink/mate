intended method of disposition set forth in such registration statement for such period; (c) furnish to each seller of registrable stock and to each underwriter such number of copies of the registration statement and the prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus) as such persons reasonably may request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the registrable stock covered by such registration statement; (d) use all reasonable commercial efforts to register or qualify the registrable stock covered by such registration statement under the securities or &#147;blue sky&#148; laws of such jurisdictions as the sellers of registrable stock or, in the case of an underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter reasonably shall request, provided , however , that the company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to transact business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; (e) use all reasonable commercial efforts to list the registrable stock covered by such registration statement with any securities exchange on which the common stock of the company is then listed; (f) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such registrable stock not later than the effective date of such registration statement; (g) immediately notify each seller of registrable stock and each underwriter under such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus contained in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and at the request of any such seller prepare and furnish to such seller a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable stock, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing;
