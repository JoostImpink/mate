us$1.00 = hk$7.7522), for a total of 917,759,172 sale shares (the "purchase price"). the purchase price will be funded though a combination of (i) approximately us$130.2 million which was paid by orascom telecom and orascom eurasia in cash to htihl at the closing of the share purchase transaction, which occurred on december 21, 2005 (the "closing") from available working capital and (ii) approximately us$1.17 billion initially funded at closing through a vendor promissory note (the "vendor promissory note") payable by orascom eurasia to htihl. the stated maturity of the vendor

the reporting persons' belief that the issuer represents an attractive and strategic investment in a company active in complementary markets, based on the issuer's business prospects, strategy and market opportunities. the reporting persons' purpose of entering into the share purchase agreement was in order to participate and invest in the markets in which the issuer operates. depending upon prevailing market, economic and other conditions, one or both of the reporting persons may from time to time acquire additional shares of the issuer or engage in discussions with the issuer and/or other shareholders of the issuer concerning further acquisitions of ordinary shares of the issuer or further investments in the issuer. the reporting persons intend to review their investment in the issuer on a continuing basis and, depending upon the price and availability of the issuer's ordinary shares, subsequent developments affecting the issuer, the issuer's business and prospects, other investment and business opportunities available to the reporting persons, general stock market, industry and economic conditions, tax considerations and other factors considered relevant to their investment decision, may decide at any time to increase (including upon exercise of the orascom option (as defined below)) or to decrease (subject to the limitations described below) the size of their investment in the issuer. 12 on december 21, 2005, orascom eurasia and orascom telecom entered into the following agreements in connection with the purchase of the sale shares: share purchase

terms of a share purchase agreement dated as of december 21, 2005 (the "share purchase agreement") among htihl, hwl, orascom eurasia and orascom telecom (the "share purchase transaction"). orascom telecom paid htihl, at the closing of the share purchase transaction, hk$11.00 per sale share (or approximately us$1.42 per sale share based on the closing spot market rate quoted by bloomberg on december 19, 2005, of us$1.00 = hk$7.7522), for a total consideration of approximately us$1.30 billion, comprising approximately us$130.2 million in cash and the vendor promissory note for us$1.17 billion. see item 3 above for a description of the financing arrangements among htihl, orascom telecom and orascom eurasia for purchase of the sale shares. in accordance with the share charge, at closing the sale shares were transferred to hsbc nominees (hong kong) limited, acting for the benefit of htihl. upon completion of the share purchase transaction, the reporting persons became the beneficial owner (subject to the limitations set forth herein) of 917,759,172 ordinary shares, or approximately 19.3% of the 4,752,546,209 ordinary shares of the issuer which were issued and outstanding as of december 21, 2005. a copy of the share purchase agreement has been filed herewith as exhibit 2 to this schedule 13d and is hereby incorporated herein by this reference. shareholders' agreement in conjunction with the share purchase agreement as described above, htihl, hwl, orascom eurasia and orascom telecom entered into a shareholders' agreement (the "shareholders' agreement") dated as of december 21, 2005. an aggregate of 3,284,628,901 ordinary shares are subject to the shareholders' agreement, of which 917,759,172 ordinary shares are the sale shares sold to orascom telecom and transferred to orascom eurasia pursuant to the share purchase agreement. the number of ordinary shares covered by the shareholders' agreement represents approximately 69.1% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the issuer as of december 21, 2005. the shareholders' agreement provides for certain obligations and restrictions with respect to the voting and disposition of the ordinary shares to be held directly or indirectly by orascom eurasia and htihl, and for the orascom option, as defined and described below. board representation and voting agreements the shareholders' agreement provides, inter alia, that: (a) htihl and orascom eurasia shall each be entitled to nominate two (2) non-executive directors for election to the board of directors of the issuer (the "issuer's board"); (b) the issuer's board shall be comprised of not more than nine (9) directors, consisting of two (2) executive directors, four (4) non-executive directors (as referenced in (a) above) and three (3) independent non-executive directors; (c) htihl shall procure that such directors nominated by orascom eurasia shall be appointed to the issuer's board, and that existing directors of the issuer's board as is necessary to achieve the issuer's board composition set out in b) above, shall resign; (d) each of htihl and orascom eurasia shall use its respective voting rights in the ordinary shares to support the formation of a finance committee of the issuer's board that shall be comprised of four (4) directors, of which two (2) are to be nominated by htihl and two (2) are to be nominated by orascom eurasia, to carry out certain corporate governance functions related to the business of the issuer; (e) orascom eurasia and htihl shall exercise their voting rights to support orascom eurasia's proposal for the issuer to make one nomination to each of the boards of directors, or coordinating committee, as the case may be, of certain subsidiaries of the issuer in india, indonesia and vietnam (each a "subsidiary nominee" and together the "subsidiary nominees"), and each of htihl and orascom eurasia shall use its respective voting rights to support the appointment of the subsidiary nominees in india and indonesia and htihl shall use best endeavors to effect the appointment of the subsidiary nominee in vietnam subject to certain provisos set forth in the shareholders' agreement; (f) orascom eurasia shall make certain undertakings to htihl in respect of the subsidiary nominees, including that orascom eurasia will procure that each subsidiary nominee vote or abstain from voting at its respective board meeting in accordance with the vote of the respective nominee to that board made by htihl; (g) each of htihl and orascom eurasia shall exercise its respective voting rights to oppose the issue of any ordinary shares or other securities of the issuer that are convertible or exchangeable into ordinary shares, or options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, to any person who is, or who is an affiliate of, a telecommunications operator, other than in circumstances where the issue of such securities is as consideration in return for acquiring a minority interest in the issuer or any of the issuer's subsidiaries, or where such securities are issued with no rights attaching to them other than such rights attaching to such securities pursuant to the issuer's articles of association or relevant law, provided in aggregate such issue represents not more than 5% of the ordinary shares then issued and outstanding; and 13 (h) hwl has undertaken to exercise its voting rights to procure that none of the licenses for intellectual property rights related to the respective licensee's telecommunications operations that have been granted to htil or any of its subsidiaries by hwl or any of its subsidiaries will be terminated or modified to the detriment of the licensee as a result of the closing of the share purchase transaction or the exercise of the orascom option (as defined below). disposition of ordinary shares the shareholders' agreement also provides, inter alia, that: (a) each of htihl and orascom eurasia has granted the other a right of first refusal to purchase its respective ordinary shares in the event such party shall wish to sell its ordinary shares; (b) in the event that htihl wishes to sell 10% or more of the total number of the ordinary shares of the issuer then issued and outstanding (the "offer shares"), orascom eurasia shall have the right to deliver a written notice to htihl requiring htihl to include in its sale an aggregate number of ordinary shares held by orascom eurasia up to a pro rata number of offer shares (the "tag-along shares"). if the proposed sale by htihl results in htihl's attributable shareholding falling below 30%, then orascom eurasia shall be entitled to "tag" its then entire shareholding into such proposed sale. htihl shall procure that the sale of such tag-along shares shall be effected at the same price per offer share and otherwise on no less favorable terms than those that apply to the offer shares; and (c) subject to the rights of first refusal and the "tag-along" rights described above in (a) and (b), respectively, each of htihl and orascom eurasia has agreed that it will not, and htihl shall procure that new brilliant holdings limited will not, dispose of any ordinary shares held by it during a period of two years from the date of the closing of the share purchase transaction, except that each of htihl and orascom eurasia shall be entitled during this period, in one or more transactions, to dispose of no more than 5% in aggregate of the total number of ordinary shares of the issuer that are issued and outstanding from time to time, provided that the minimum number of ordinary shares that may be disposed of in any single transaction shall be 1% of the total number of ordinary shares of the issuer that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to such disposal, and that any such transfer shall be subject to the rights of first refusal referenced in (a) above. the orascom option the shareholders' agreement grants orascom eurasia a conditional option (the "orascom option") to purchase from htihl such number of ordinary shares of the issuer as shall immediately prior to the closing of the orascom option represent approximately 3.69% of the total number of ordinary shares of the issuer then issued and outstanding at a price per ordinary share of the higher of (i) the average of the closing traded price of an ordinary share for the thirty (30) trading days on the stock exchange of hong kong limited immediately prior to the date that orascom eurasia delivers to htihl a notice to exercise the orascom option, and (ii) hk$11.00, being the price per sale share payable under the share purchase agreement. based on the number of ordinary shares of the issuer issued and outstanding as of december 21, 2005 of 4,753,546,209, the number of ordinary shares subject to the orascom option is 175,326,456 ordinary shares. the exercise of the orascom option is contingent upon the earlier of (i) the receipt of consent from the ministry of communications of the state of israel, or any other government authority that may exercise jurisdiction over the direct or indirect control of partner communications company ltd. ("partner"), in which the issuer had approximately a 51.8% shareholding as of december 21, 2005, to the increase in orascom eurasia's attributable shareholding in partner to a percentage that is equal to or greater than 10%, or (ii) the disposal by the issuer of its entire shareholding in partner. if this condition has not been fulfilled or waived by htihl, or if the issuer's interest in partner is not sold or otherwise disposed of, by one year from the date of the closing of the share purchase transaction, the orascom option shall lapse and cease to be of effect and neither party shall have any rights or liabilities in respect of the orascom option under the shareholders' agreement. as such, orascom telecom believes that htihl retains beneficial ownership of all ordinary shares subject to the orascom option. termination the rights and obligations of orascom eurasia and orascom telecom under the shareholders' agreement shall terminate in the event that orascom eurasia, orascom telecom or a wholly-owned subsidiary of orascom telecom holds less than 570,305,545 ordinary shares (as equitably adjusted), or approximately 12% (the "deemed 12%") of the total number of ordinary shares of the issuer then issued and outstanding, but htihl continues to hold not less than 30% of the ordinary shares, in which case certain of htihl's non-voting rights under the shareholders' agreement shall remain in effect. the rights and obligations of htihl and its affiliates under the shareholders' agreement shall terminate in the event that htihl and its affiliates hold less than 30% of the total number of ordinary shares of the issuer then issued and outstanding, but orascom eurasia and its affiliates continue to hold not less than the deemed 12%, in which case certain of orascom eurasia's non-voting rights under the shareholders' agreement shall remain in effect. if at any time the aggregate holding of htihl and orascom eurasia and their respective affiliates is reduced to 50% or less of the total number of ordinary shares of the issuer then issued and outstanding, the voting rights under the shareholders' agreement shall terminate. 14 a copy of the shareholders' agreement has been filed herewith as exhibit 3 to this schedule 13d and is hereby incorporated herein by this reference. amended and restated registration rights agreement htihl, cheung kong (holdings) limited ("cheung kong") and the issuer previously had entered into a registration rights agreement (the "registration rights agreement") dated as of september 24, 2004, under which each of htihl and cheung kong were entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of its respective securities of the issuer, including ordinary shares. a copy of the registration rights agreement was filed as an exhibit to the issuer's registration statement on form f-1 (no. 333-118783). in conjunction with the share purchase transaction, the issuer entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the "amended registration rights agreement") dated as of december 21, 2005 with htihl, cheung kong and orascom eurasia (each a "shareholder" and together the "shareholders"), extending the rights under the registration rights agreement to orascom eurasia. the amended registration rights agreement covers the ordinary shares of the issuer, any other class of equity securities of the issuer, any depositary receipts of the issuer and any equity, rights or equity-linked securities distributed in respect of such ordinary shares or depositary receipts, as the case may be (together, the "registrable securities"), that are held from time to time by a shareholder. the amended registration rights agreement provides for demand registration rights pursuant to which the issuer must generally comply with the request of the shareholders to register registrable securities on their behalf, and "piggyback" registration rights pursuant to which the shareholders may request registration of their registrable securities when the issuer registers such registrable securities. the issuer is required to bear all registration fees and expenses related to registrations under the amended registration rights agreement, excluding any underwriting discounts or selling commissions. demand registration each of the shareholders may, from time to time, request that the issuer register all or any portion of its respective registrable securities, provided that the number of registrable securities requested to be so registered represents at least 1% in the case of htihl and cheung kong, and at least 5% in the case of orascom eurasia, of all ordinary shares of the issuer then issued and outstanding (a "demand registration"). the total number of registrable securities included in the demand registration will be subject to certain limitations imposed by the underwriters for such sale. each of htihl and cheung kong may make an unlimited number of requests for a demand registration; orascom eurasia may make one request for a demand registration at any time during a three-hundred sixty-five (365) day period and an additional request for a demand registration at any time during that same three-hundred sixty-five (365) day period with the approval of htihl, except that unless htihl has requested or has elected to participate in a demand registration, orascom eurasia shall have no right to make a request for or to participate in a demand registration at any time when any amount remains payable by it under the vendor promissory note or by orascom telecom under the terms of the guarantee. the issuer is obligated to register such registrable securities under a registration statement and is to use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such registration statement promptly to be declared effective under the u.s. securities act of 1933 (the "securities act"). the issuer is not obligated to file a registration statement for a demand registration (a "demand registration statement") at any time during the one hundred eighty (180) day period following the effective date of a previous demand registration statement. each of the shareholders may make a written request to the issuer to initiate a public offering in any jurisdiction other than hong kong or the united states (an "alternative listing jurisdiction") of all or any portion of its respective registrable securities, provided that the number of registrable securities requested to be so registered represents at least 1% in the case of htihl and cheung kong, and at least 5% in the case of orascom eurasia, of all ordinary shares of the issuer then issued and outstanding. the total number of registrable securities included in such a demand registration in an alternative listing jurisdiction will be subject to certain limitations imposed by the underwriters for such sale. the issuer is obligated to register such registrable securities under a registration statement in the alternative listing jurisdiction and to take all necessary action to comply with all applicable securities laws of the alternative listing jurisdiction. piggyback registration the issuer shall give notice to the shareholders of a registration of registrable securities, other than a registration pursuant to a form s-4 or s-8 or pursuant to an offering and sale to employees or directors pursuant to any employee stock or benefit plan or arrangement. such notice shall offer the shareholders the opportunity to register such number of registrable securities as the shareholder may request (a "piggyback registration"), and any shareholder participating in such piggyback registration shall be entitled to participate on the same terms as the issuer and any other persons selling securities in such offering. however, unless htihl has elected to participate in such piggyback registration, orascom eurasia shall not have the right to participate in a piggyback registration at any time when any amount remains payable by it under the vendor promissory note or by orascom telecom under the terms of the guarantee. the amended registration rights agreement provides that the number of registrable securities included by a shareholder in a piggyback registration that is an underwritten public offering by the issuer may be reduced if and to the extent the underwriters for such offering determine that the number of registrable securities to be included in the registration exceeds the number that the underwriters believe they can sell. to the extent that a shareholder participating in a piggyback registration holds 5% or more ordinary shares of the issuer then issued and outstanding, such shareholder shall not effect any public sale or distribution (except, in each case, as pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act) of any securities that are the same as or similar to those being registered in connection with such registration for a period beginning seven (7) days before and ending ninety (90) days after the effective date of the registration statement being filed in connection with such piggyback registration. 15 termination the amended registration rights agreement shall terminate in its entirety upon the earlier of i) the date as of which all of the registrable securities have been sold pursuant to a registration statement, or ii) the date as of which each of the shareholders are permitted to sell their registrable securities under rule 144(k) under the securities act. the amended registration rights agreement shall terminate between the issuer and either htihl or cheung kong, as the case may be, on the date that the number of each class of registrable securities beneficially owned by such shareholder is less than 1% of all ordinary shares of the issuer that are then issued and outstanding; and the amended registration rights agreement shall terminate between the issuer and orascom eurasia on the date that orascom eurasia holds less than 12% of all ordinary shares of the issuer that are then issued and outstanding solely as a result of sales of its holdings of ordinary shares, subject to certain provisions of the share charge. a copy of the amended registration rights agreement has been filed herewith as exhibit 4 to this schedule 13d and is hereby incorporated herein by this reference. other

place of that purchaser nominee in relation to any resolution, the purchaser nominee (if in attendance at the meeting) shall abstain and express no view or opinion on the relevant matter. in such circumstances, the purchaser shall be in breach of its undertakings under this clause 7 unless: (i) the purchaser nominee, acting reasonably, considers that the casting of any vote (including by

nomination any person(s) from time to time become a purchaser nominee in accordance with this agreement in place of any of the person(s) recommended by it for appointment to a subsidiary board under clause 4.1, and upon receipt of such recommendation from the purchaser, each of the purchaser and the seller shall use its voting and procurement rights to support the appointment of such purchaser nominee. 7.7 oth and the purchaser undertake to use their voting and procurement rights at all times in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. 8. termination of rights to appoint nominees

termination shall be without prejudice to any rights the seller may have as a result of such breach whether under this agreement or otherwise; and (ii) in the event that any company is seeking to list on a stock exchange and, in the view of any reputable investment bank managing the listing the continuation of clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 of this agreement in relation to such company would cause the company to be in breach of any applicable laws, regulations, by-laws or statutes, or otherwise prevent the implementation of the listing, provided that any termination under this clause 8.1(ii) shall take effect in relation only to the purchaser nominee on the relevant subsidiary board and not in relation to any rights or obligations relevant to any other purchaser nominee. 20 8.2 in the event of any termination pursuant to clause 8.1(ii), the parties shall work together and use their best endeavours to find, as soon as reasonably practicable, a mutually acceptable means of conferring upon the purchaser and oth the nearest reasonably practicable equivalent rights to those which the purchaser and oth had in relation to their purchaser nominee. 9. anti-dilution rights 9.1 each of the seller

the general mandate at that time. 10. action with respect to partner each of the purchaser and the seller covenant to use its voting and procurement rights to procure that htil and partner co-operate with the purchaser to pursue, as soon as reasonably practicable after the share purchase closing, an application for moc's consent to the increase in the purchaser's attributable shareholding in partner to a percentage that is equal to or greater than 10 per cent., resulting from the acquisition of the option shares, and the purchaser agrees to give htil and partner all reasonable assistance to obtain the moc consent ("moc consent"). 11. purchaser's share option 11.1 in consideration of the payment by the purchaser to the seller of the sum of hk$100, receipt of which is acknowledged, the

option by serving an exercise notice on the seller during the period beginning on the date that the purchaser receives written notice of the moc consent or the date of the transfer by htil (or its subsidiary) of its shareholding in partner, whichever occurs first, and ending at midnight on the first anniversary of the date of share purchase closing. the share option may only be exercised in respect of all (and not some only) of the option shares. 11.4 the option shares shall be sold by the seller with all rights as at the date of option closing or in the future thereafter attaching to them (including the right to receive all dividends, distributions or any return of capital declared, made or paid on or after that date by reference to a record date occurring on or after option closing). additionally, the seller shall covenant and confirm to the purchaser (or its nominee referred to in clause 11.6) that (i) it has the right to transfer legal and beneficial title to the option shares, and (ii) the option shares are sold and purchased free from all encumbrances. 11.5 the exercise of the share option shall be conditional on the grant of the moc consent or the transfer by htil (or its subsidiary) of its entire shareholding in partner, whichever occurs first. the seller may waive such condition at any time by notice in writing to the purchaser. if the condition has not been fulfilled or waived or htil's interest in partner is not sold or otherwise disposed of, by the date which falls on the first anniversary of the date of share purchase closing (or such later date as the parties may agree in writing), the share option shall lapse and cease to be of effect, and neither party shall (provided it shall have satisfied its obligations in clause 10) have any rights or liabilities in respect of the share option under this agreement. 11.6 the purchaser shall be entitled to nominate a wholly owned subsidiary of the purchaser or oth to purchase the option shares, provided that it shall be a condition of the transfer of option shares that the purchaser's nominee executes a deed of adherence. 11.7 closing of the sale and purchase of the option shares

option shares in favour of the purchaser (or its nominee); (ii) the share certificate(s) representing the option shares; and (iii) such other documents as may be necessary to enable the purchaser (or its nominee) to obtain good title to the option shares. 22 the seller's obligation to deliver all of the above documents is subject to the seller receiving a written confirmation from the bank nominated by it to receive the proceeds payable in respect of the option shares, that the full amount of the option price for the option shares in us$ has been received in immediately available funds.

following delivery of a written notice by the purchaser or a security agent to htil requesting that a removal be effected and declaring that the holder of the relevant option shares (if someone other than the purchaser or the security agent) is an affiliate of the purchaser. 11.9 for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this agreement shall prohibit the purchaser from buying additional shares on the market in accordance with the terms of this agreement, provided that oth and the purchaser acknowledge that, with reference to a letter dated 30 may, 2004 from the moc to partner (a copy

or acquisition of shares, as a result of public trading, shall not be considered a breach of the partner licence, subject to full compliance with the conditions set out in articles 3 and 4 of a letter from htil dated 27 may, 2004, a copy of which has also been made available to oth and the purchaser shall comply with such conditions where compliance has the effect of avoiding a breach of the partner licence. 12. standstill on disposals of shares subject to clauses 15.1 and 15.2, each of the seller and the purchaser undertakes with the other that it shall not, and the seller shall procure

to clauses 14 and 15, if at any time either the seller (which shall include new brilliant) or the purchaser (the "offeror") desires to transfer any shares (the "offered shares"), the other party(ies) (the "offeree(s)") shall have a right of first refusal to purchase the offered shares, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this clause 13. 13.3 prior to any transfer of offered shares, the offeror shall have delivered to the offeree a notice (a "transfer notice") containing the following: (i) where such transfer is to be effected as an off-market transaction, (a) a statement to that effect, and (b) a written bona fide offer which is binding and is not subject to any condition precedent that is related to the financing of the acquisition of the offered shares, from a third party to purchase the offered shares, stating the name and address of the proposed purchaser(s) (including the name of any wider group of companies to which it belongs) (the "proposed transferee"), the number of shares to be transferred pursuant to such bona fide written offer, the purchase price, the terms and conditions upon which such shares are proposed to be transferred, the date of the proposed transfer of the shares and the number of shares (the "retained shares") that would continue to be held by the seller (expressed as a percentage of the total number of shares in issue

an on-market transaction, (a) a statement to that effect and (b) the number of shares to be sold, and (c) the price at which it is proposed the shares be sold. 13.4 after receipt of a transfer notice,

conditions as those set out in the transfer notice, which election shall be made by a written notice delivered by the offeree to the offeror (an "election notice"): (i) where the transfer of shares is to be effected as an off-market transaction, 45 days from the date of service of the transfer notice; (ii) where the transfer of shares is to be an on-market transaction that would constitute an unregistered offering, 10 days from the date of service of the transfer notice; or (iii) where the transfer of shares is proposed to be an on-market transaction that would constitute a registered offering, 30 days from the date of service of the transfer notice, provided that if as a consequence of the transfer of the offered shares to a proposed transferee, the aggregate holding would thereby be reduced to 50 per cent. or less of the shares in issue from time to time, then the offeree shall be entitled, with the object of maintaining the aggregate holding above that percentage figure, to accept the offer contained in the transfer notice in respect of part only of the offered shares. 24 13.5 if by the expiry of the offer period, the offeree has not served an election notice on the offeror, or if before that time, the offeree has served on the offeror a written notice that the offeree does not intend to exercise its rights of first refusal ("non-exercise notice"), the offeror may, within the period commencing on the date of expiry of the offer period, or if earlier, the date of service of a non-exercise notice (if served) (the "sale period commencement date"), and ending

(1%) of all issued and outstanding shares. notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event that orascom makes a written request to the company pursuant to this section 2.1(a) for registration of all or part of the outstanding registrable securities held by it or any of its affiliates, the number of such registrable securities requested to be so registered by orascom must represent at least five per cent (5%) of all issued and outstanding shares at such time. a registration that is undertaken by the company in response to a valid request made by a shareholder pursuant to this section 2.1 shall be referred to herein as a "demand registration." each such request shall specify the class and the aggregate amount and class of registrable securities to be registered and the intended methods of disposition and distribution thereof. the company shall file, as promptly as practicable (and in any event, within sixty (60) days) following receipt of a request for a demand registration, a registration statement relating to such demand registration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such registration statement promptly to be declared effective under the securities act, the "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the shareholder or underwriter, if any, reasonably request, or any other law, as applicable, and to cause such registration statement to remain effective until the later of (i) the date all registrable securities have been sold or (ii) nine (9) months after the effective date of such registration statement. (b) each shareholder other than orascom may make an unlimited number of requests for a demand registration pursuant to section 2.1(a). orascom may make one request for a demand registration pursuant to section 2.1(a) at any time during a three-hundred sixty-five (365) day period and an additional request for a demand registration pursuant to section 2.1(a) at any time during that same three-hundred sixty-five (365) day period with the approval of htihl, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. unless htihl has requested or has elected to participate in a demand registration, orascom shall have no right to make a request for or to participate in a demand registration at any time when any amount remains payable by it under the promissory note or by the parent under the terms of the parent guarantee. notwithstanding the above, the company shall not be required to file a registration statement for a demand registration at any time during the one hundred eighty (180) day period following the effective date of another such demand registration statement. (c) any shareholder and/or its affiliates may withdraw their registrable securities from a demand registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of the applicable registration statement. upon receipt of a written notice from a shareholder to such effect, the company shall cease all efforts to secure registration of such registrable securities. (d) promptly upon receipt of any request for a demand registration pursuant to section 2.1(a) (but in no event more than ten (10) business days thereafter), the company shall deliver a written notice (a "demand notice") of any such registration request to all other holders of registrable securities, and the company shall include in such demand registration all such registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein from such holders within twenty-one (21) days after the 7 date that the demand notice has been delivered. all requests made pursuant to this section 2.l(d) shall specify the class and aggregate amount of registrable securities to be registered and the intended method of distribution of such securities. (e) if a shareholder that has requested a demand registration so elects, the offering of registrable securities pursuant to such demand registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering. if any offering pursuant to a demand registration involves an underwritten offering, such shareholder shall have the right to select the underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering; provided, that such underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the company. (f) if at any time the managing underwriter or underwriters (the "managing underwriter") of a proposed underwritten offering of a class of registrable securities included in a demand registration (or in the case of a demand registration not being underwritten, the shareholder requesting such demand registration) informs the holders of such class of registrable securities in writing that, in its opinion, the total number of company securities of such class proposed to be included in such demand registration exceeds the number which can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without being likely to have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the class of securities offered or the market for the class of securities offered, then the number of registrable securities of such class that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter (or, in the case of a demand registration which is not underwritten, the shareholder requesting such demand registration), can be included without having such an adverse effect shall be allocated as follows: (i) first, pro rata among the holders which have requested participation in the demand registration (based, for each such holder, on the percentage derived by dividing (i) the number of registrable securities of such class which such holder has requested to include in such demand registration by (ii) the aggregate number of registrable securities of such class which all such holders have requested to include); and (ii) second, and only if all the securities referenced in clause (i) have been included, pro rata among any other persons contractually entitled to participate in such demand registration (based, for each such person, on the percentage derived by dividing (i) the number of registrable securities of such class which such person has requested to include in such demand registration by (ii) the aggregate number of registrable securities of such class which all such persons have requested to include). (g) if the filing, initial effectiveness, publication or continued use of a registration statement in respect of a demand registration at any time would require the company to make an adverse disclosure, the company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such registration statement (a "demand suspension"); provided, however, that the company shall not be permitted to exercise a demand suspension (a) more than once during any six-month period, (b) for a period exceeding thirty (30) days on any one occasion or (c) for a period exceeding forty-five (45) days in any twelve-month period. in the case of a demand suspension, the holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice referred to above, use of the prospectus relating to such demand registration in connection with any sale or purchase, or offer to sell or purchase, registrable securities. 8 the company shall immediately notify the holders upon termination of any demand suspension, and amend or supplement the related prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement or omission and furnish to the holders such number of copies of such prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the holders may reasonably request. the company represents that, as of the date hereof, it has no knowledge of any circumstance that would reasonably be expected to cause it to exercise its rights under this section 2.1(g).
