(b) the purchase price at the time in effect; and (c) the number of shares of warrant stock and the amount, if any, of other property at the time receivable upon the exercise of the warrant. 3. restrictions on transfer . 3.1. restrictive legends . unless the shares issued upon exercise of this warrant are registered under the securities act of 1933 and under applicable laws of any state, each certificate for common stock issued upon the exercise of any warrant, and each certificate issued upon the transfer of any such common stock, shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form: the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or under the securities laws of any state. these securities may not be offered, sold, transferred, pledged or hypothecated in the absence of registration, or the availability of an exemption from registration, under the securities act of 1933 and appropriate state securities laws. furthermore, no offer, sale, transfer, pledge or hypothecation is to take place unless the company receives an opinion of counsel at shareholder&#146;s expense, and satisfactory to it, that an exemption from registration is available. 3 3.2. notice of proposed transfer ; opinions of counsel. prior to the transfer of any shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of this warrant and during any period during which such shares of common stock are not registered by the company under an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the securities act of 1933, the holder thereof shall give written notice to the company, which notice shall (a) state such holder&#146;s intention to transfer such restricted shares and to comply in all other respects with the transfer requirements of this warrant; (b) describe the circumstances of the proposed transfer in sufficient detail to enable counsel to render the opinions referred to below, and (c) designate counsel for the holder giving such notice. the holder giving such notice shall submit a copy thereof to the counsel designated in such notice and the company will promptly submit a copy thereof to its counsel. the following provisions shall then apply: (a) if (a) in the opinion of counsel for the holder designated in the notice the proposed transfer may be effected without registration of such shares of common stock under the securities act of 1933 and any applicable state securities laws, and (b) counsel for the company shall not have rendered an opinion within 15 days after receipt by the company of such written notice that such registration is required, such holder shall thereupon be entitled to transfer such shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by such holder to the company. each warrant or certificate, if any, issued upon or in connection with such transfer shall bear the appropriate restrictive legend set forth in section 3.1, unless in the opinion of each such counsel such legend is no longer required to insure compliance with the securities act. if for any reason counsel for the company (after having been furnished with the information required to be furnished by clause (a) of this section 3.2) shall fail to deliver an opinion to the company as aforesaid, then for all purposes of this warrant the opinion of counsel for the company shall be deemed to be the same as the opinion of counsel for such holder. (b) if in the opinion of either or both of such counsel the proposed transfer may not legally be effected without registration of such shares of common stock under the securities act of 1933 or applicable state securities laws (such opinion or opinions to state the basis of the legal conclusions reached therein), the company will promptly so notify the holder thereof and thereafter such holder shall not be entitled to transfer such shares of common stock until receipt of a further notice from the holder under section 3.2 above or until registration of such shares of common stock under the securities act or applicable state law has become effective. 4. reservation of shares . the company will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery upon the exercise of the warrants, the number of shares of warrant stock that would be issuable upon the exercise of all warrants at the time outstanding. all such shares shall be duly authorized and, when issued upon such exercise, shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable with no liability on the part of the holders thereof. 4 5. replacement of warrants . upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft of destruction of any warrant, upon delivery of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the company in form and amount or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender of such the company at its expense will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new warrant of like tenor. 6. no rights or liabilities as stockholder . nothing herein shall give or shall be construed to give the holder of this warrant any of the rights of a shareholder of the company including, without limitation, the right to vote on matters requiring the vote of shareholders, the right to receive any dividend declared and payable to the holders of common stock, and the right to a pro-rata distribution upon the company&#146;s dissolution. 7. notices . all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be delivered or mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed (a) if to the holders of any warrant, at the registered address of such holder as set forth in the register kept at the principal office of the company, or (b) if to the company, at its principal office to the attention of the company&#146;s chief financial officer, [company name and address], or at the address of such other principal office of the company as the company shall have furnished to each holder of any warrants in writing, provided that the exercise of any warrants shall be effective only in the manner provided in section 1. 8. assignment . no warrant granted herein or any of the rights and privileges thereby conferred shall be transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise), and no such warrant, right, or privilege shall be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process. upon any attempt so to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the warrant, or of any right or privilege conferred thereby, contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon which warrant, right, or privilege, the warrant and such rights and privileges shall immediately become null and void. 9. investment representations . in connection with its acquisition of this warrant, holder represents and warrants, and (unless the shares underlying this warrant are registered pursuant to the securities act of 1933) in connection with any exercise of this warrant holder will represent and warrant, as follows: 9.1. holder is acquiring the warrant and the warrant stock (together, the &#147;securities&#148;) for his its own account;
