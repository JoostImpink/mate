(iii) agreement and plan of merger agreement and plan of merger, dated as of november 13, 2001 (the "agreement"), among liquent, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), information holding inc., a delaware corporation ("parent"), and fluid acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("purchaser"). w i t n e s s e t h: - - - - - - - - - - whereas, the boards of directors of the company and purchaser have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders for purchaser to acquire the company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and whereas, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that purchaser will make a cash tender offer (the "offer") to acquire all shares (the "shares") of the issued and outstanding common stock, $.001 par value, of the company (the "company common stock") for $2.27 per share of company common stock or such higher price as may be paid in the offer (the "per share amount"), net to the seller in cash; and whereas, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the boards of directors of the company, purchaser and parent have each approved the merger of purchaser with and into the company (the "merger") following the offer in accordance with the delaware general corporation law (the "delaware code") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and whereas, as an inducement and a condition to parent's and purchaser's entering into this agreement, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this agreement, certain stockholders of the company have entered into a stockholders agreement with parent and purchaser (the "stockholders agreement"), pursuant to which each such stockholder has, among other things, agreed to tender its shares in the offer, granted to parent a proxy with respect to the voting of such shares and granted to parent an option to purchase such shares, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the stockholders agreement; and whereas, the board of directors of the company (the "board of directors") has approved this agreement and has determined that the consideration to be paid for each share in the offer and the merger is fair to the holders of such shares and has recommended that the holders of such shares accept the offer and approve this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the company, parent and purchaser hereby agree as follows: article i. the tender offer section 1.1. the offer. (a) provided that this agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with section 8.1 hereof and none of the events set forth in annex i hereto shall have occurred and be existing, purchaser or a direct or indirect subsidiary of parent as designated by parent shall commence (within the meaning of rule 14d-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act")) the offer as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this agreement, but in no event later than ten business days after the public announcement of the execution of this agreement. the obligation of purchaser to accept for payment any shares tendered shall be subject to the satisfaction of those conditions set forth in annex i. parent expressly reserves the right from time to time, subject to sections 1(b) and 1(d) hereof, to waive any such condition, to increase the per share amount, or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the offer. the per share amount shall be net to the seller in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by the seller. the company agrees that no shares held by the company or any of its subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) will be tendered pursuant to the offer. (b) without the prior written consent of the company, parent shall not (i) decrease the per share amount or change the form of consideration payable in the offer, (ii) decrease the number of shares sought, (iii) amend or waive satisfaction of the minimum condition (as defined in annex i) or (iv) impose additional conditions to the offer or amend any other term of the offer in any manner adverse to the holders of shares. upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, purchaser will, and parent will cause it to, accept for payment and purchase, as soon as permitted after expiration of the offer, all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer. (c) the offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "offer to purchase") having only the conditions set forth in annex i hereto. as soon as practicable on the date the offer is commenced, parent and purchaser shall file with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") a tender offer statement on schedule to (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "schedule to") with respect to the offer that will comply in all material respects with the provisions of such schedule to and all applicable federal securities laws, and will contain (including as an exhibit) or incorporate by reference the offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and other ancillary offer documents pursuant to which the offer will be made (which documents, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, are referred to collectively herein as the "offer documents"). parent and purchaser agree promptly to correct the schedule to or the offer documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect (and the company, with respect to written information supplied by it specifically for use in the schedule to or the offer documents, shall promptly notify parent of any required corrections of such information and shall cooperate with parent and purchaser with respect to correcting such information) and to supplement the information provided by it specifically for use in the schedule to or the offer documents to include any information that shall become -2- necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and parent and purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the schedule to, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the sec and the offer documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. the company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any offer documents before they are filed with the sec. in addition, parent and purchaser agree to use reasonable efforts to provide the company and its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that parent or purchaser or either of their counsel may receive from time to time from the sec or its staff with respect to the schedule to promptly after receipt of such comments and to consult with the company and its counsel prior to responding to such comments. (d) the offer to purchase shall provide for an initial expiration date of 20 business days (as defined in rule 14d-1 under the exchange act) from the date of commencement. purchaser agrees that it shall not terminate or withdraw the offer or extend the expiration date of the offer unless at the expiration date of the offer the conditions to the offer described in annex i hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived. if at the expiration date of the offer, the conditions to the offer described in annex i hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived, purchaser may, from time to time extend the expiration date of the offer until the date such conditions are satisfied or earlier waived and parent becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for shares tendered pursuant to the offer. notwithstanding the foregoing, purchaser may, without the consent of the company, (i) extend the expiration date of the offer (as it may be extended) for any period required by applicable rules and regulations of the sec in connection with an increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant to the offer and (ii) extend the expiration date of the offer (as it may be extended) for up to ten business days, if on such expiration date the conditions for the offer described on annex i hereto shall have been satisfied or earlier waived, but the number of shares that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn represents less than ninety percent (90%) of the then issued and outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. if any of the conditions to the offer are not satisfied or waived on any scheduled expiration date of the offer, purchaser shall extend the offer, if such condition or conditions could reasonably be expected to be satisfied, from time to time until the earlier of (i) the date such conditions are satisfied or waived and (ii) the 60th day after the commencement of the offer. section 1.2. company action. (a) the company hereby approves of and consents to the offer and represents and warrants that the board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held on november 13, 2001, at which all of the directors were present, unanimously: (i) approved and adopted this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the offer, the merger and parent's acquisition of shares pursuant to the stockholders agreement; (ii) recommended that the stockholders of the company accept the offer, tender their shares pursuant to the offer and approve this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the merger; (iii) determined that this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the offer and the merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the company; and (iv) took all action necessary to render the limitations on business combinations contained in section 203 of the delaware code inapplicable to this agreement, the stockholders agreement and the -3- transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. the company further represents and warrants that alliant partners ("alliant"), as financial advisor to the board of directors, delivered to the board of directors a written opinion, dated as of november 13, 2001, to the effect that the per share amount to be received by the stockholders (other than parent and purchaser) of the company pursuant to the offer and the merger is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view.
