is $0.07. if the company issues shares of common stock (or is deemed to issue shares of common stock) for a per share price less than the optional conversion price then in effect for the series d preferred stock prior to august 2, 2012, such optional conversion price will be reduced by a customary &#147;weighted average&#148;

or &#147;accrued dividends&#148;). such dividends shall accrue from day to day, whether or not earned or declared, and shall be cumulative. dividends shall be payable only when, as, and if declared by the board of directors of the company. no dividend or other distribution shall be paid, declared or set aside for payment on any share of common stock or any series of preferred stock expressly made junior to the series d preferred stock unless all dividends with respect to each outstanding share of the series d preferred stock have been or are simultaneously declared and paid in cash. pursuant to the series d certificate, in the event of the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up or upon a merger or acquisition of the company by another company or person, the holders of the series d preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference before any amounts are paid to the holders of common stock. the liquidation preference per share is equal to the greater of (i) 120% of the sum of (x) the stated value of such share plus (y) the accruing dividends relating thereto, and (ii) the amount which such holder would otherwise have received in respect of such share had all holders of series d preferred stock and series d-1 preferred stock converted their shares of series d preferred stock and series d-1 preferred stock into shares of common stock. each holder of outstanding shares of series d preferred stock shall be entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which the shares of series d preferred stock are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. holders of series d preferred stock shall vote together with the holders of common stock, and with holders of any other series of preferred stock the terms of which so provide, as a single class. the holders of series d preferred stock and series d-1 preferred stock have the right to approve (by a vote of at least 93% of the series d preferred stock and series d-1 preferred stock voting together as a single class) certain actions, including the creation or issuance of any class of preferred stock on par or senior to the series d preferred stock or series d-1 preferred stock. in addition, the holders of series c preferred stock, series d preferred stock and series d-1 preferred stock have the right to approve (by a majority of the shares of series c preferred stock, series d preferred stock and series d-1 preferred stock voting together as a single class) certain corporate actions, including certain changes of control and the incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money unless the issuer would have, after giving effect to such incurrence, an ebitda-to-interest ratio of at least 2:1. - 6 - common stock warrants the common stock warrants have an initial exercise price of $0.07 per share and include provisions (a) permitting the holder to exercise such common stock warrant through cashless &#147;net exercise election&#148; and (b) providing that, for a period of 18 months following the date of the purchase agreement, if the company issues shares of common stock (or is deemed to issue shares of common stock) for a price per share less than $0.07, then the exercise price of the common stock warrants will be reduced by a customary &#147;weighted-average&#148; anti-dilution formula (subject to certain exempted issuances). the common stock warrants are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of the authorized share increase. the terms of the common stock warrant are set forth in the common stock warrant attached hereto at exhibit 4. stockholders agreement on february 2, 2011, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the purchase agreement, gfi, oak, ubs americas, inc.

warrants to purchase common stock, each other series d stockholder shall have the right to sell a pro rata portion of its similar securities along with the selling series d stockholder. alternatively,

participate. the foregoing right to participate under the stockholders agreement shall terminate on such date as of which less than 25% of the shares of series d preferred stock remain outstanding. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, for so long as the series d stockholders collectively own at least 25% of the shares of series d preferred stock issued pursuant to the purchase agreement, the jefferies purchase agreement or the exchange agreement, or 25% of the shares of common stock issued upon the conversion thereof, (a) the company is required to nominate and use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be elected and cause to remain a director on the company&#146;s board of directors and (b) each series d stockholder is required to vote all shares of voting capital stock of the company owned by it, so as to elect, and not to vote to remove, one person designated in writing collectively by the series d stockholders (the &#147;series d designee&#148;). subject to the following - 7 - sentence, the consent of each of the series d stockholders holding at least 8% of the outstanding shares of series d preferred as of the date of the stockholders agreement shall be required in respect of the designation of the series d designee. notwithstanding the foregoing, for so long as oak continues to own at least 25% of the shares of series d preferred acquired by it pursuant to the purchase agreement or 25% of the common stock issued upon the conversion thereof, the series d designee shall be designated by oak in its sole discretion. subject to applicable law and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and any securities exchange or quotation system on which the company&#146;s securities are listed or quoted, the series d designee shall have a right to be a member of each principal committee of the company&#146;s board of directors. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, for so long as oak continues to own at least 25% of the shares of

in addition to oak&#146;s rights in respect of the series d designee. so long as any series d stockholder holding at least 8% of the outstanding shares of series d preferred or series d-1 preferred as of the date of the stockholders agreement owns at least 25% of the shares of series d preferred stock or series d-1 preferred stock, respectively, acquired by it pursuant to the purchase agreement,
