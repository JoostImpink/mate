ariad equity awards &#148;) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the consummation of the offer will accelerate and become fully vested (except that, in the case of a ariad performance stock unit, such awards shall vest at the greater of (i) the target level of vesting for such ariad performance stock unit and (ii) the vesting level determined based on the actual satisfaction of the performance metrics applicable to such ariad performance stock unit measured by the compensation committee of ariad&#146;s board of directors as of immediately prior to the offer expiration time) as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the consummation of the offer (subject to certain exceptions with respect to vesting acceleration) and will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the offer price (less the applicable exercise price in the case of ariad stock options) in cash, net of applicable withholding taxes and without interest, payable in respect of each share subject to such ariad equity award. at or prior to the consummation of the offer, ariad, its board of directors and the compensation committee of ariad&#146;s board of directors, as applicable, are required to adopt resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of the merger agreement with respect to the ariad equity awards. in addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, ariad is required, among other things, to take all reasonable actions to terminate its 1997 employee stock purchase plan prior to the date that the offer, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (collectively, the &#147;

(ii) any change in ariad&#146;s board of directors; and (iii) any proposed action, agreement or transaction involving ariad that would reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, adversely affect or prevent the consummation of the transactions. in addition, under the tender and support agreements, each supporting stockholder has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the shares beneficially owned by such supporting stockholder other than pursuant to the offer. the tender and support agreements will terminate upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, including a termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. in addition, the supporting stockholders&#146;
