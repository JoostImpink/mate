notice, the indemnified party against which such claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate therein at its own cost. in the event the indemnified party assumes the defense of the claim, the indemnified

(b) if, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the affairs of the corporation, the assets of the corporation shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full of the liquidation preference per share plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid on the bridge preferred stock and the full liquidating payments on all parity stock, then the assets of the corporation or the proceeds thereof shall be ratably distributed among the holders of bridge preferred stock and of any parity stock in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be entitled if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. (c) in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the affairs of the corporation upon completion of the distributions and payments required by subparagraph 4(a) and any other distributions and payments that may be required with respect to any other series of preferred stock that may be authorized after the initial issue date, the remaining assets of the corporation shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding shares of common stock and bridge preferred stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of common stock held by each such --- ---- holder (where, for this purpose, the holders of the bridge preferred stock shall be deemed to hold the number of shares of common stock then issuable upon conversion in full of such shares of bridge preferred stock). (d) written notice of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, stating the payment date or dates when and the place where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days prior to any payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of the shares of bridge preferred stock at their address as the same shall appear in the records of the corporation. 5. conversion rights. ----------------- 12 (a) following the initial conversion date, each of share of bridge preferred stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder, at any time before the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date (unless the corporation shall default in payment of the redemption price, in which case, the right of conversion shall be reinstated), into (i) a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock equal to (x) the liquidation preference of such share of bridge preferred stock, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, divided by (y) the conversion price and (ii) one (1) share of mezzanine preferred stock. immediately following such conversion, the rights of the holders of converted bridge preferred stock shall cease and the persons entitled to receive the common stock and mezzanine preferred stock upon the conversion of bridge preferred stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the owners of such common stock and mezzanine preferred stock. (b) if the required stockholder approval is obtained on or prior to the first anniversary of the initial issue date, each share of bridge preferred stock shall be automatically converted into one (1) share of permanent preferred stock, without any further action on the part of the corporation or any holder of bridge preferred stock. if the required stockholder approval is not obtained prior to the first anniversary of the initial issue date, (i) the bridge preferred stock will not automatically convert into shares of permanent preferred stock upon receipt of the required stockholder approval and (ii) each share of bridge preferred stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder, at any time after the date on which the required stockholder approval has been obtained and prior to the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date (unless the corporation shall default in payment of the redemption price, in which case, the right of conversion shall be reinstated), into one (1) share of permanent preferred stock. (c) if the bridge preferred stock is converted at the option of the holder, the holder must (i) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of bridge preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed at the principal office of the corporation or transfer agent for the bridge preferred stock, if any, (ii) notify the corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert bridge preferred stock, and the number of shares such holder wishes to convert, (iii) state in writing the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for the shares of common stock and mezzanine preferred stock or the permanent preferred stock, as the case may be, to be issued, and (iv) pay any transfer or similar tax if required (provided, -------- however, that no such payment shall be required if the common stock and - ------- mezzanine preferred stock or the permanent preferred stock, as the case may be, issuable upon conversion is to be issued in the name of the converting holder of bridge preferred stock). in the case of lost or destroyed certificates evidencing ownership of shares of bridge preferred stock to be surrendered for conversion, the holder shall submit such proof of loss or destruction and, if requested by the corporation, an appropriate indemnity, reasonably required by the corporation. in the event that a holder fails to notify the corporation of the number of shares of bridge preferred stock which he wishes to convert, he shall be deemed to have elected to convert all shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the date on which the holder satisfies all those requirements is the "optional conversion date." as ------------------------ soon as practicable after the optional conversion date, the corporation shall deliver or shall deliver through its transfer agent a certificate for the number of full shares of common stock and mezzanine preferred stock or permanent preferred stock, as the case may be, issuable upon the conversion, a check for any fractional share and a new certificate representing the unconverted portion, if any, of the shares of bridge preferred 13 stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the person in whose name the common stock and mezzanine preferred stock certificates or the permanent preferred stock certificate, as the case may be, are registered shall be treated as the stockholder of record on and after the optional conversion date until such time as the record ownership is transferred. all shares of common stock, mezzanine preferred stock or permanent preferred stock, as the case may be, issuable upon conversion of the bridge preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. in the case of bridge preferred stock that has been converted after any record date but before the next succeeding dividend payment date, dividends that are payable on such dividend payment date in an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the dividend for the portion of the dividend period that bridge preferred stock was outstanding shall be payable on such dividend payment date notwithstanding such conversion, and such dividends shall be paid to the person who was the holder of such bridge preferred stock on such record date (and shall not constitute "accrued and unpaid dividends" for purposes of paragraph 5(a)). no other payment or adjustment for dividends, or for any dividends in respect of shares of common stock shall be made upon conversion. holders of common stock issued upon conversion shall not be entitled to receive any dividend payable to holders of common stock as of any record time before the close of business on the conversion date. if a holder of bridge preferred stock converts more than one share at a time the number of full shares of common stock and mezzanine preferred stock or permanent preferred stock, as the case may be, issuable upon conversion shall be based on the total number of all shares of bridge preferred stock converted. (b) if the bridge preferred stock is converted automatically pursuant to subparagraph 5(b), such conversion shall be effective for all purposes on the date that the required stockholder approval has been obtained (the "automatic --------- conversion date"). following the automatic conversion date, the holder of - --------------- certificates formerly evidencing shares of bridge preferred stock shall (i) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of bridge preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed at the principal office of the corporation or transfer agent for the bridge preferred stock, if any, and (ii) notify the corporation in writing of the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of permanent preferred stock to be issued. in the case of lost or destroyed certificates formerly evidencing ownership of shares of bridge preferred stock to be surrendered, the holder shall submit such proof of loss or destruction and, if requested by the corporation, an appropriate indemnity, reasonably required by the corporation. the date on which the holder satisfies the foregoing requirements is referred to as the "delivery date." as soon as practicable after the delivery date, the ------------- corporation shall deliver or shall deliver through its transfer agent a certificate for the number of full shares of permanent preferred stock issuable upon such conversion. notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of whether a holder shall have surrendered such holder's certificates evidencing shares of bridge preferred stock and/or received in respect thereof certificates evidencing shares of permanent preferred stock, such holder shall from and after the automatic conversion date be treated for all purposes as a record holder of the number of shares of permanent preferred stock into which such holder's shares of bridge preferred stock shall have been converted and the certificate held by such holder formerly representing ownership of shares of bridge preferred stock shall, until surrendered in exchange for new certificates evidencing shares of permanent preferred stock as contemplated above, be deemed for all purposes to evidence the shares of permanent preferred stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of bridge preferred stock formerly held by such holder until such time as record ownership is transferred. all shares of permanent preferred stock issuable upon 14 conversion of the bridge preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. in the event that the automatic conversion date occurs after any record date but before the next succeeding dividend payment date, dividends that are payable on such dividend payment date in an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the dividend for the portion of the dividend period that such bridge preferred stock was outstanding shall be payable on such dividend payment date notwithstanding such conversion, and such dividends shall be paid to the person who was the holder of such bridge preferred stock on such record date (and shall not constitute "accrued and unpaid dividends" for purposes of paragraph 5(a)). (e) the corporation shall not issue a fractional share of common stock upon conversion of bridge preferred stock. instead, the corporation shall deliver a check for an amount equal to the value of the fractional share. the value of a fraction of a share is determined by multiplying the current market price of the common stock as of the optional conversion date by the fraction, rounded to the nearest cent. (f) a holder delivering bridge preferred stock for conversion will not be required to pay any taxes or duties in respect of the issue or delivery of common stock and mezzanine preferred stock or permanent preferred stock, as the case may be, on conversion but will be required to pay any tax or duty that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of the shares of common stock and mezzanine preferred stock or permanent preferred stock, as the case may be. certificates representing shares of common stock and mezzanine preferred stock or permanent preferred stock, as the case may be, will not be issued or delivered unless all taxes and duties, if any, payable by the holder have been paid. (g) the corporation has reserved and shall continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued common stock or its common stock held in treasury and its permanent preferred stock and mezzanine preferred stock enough shares of common stock and permanent preferred stock and mezzanine preferred stock to permit the conversion of the bridge preferred stock in full. all shares of common stock and permanent preferred stock and mezzanine preferred stock which may be issued upon conversion of bridge preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. the corporation will comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of common stock and permanent preferred stock and mezzanine preferred stock upon conversion of bridge preferred stock and will list the shares of common stock on each national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed. (h) if the corporation after the closing date: 15 (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its common stock; (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares; (iii) combines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) issues by reclassification of its common stock any shares of its capital stock; then the conversion price (as in effect immediately prior to such action) shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of bridge preferred stock thereafter converted pursuant to subparagraph 5(a) may receive for the same aggregate conversion price the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the corporation that he would have owned immediately following such action if he had converted bridge preferred stock immediately prior to such action. the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. if, after an adjustment referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above, a holder of bridge preferred stock upon conversion of it may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the corporation, the corporation shall determine the allocation of the conversion price between the classes of capital stock. after such allocation, the conversion rights and the conversion price with respect to each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to common stock in this subparagraph 5(h). (i) if at any time or from time to time after the initial issue date, the corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this subparagraph 5(i) to have issued or sold, additional shares of common stock, otherwise than in connection with a transaction described in subparagraph 5(h), for an effective price (as hereinafter defined) that is less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, the conversion price shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such issue or sale, to the effective price at which such additional shares of common stock are so issued or sold. notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this subparagraph 5(i) to the extent that such adjustment would constitute a material violation of the rules of the new york stock exchange. for the purpose of making any adjustment required under this subparagraph 5(i): "additional shares of common stock" shall mean all shares of common --------------------------------- stock issued by the corporation, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the corporation, other than (i) shares of common stock and shares of permanent preferred stock issued or issuable upon conversion of bridge preferred stock (including without limitation the issuance of any securities as part of any anti-dilution adjustment made with respect to any securities issued pursuant to the senior note purchase agreement), (ii) shares of common stock issuable upon 16 conversion of convertible securities outstanding as of the closing date or upon exercise of rights or options outstanding on the closing date, the issuance of warrants in lieu of the issuance of common stock pursuant to the senior note purchase agreement or the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of such warrants and (iii) shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the senior note purchase agreement (other than shares of common stock issued as part of any anti-dilution adjustment with respect to securities issued pursuant to the senior note purchase agreement). the "aggregate consideration received" by the corporation for any -------------------------------- issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (a) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the amount of cash received by the corporation in connection with such issuance or sale; (b) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that property; (c) if additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or rights or options to purchase either additional shares of common stock or convertible securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the corporation for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors to be allocable to such additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or rights or options; and (d) if additional shares of common stock are issued or sold in a public offering or private placement, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting therefrom any discounts, commissions or placement fees payable by the corporation to any underwriter or placement agent in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. "convertible securities" shall mean stock or other securities ---------------------- convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock; the "effective price" of additional shares of common stock shall mean --------------- the quotient determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received, or deemed to have been received, by the corporation under this subparagraph 5(i), for the issue of such additional shares of common stock by the total number of additional shares of common stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold, by the corporation under this subparagraph 5(i); and "rights or options" shall mean warrants, options or other rights to ----------------- purchase or acquire shares of common stock or convertible securities. for the purpose of making any adjustment to the conversion price required under this subparagraph 5(i), if after the initial issue date the corporation issues or sells any rights or options or convertible securities and if the effective price of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights or options and/or the conversion or exchange of convertible securities (computed without reference to any additional or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the conversion price, then the corporation shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the issuance of such rights, options or convertible securities, that number of additional shares of common stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of such rights, options or convertible securities upon their issuance and to have received, as the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such shares, an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, 17 received by the corporation for the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities, plus, in the case of such rights or options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the corporation upon the exercise in full of such rights or options, plus, in the case of convertible securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such convertible securities) upon the conversion or exchange thereof; provided that (i) if the -------- ---- minimum amounts of such consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the corporation shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses, and (ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the corporation upon the exercise of rights or options or the conversion or exchange of convertible securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the effective price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced. on any change ("pricing change") in the number of shares of common stock -------------- deliverable upon exercise of any rights or options or the conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or any change in the consideration to be received by the corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the conversion price as then in effect shall forthwith be readjusted to such conversion price as would have been obtained had the unexercised portion of such rights or options or convertible securities been originally issued with the exercise or conversion price in effect following such pricing change. on the expiration or cancellation of any rights or options that are unexercised, or the termination of the right to convert or exchange any such convertible securities, if the conversion price shall have been adjusted upon the issuance thereof, the conversion price shall forthwith be readjusted to such conversion price as would have been obtained had an adjustment been made upon the issuance of such rights or options or such convertible securities on the basis of the issuance of only the number of shares of common stock actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of common stock on the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of any such convertible securities. (j) in case of any consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the corporation with or into another person or any merger of another person with or into the corporation (other than a transaction to which paragraph 5(h) applies), or in case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation, each share of bridge preferred stock then outstanding shall, without the consent of the holder of any bridge preferred stock, become convertible only into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of common stock (and other securities, if applicable) into which such bridge preferred stock was convertible immediately prior thereto (assuming such holder of common stock (and other securities, if applicable) failed to exercise any rights of election and that such bridge preferred stock was then convertible). concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, the corporation formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger if other than the corporation, or the person to which such sale or conveyance shall have been made, shall enter into a supplemental agreement so 18 providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section. (k) for purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to a transaction described or contemplated by this paragraph 5, whenever this certificate of designation calls for the determination of "fair market value," such fair market value shall be determined in good faith by the board of directors as evidenced by a written resolution thereof, subject to the provisions of subparagraph 5(q) below; and: (l) no adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the conversion price. any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph (l) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this paragraph 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. (m) the corporation shall take no action that would cause any adjustment under this paragraph 5 that would reduce the conversion price below the par value of the common stock. (n) whenever the conversion price is adjusted, the corporation shall promptly mail to holders of bridge preferred stock, first class, postage prepaid, a notice of the adjustment and a certificate from the corporation's independent public accountants briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. subject to subparagraph 5(q) below, the certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. (o) after the required stockholder approval is obtained, the corporation from time to time may, by a vote of two-thirds of the board of directors reduce the conversion price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) business days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period, but in no event may the conversion price be less than the par value of a share of common stock. whenever the conversion price is so reduced, the corporation shall mail to holders of bridge preferred stock a notice of the reduction. the corporation shall mail the notice first class, postage prepaid, at least 20 days before the date the reduction in the conversion price is to take effect. the notice shall state the reduced conversion price and the period it will be in effect. a reduction of the conversion price pursuant to this subparagraph 5(o) does not change or adjust the conversion price otherwise in effect for purposes of subparagraph 5(h) above. (p) if: (i) the corporation takes any action that would require an adjustment in the conversion price pursuant to clause (iv) of subparagraph 5(h) above; (ii) the corporation consolidates or merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation, and stockholders of the corporation must approve the transaction; or (iii) there is a dissolution or liquidation of the corporation; 19 a holder of bridge preferred stock may want to convert such stock into shares of common stock and mezzanine preferred stock or permanent preferred stock, as the case may be, prior to the record date for or the effective date of such transaction. therefore, the corporation shall mail to such holders a notice, first class, postage prepaid, stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. the corporation shall mail such notice at least twenty (20) days before such date. (q) except as provided in the immediately following sentence, any determination that the corporation or its board of directors must make pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be conclusive. whenever the corporation or its board of directors shall be required to make a determination under this paragraph 5, such determination shall be made in good faith and may be challenged in good faith by the holders of a majority of the shares of bridge preferred stock then outstanding (with any shares held by the corporation or any of its affiliates not being considered to be outstanding for purposes of this certificate of designation), and any dispute shall be resolved, at the prevailing party's expense, by an investment banking firm of recognized national standing selected by the corporation and acceptable to such holders of a majority of the shares of bridge preferred stock. (r) all shares of bridge preferred stock converted pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series and may thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred stock other than bridge preferred stock. (s) the corporation shall not avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the corporation, but shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the bridge preferred stock against impairment. 6. redemption by the corporation. ----------------------------- (a) the corporation shall (subject to the legal availability of funds therefore) be required to redeem, at the option of the holders of the bridge preferred stock (exercised as provided in subparagraph 6(b)) all outstanding shares of the bridge preferred stock requested to be redeemed by such holders (as provided in subparagraph 6(b)), at the redemption price, on or at any time following the initial redemption date.

(e) any funds deposited with a bank or trust corporation for the purpose of redeeming bridge preferred stock shall be irrevocable except that: (i) the corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust corporation the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings; and (ii) any balance of monies so deposited by the corporation and unclaimed by the holders of the bridge preferred stock entitled thereto at the expiration of two (2) years from the applicable redemption date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings earned thereon, to the corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the corporation shall look only to the corporation for payment without interest or other earnings.

(g) all shares of bridge preferred stock redeemed pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series and may thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred stock other than shares of bridge preferred stock.

(d) so long as ten percent (10%) of the shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding on the initial issue date (after giving effect to the issuance of all shares of convertible preferred stock issued on the initial issue date) shall be outstanding, the corporation shall not declare, pay or set apart for payment on any junior stock any dividends whatsoever, whether in cash, property or otherwise (other than dividends payable in shares of the class or series upon which such dividends are declared or paid, or payable in shares of common stock with respect to junior stock other than common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares), nor shall the corporation make any distribution on any junior stock, nor shall any junior stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired by the corporation or any of its subsidiaries of which it owns not less than a majority of the outstanding voting power nor shall any monies be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the purchase or redemption of any junior stock, unless all dividends to which the holders of convertible preferred stock shall have been entitled for all previous 8 dividend periods shall have been paid or declared and a sum of money or pik dividends, as applicable (as provided in subparagraph 3(b)), sufficient for the payment thereof has been set apart. in addition, in the event that the corporation declares and/or pays any dividend or other distribution on the common stock (other than a dividend payable solely in shares of common stock), the corporation shall, at the time of such declaration and payment, declare and pay a dividend or other distribution on the convertible preferred stock consisting of the dividend or distribution that would have been payable on the shares of common stock had the convertible preferred stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution, or, if no such record was taken, the date as of which the record holders of common stock entitled to such dividend or distribution were determined. any dividend or distribution declared, or required to be declared or to be paid, on the convertible preferred stock shall be deemed to have "accrued" on the convertible preferred stock for all purposes of this paragraph 3 and shall remain an "accrued dividend" on the convertible preferred stock for all purposes of this section until paid. (e) in the event that full cash dividends are not paid or made available to the holders of all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock and of any parity stock on the applicable dividend payment date and funds available for payment of cash dividends shall be insufficient to permit payment in full to holders of all such stock of the full preferential amounts to which they are then entitled, then the entire amount available for payment of cash dividends shall be distributed ratably among all such holders of convertible preferred stock and of any parity stock in proportion to the full amount to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. 4. distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. --------------------------------------------------------- (a) in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the affairs of the corporation (in connection with the bankruptcy or insolvency of the corporation or otherwise), before any payment or distribution of the assets of the corporation (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of junior stock, the holders of convertible preferred stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the corporation in cash or property at its fair market value as determined by the board of directors of the corporation an amount per share equal to the liquidation preference plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of such liquidation or dissolution or such other winding up. (b) if, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the affairs of the corporation, the assets of the corporation shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full of the liquidation preference per share plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid on the convertible preferred stock and the full liquidating payments on all parity stock, then the assets of the corporation or the proceeds thereof shall be ratably distributed among the holders of convertible preferred stock and of any parity stock in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be entitled if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. (c) in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the affairs of the corporation upon completion of the distributions and payments required by subparagraph 4(a) and any other distributions and payments that may be 9 required with respect to any other series of preferred stock that may be authorized after the initial issue date, the remaining assets of the corporation shall be distributed among the holders of the then outstanding shares of common stock and convertible preferred stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of --- ---- common stock held by each such holder (where, for this purpose, the holders of the convertible preferred stock shall be deemed to hold the number of shares of common stock then issuable upon conversion in full of such shares of convertible preferred stock). (d) written notice of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, stating the payment date or dates when and the place where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days prior to any payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of the shares of convertible preferred stock at their address as the same shall appear in the records of the corporation. 5. conversion rights. ----------------- (a) a holder of shares of convertible preferred stock shall have the right, at such holder's option, to convert all or any portion of its shares of convertible preferred stock into common stock at any time before the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date (unless the corporation shall default in payment of the redemption price, in which case, the right of conversion shall be reinstated). for the purposes of conversion, each share of convertible preferred stock shall be valued at the liquidation preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon through the conversion date, which shall be divided by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date to determine the number of shares issuable upon conversion. immediately following such conversion, the rights of the holders of converted convertible preferred stock shall cease and the persons entitled to receive the common stock upon the conversion of convertible stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the owners of such common stock. (b) to convert convertible preferred stock, a holder must (i) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of convertible preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed at the principal office of the corporation or transfer agent for the convertible preferred stock, if any, (ii) notify the corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert convertible preferred stock, and the number of shares such holder wishes to convert, (iii) state in writing the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued, and (iv) pay any transfer or similar tax if required (provided, however, that no -------- ------- such payment shall be required if the common stock issuable upon conversion is to be issued in the name of the converting holder of convertible preferred stock). in the case of lost or destroyed certificates evidencing ownership of shares of convertible preferred stock to be surrendered for conversion, the holder shall submit such proof of loss or destruction and, if requested by the corporation, an appropriate indemnity, reasonably required by the corporation. in the event that a holder fails to notify the corporation of the number of shares of convertible preferred stock which such holder wishes to convert, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to convert all shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the date on which the holder satisfies all those requirements is the "conversion date." as soon as --------------- practicable after the conversion date, the corporation shall deliver or shall deliver through its 10 transfer agent a certificate for the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion, a check for any fractional share and a new certificate representing the unconverted portion, if any, of the shares of convertible preferred stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the person in whose name the common stock certificate is registered shall be treated as the stockholder of record on and after the conversion date until such time as record ownership is transferred. all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. in the case of convertible preferred stock that has been converted after any record date but before the next succeeding dividend payment date, dividends that are payable on such dividend payment date shall be payable on such dividend payment date in an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the dividend for the portion of the dividend period that such convertible preferred stock was outstanding, and such dividends shall be paid to the person who was the holder of such convertible preferred stock on such record date (and shall not constitute "accrued and unpaid dividends" for purposes of paragraph 5(a)). no other payment or adjustment for dividends, or for any dividends in respect of shares of common stock shall be made upon conversion. holders of common stock issued upon conversion shall not be entitled to receive any dividend payable to holders of common stock as of any record time before the close of business on the conversion date. if a holder of convertible preferred stock converts more than one share at a time the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be based on the total number of all shares of convertible preferred stock converted. (c) the corporation shall not issue a fractional share of common stock upon conversion of convertible preferred stock. instead, the corporation shall deliver a check for an amount equal to the value of the fractional share. the value of a fraction of a share is determined by multiplying the current market price of the common stock as of the conversion date by the fraction, rounded to the nearest cent. (d) a holder delivering convertible preferred stock for conversion will not be required to pay any taxes or duties in respect of the issue or delivery of common stock on conversion but will be required to pay any tax or duty that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of the shares of common stock. certificates representing shares of common stock will not be issued or delivered unless all taxes and duties, if any, payable by the holder have been paid. (e) the corporation has reserved and shall continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued common stock or its common stock held in treasury enough shares of common stock to permit the conversion of the convertible preferred stock in full. all shares of common stock which may be issued upon conversion of convertible preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. the corporation will comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of convertible preferred stock and will list such shares on each national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed. 11 (f) if the corporation, after the closing date: (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its common stock; (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares; (iii) combines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) issues by reclassification of its common stock any shares of its capital stock; then the conversion price (as in effect immediately prior to such action) shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of convertible preferred stock thereafter converted may receive for the same aggregate conversion price the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the corporation that such holder would have owned immediately following such action if such holder had converted convertible preferred stock immediately prior to such action. the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. if, after an adjustment referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above, a holder of convertible preferred stock upon conversion of it may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the corporation, the corporation shall determine the allocation of the conversion price between the classes of capital stock. after such allocation, the conversion rights and the conversion price with respect to each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to common stock in this subparagraph 5(f). (g) if at any time or from time to time after the closing date but on or before the first anniversary of the closing date, the corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this subparagraph 5(g) to have issued or sold, additional shares of common stock, otherwise than in connection with a transaction described in subparagraph 5(f), for an effective price (as hereinafter defined) that is less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, the conversion price shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such issue or sale, to the effective price at which such additional shares of common stock are so issued or sold. if, at any time or from time to time after the first anniversary of the closing date, the corporation issues or sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this subparagraph 5(g) to have issued or sold additional shares of common stock, otherwise than in connection with a transaction described in subparagraph 5(f), for an effective price that is less than the target price in effect prior to such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, the conversion price shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of such issue or sale, to the price obtained by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale of additional 12 shares of common stock plus (b) the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate consideration received (as hereinafter defined) by the company for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold) by the target price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale; and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (b) the number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold (or deemed so issued and sold). for the purpose of making any adjustment required under this subparagraph 5(g): "additional shares of common stock" shall mean all shares of common --------------------------------- stock issued by the corporation, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the company, other than (i) shares of common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock (including without limitation the issuance of any securities as part of any anti-dilution adjustment made with respect to any securities issued pursuant to the senior note purchase agreement), (ii) shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible securities outstanding as of the closing date or upon exercise of rights or options either outstanding on the closing date or pursuant to options described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of rights or options, and (iii) shares of capital stock issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the senior note purchase agreement (other than shares of common stock issued as part of any anti-dilution adjustment with respect to securities issued pursuant to the senior note). the "aggregate consideration received" by the corporation for any -------------------------------- issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (a) to the extent it consists of cash, be computed at the amount of cash received by the corporation in connection with such issuance or sale; (b) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair market value of that property; (c) if additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or rights or options to purchase either additional shares of common stock or convertible securities are issued or sold together with other stock or securities or other assets of the corporation for a consideration which covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that may be reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors to be allocable to such additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or rights or options; and (d) if additional shares of common stock are issued or sold in a public offering or private placement, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting therefrom any discounts, commissions or placement fees payable by the corporation to any underwriter or placement agent in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. "convertible securities" shall mean stock or other securities ---------------------- convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock. the "effective price" of additional shares of common stock shall mean --------------- the quotient determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received, or deemed to have been received, by the corporation under this subparagraph 5(g), for the issue of such additional 13 shares of common stock by the total number of additional shares of common stock issued or sold, or deemed to have been issued or sold, by the corporation under this subparagraph 5(g). "rights or options" shall mean warrants, options or other rights to ----------------- purchase or acquire shares of common stock or convertible securities, other than (i) options to purchase up to 100,000 shares of common stock (and the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such options) issued pursuant to the corporation's amended and restated 1998 directors stock plan, the corporation's 1998 stock incentive plan, the corporation's non-qualified stock option agreement, or the corporation's stock incentive plan to current employees of the corporation or its subsidiaries with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of one share of common stock on the date of grant, (ii) options to purchase up to 100,000 shares of common stock (and the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such options) issued pursuant to the corporation's amended and restated 1998 directors stock plan, the corporation's 1998 stock incentive plan, the corporation's non-qualified stock option agreement, or the corporation's stock incentive plan to employees of the corporation or its subsidiaries hired after the closing date with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the fair market value of one share of common stock on the date of grant and (iii) warrants issued in lieu of the issuance of common stock pursuant to the terms of the senior note purchase agreement. for the purpose of making any adjustment to the conversion price required under this subparagraph 5(g), if after the closing date, the corporation issues or sells any rights or options or convertible securities and if the effective price of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights or options and/or the conversion or exchange of convertible securities (computed without reference to any additional or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the conversion price, then the corporation shall be deemed to have issued, at the time of the issuance of such rights, options or convertible securities, that number of additional shares of common stock that is equal to the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of such rights, options or convertible securities upon their issuance and to have received, as the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such shares, an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the corporation for the issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities, plus, in the case of such rights or options, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the corporation upon the exercise in full of such rights or options, plus, in the case of convertible securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities or obligations evidenced by such convertible securities) upon the conversion or exchange thereof; provided that (i) if the minimum amounts of such consideration -------- ---- cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or similar protective clauses, then the corporation shall be deemed to have received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such clauses, and (ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the corporation upon the exercise of rights or options or the conversion or exchange of convertible securities is reduced over time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the effective price shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of consideration is reduced. on any change ("pricing change") in the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise of any rights or options or the conversion 14 or exchange of any convertible securities or any change in the consideration to be received by the corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the conversion price as then in effect shall forthwith be readjusted to such conversion price as would have been obtained had the unexercised portion of such rights or options or convertible securities been originally issued with the exercise or conversion price in effect following such pricing change. on the expiration or cancellation of any rights or options that are unexercised, or the termination of the right to convert or exchange any such convertible securities, if the conversion price shall have been adjusted upon the issuance thereof, the conversion price shall forthwith be readjusted to such conversion price as would have been obtained had an adjustment been made upon the issuance of such rights or options or such convertible securities on the basis of the issuance of only the number of shares of common stock actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of common stock on the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion or exchange of any such convertible securities. (h) in case of any consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the corporation with or into another person or any merger of another person with or into the corporation (other than a transaction to which paragraph 5(f) applies), or in case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation, each share of convertible preferred stock then outstanding shall, without the consent of the holder of any convertible preferred stock, become convertible only into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of common stock (and other securities, if applicable) into which such convertible preferred stock was convertible immediately prior thereto (assuming such holder of common stock (and other securities, if applicable) failed to exercise any rights of election and that such convertible preferred stock was then convertible). concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, the corporation formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger if other than the company, or the person to which such sale or conveyance shall have been made, shall enter into a supplemental agreement so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section. (i) for purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to a transaction described or contemplated by this paragraph 5, whenever this certificate of designation calls for the determination of "fair market value," such fair market value shall be determined in good faith by the board of directors as evidenced by a written resolution thereof, and subject to the provisions of subparagraph 5(o) below; and (j) no adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the conversion price. any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph 5(j) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this paragraph 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. 15 (k) the corporation shall take no action that would cause any adjustment under this paragraph 5 that would reduce the conversion price below the par value of the common stock. (l) whenever the conversion price is adjusted, the corporation shall promptly mail to holders of convertible preferred stock, first class, postage prepaid, a notice of the adjustment and a certificate from the corporation's independent public accountants briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. subject to subparagraph 5(o) below, the certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. (m) the corporation from time to time may, by a vote of two-thirds of the board of directors reduce the conversion price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) business days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period, but in no event may the conversion price be less than the par value of a share of common stock. whenever the conversion price is so reduced, the corporation shall mail to holders of convertible preferred stock a notice of the reduction. the corporation shall mail the notice first class, postage prepaid, at least 20 days before the date the reduction in the conversion price is to take effect. the notice shall state the reduced conversion price and the period it will be in effect. a reduction of the conversion price pursuant to this subparagraph 5(m) does not change or adjust the conversion price otherwise in effect for purposes of subparagraphs 5(f) and 5(g) above. (n) if: (i) the corporation takes any action that would require an adjustment in the conversion price pursuant to clause (iv) of subparagraph 5(f) above; (ii) the corporation consolidates or merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation, and stockholders of the corporation must approve the transaction; or (iii) there is a dissolution or liquidation of the corporation; a holder of convertible preferred stock may want to convert such stock into shares of common stock prior to the record date for or the effective date of such transaction. therefore, the corporation shall mail to such holders a notice, first class, postage prepaid, stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. the corporation shall mail such notice at least twenty (20) days before such date. (o) except as provided in the immediately following sentence, any determination that the corporation or its board of directors must make pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be conclusive. whenever the corporation or its board of directors shall be required to make a determination under this paragraph 5, such determination shall be made in good faith and may be challenged in good faith by the holders of a majority of the shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding (with any shares held by the corporation or any of its affiliates not being considered to be outstanding for purposes of this certificate of designation), and any dispute shall be resolved, at the prevailing party's expense, by an investment banking firm of recognized national 16 standing selected by the corporation and acceptable to such holders of a majority of the shares of convertible preferred stock. (p) all shares of convertible preferred stock converted pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series and may thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred stock other than convertible preferred stock. (q) the corporation shall not avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the company, but shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the convertible preferred stock against impairment. 6. redemption by the corporation. ----------------------------- (a) the corporation shall (subject to the legal availability of funds therefore) be required to redeem, at the redemption price, all outstanding shares of the convertible preferred stock on the redemption date. (b) notice of such redemption shall be sent by or on behalf of the corporation not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the redemption date, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of record of the convertible preferred stock at their respective last addresses as they shall appear on the books of the corporation; provided, however, that no -------- ------- failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall (i) relieve the corporation from its obligation to redeem the convertible preferred stock pursuant to this paragraph 6 or (ii) affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of convertible preferred stock; provided that the corporation shall be obligated in accordance with this paragraph 6 to redeem shares of convertible preferred stock held by any holder to whom the corporation has failed to give notice or as to whom notice was defective. in addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which convertible preferred stock may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the place or places in the united states where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (iv) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date; (v) the conversion price; (vi) that convertible preferred stock called for redemption may be converted at any time before the close of business on the redemption date; and (vii) that holders of convertible preferred stock must satisfy the requirements of paragraph 5 above if such holders desire to convert such shares. (c) on or prior to each redemption date, the corporation shall deposit the redemption price for all shares of convertible preferred stock not yet redeemed or converted with a bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective holders of the convertible preferred stock, with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust corporation to publish the notice of redemption thereof and pay the redemption price for such shares to their respective holders on or 17 after the redemption date, upon receipt of notification from the corporation that such holder has surrendered his, her or its share certificate to the corporation pursuant to subparagraph 6(b) above. (d) if notice has been mailed in accordance with subparagraph 6(b) above and provided that, on or before the redemption date, all funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside by the corporation, separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the convertible preferred stock, so as to be, and to continue to be available therefor, then, from and after the redemption date, dividends on the shares of the convertible preferred stock shall cease to accrue, and said shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and shall not have the status of shares of convertible preferred stock, and all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of the corporation (except the right to receive from the corporation the redemption price) shall cease. upon surrender, in accordance with said notice, of the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the corporation at the redemption price. (e) any funds deposited with a bank or trust corporation for the purpose of redeeming convertible preferred stock shall be irrevocable except that: (i) the corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust corporation the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings; and (ii) any balance of monies so deposited by the corporation and unclaimed by the holders of the convertible preferred stock entitled thereto at the expiration of two (2) years from the applicable redemption date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings earned thereon, to the corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the corporation shall look only to the corporation for payment without interest or other earnings.

(b) no inconsistent agreements the company shall not on or after the date of this agreement enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of registrable securities in this agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. except for the other registration rights agreement, the company has not previously entered into any agreement with respect to its securities granting any registration rights to any person. the rights granted to the holders of registrable securities hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the company's securities under any such agreements.
