--------------------------- --------------------------- 62949w103 page 15 of 24 - --------------------------- --------------------------- certain of its stockholders to participate in such registered offering, then the ga signatories will have the right to participate in the registered offering on a pro rata basis with the other stockholders of the company participating in such registered offering. in addition, if the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act at any time following the closing date but prior to the expiration of the transfer restrictions described above in respect of an offering to be made for the account of entities affiliated with the goldman sachs group, inc., consisting of gs archipelago investment, l.l.c., slk-hull derivatives llc and goldman sachs execution and clearing, l.p., or any holder of the common stock who was a member of the nyse immediately prior to the mergers described above, then the ga signatories will also have the right to participate in such registered offering on a pro rata basis with the other stockholders of the company participating in such registered offering. if the ga signatories have not had the right to participate in at least one offering on or prior to the first anniversary of the closing date, then the ga signatories shall have the right (a "registration right"), exercisable once during the period between the first and second anniversaries of the closing date, to demand that the company effect the registration under the securities act of all or any portion of the common stock held by the ga signatories that are then no longer subject to the restrictions on transfer described above. if the ga signatories have not had the right to participate in at least two offerings on or prior to the second anniversary of the closing date, then the ga signatories shall have a registration right, exercisable once during the period between the second and third anniversaries of the closing date, to demand that the company effect the registration under the securities act of all or any portion of the common stock held by the ga signatories that are then no longer subject to the restrictions on transfer described above. -

--------------------------- --------------------------- 62949w103 page 17 of 24 - --------------------------- --------------------------- based on the number of shares of the common stock being sold by or on behalf of the ga signatories in the offering). the company will be liable for all other registration-related expenses of such offering, other than the underwriter's discounts and commissions related to the shares of the common stock sold by or on behalf of the ga signatories in such offering, which discounts and commissions will be the responsibility of the ga signatories. if any of the company's stockholders participate in a registered offering with the ga signatories, the company may require such stockholders to pay for their portion of some or all of the expenses of such offering (with such portion based on the number of shares of the common stock being sold by or on behalf of such stockholders in the offering). if the company imposes this requirement, the ga signatories will be liable for their portion of the same registration expenses (with such portion based on the number of shares of the common stock being sold by or on behalf of the ga signatories in the offering). the ga signatories also have the right to participate in certain registered offerings of the common stock to the extent that such persons continue to hold the common stock subject to the transfer restrictions imposed by the support agreement. specifically, if the company proposes an offering of the common stock for its own account and decides to permit certain of its stockholders to participate in that registered offering, then the ga signatories will also be entitled to participate in that registered offering pro rata with the other stockholders that are participating in the offering. moreover, if the company agrees to register an offering of the common stock for any stockholder who was a nyse member immediately prior to the mergers contemplated by the merger agreement, then the ga signatories will be entitled to participate in that offering on equal terms and pro rata with the other stockholders participating in the -
