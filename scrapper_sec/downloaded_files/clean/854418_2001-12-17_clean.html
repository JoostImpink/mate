however, pursuant to a guarantee and promise to pay in favor of each of mr. mcgettigan and ms. clark, respectively (the &#147;guarantees&#148;), arthur l. allen, the sole stockholder of asg, has guaranteed payment within five years of closing of all amounts due to be paid to mr. mcgettigan and ms. clark pursuant to the purchase agreements, and has guaranteed certain specified minimum annual amounts. the guarantees from mr. allen are also unsecured, although mr. allen has agreed to make efforts to pledge 5,000,000 shares of common stock of e-security, inc. owned by him as personal security for the guarantee to mr. mcgettigan. mr. mcgettigan and ms. clark have also agreed to vote all their shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock to approve the merger agreement and the merger. in addition, they have executed and delivered to arthur l. allen and certain other affiliates of asg irrevocable proxies (the &#147;proxies&#148;) in respect of the shares owned by them which entitles mr. allen and/or the other asg affiliates to vote their shares (i) to approve the merger agreement and the merger, (ii) in favor of any matter which would likely facilitate the merger, (iii) against approval of any proposal relating to the acquisition of 10% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock, other than as contemplated by the merger agreement and (iv) against any proposal or action which could prohibit or discourage the merger at any meeting of the issuer&#146;s stockholders. the merger is also subject to other conditions, including performance by the parties to the merger agreement of all material covenants and obligations required to be performed at or prior to the effective time of the merger. an aggregate of approximately $26,344,000, plus interest on the unpaid balance due, will be required for the purchase of the shares of the issuer owned by mr. mcgettigan and ms. clark. these funds are expected to come from asg&#146;s and the issuer&#146;s cash flows from operations following the merger of asg sub into the issuer. in addition, an aggregate of approximately $33,000,000, exclusive of payments by the issuer for outstanding stock options and other expenses relating to the merger, will be required to pay for the shares of the issuer which are to be acquired in the merger from all of the shareholders of the issuer other than mr. mcgettigan and ms. clark. approximately $25.5 million of these funds are expected to come from the issuer&#146;s cash balances at the effective time of the merger and the balance of the funds required are expected to come from asg&#146;s cash balances at the effective time of the merger. it is not anticipated that asg will be required to borrow any of the consideration necessary to effect either the purchase of the shares from mr. mcgettigan and ms. clark or the merger. 4 in the merger, each outstanding share of common stock that is owned by asg, asg sub or the issuer will be cancelled, and each outstanding share of common stock that is not owned by asg, asg sub or the issuer will be converted into the right to receive $4.75 in cash, without interest, and the issuer will become a wholly owned subsidiary of asg (the &#147;surviving corporation&#148;). item 4. purpose of transaction.

b. concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement, asg, asg sub, and landmark have entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") pursuant to which asg sub and landmark will be merged, and each share that is (i) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) not owned by asg, asg sub or landmark will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration; and c. in order to induce asg and asg sub to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger, principal shareholder has agreed to execute and deliver to asg this agreement, pursuant to which principal shareholder has agreed to (i) sell, exchange and deliver to asg, immediately prior to the conversion of the shares pursuant to the merger agreement, the principal shares in return for (a) the share consideration as defined herein and (b) a guarantee by arthur l. allen (the "guarantor") of all amounts due to principal shareholder under this agreement pursuant to that certain guarantee and promise to pay (the "guarantee") attached hereto as exhibit a (the "sale"), (ii) grant asg or asg sub an irrevocable proxy with respect to the issued and outstanding principal shares, and (iii) make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the sale. therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein set forth, in consideration of asg and asg sub entering into the merger agreement and in consideration of guarantor entering into the guarantee, the parties agree as follows: 1. purchase and sale of principal shares (a) sale. subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, at the share purchase closing referred to in section 1(d) hereof, principal shareholder shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver the principal shares to asg free and clear of all liens.

(ii) the principal shareholder shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by the principal shareholder of the payment statement and the payment (the "notice period") to notify asg of her election to accept or reject (and in the case of a rejection, there shall be included in such notice the reasons for such rejection in reasonable detail) the payment statement. in the event no notice is received by asg during the notice period, the payment statement shall be deemed accepted by the principal shareholder and final and binding on the parties hereto. in the event that the principal shareholder shall timely reject the payment statement, asg and the principal shareholder shall attempt to make a joint determination of the landmark product line cash receipts for the statement period and such determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto.

(b) guarantor hereby guarantees that the cumulative amounts of contingent payments made to clark for year 1 (due on the earlier of (i) 30 days after the first anniversary of the effective time and (ii) march 15, 2003) shall be a minimum of $3,799,258.98; for year 2 (due within 30 days after the end of year 2) shall be a minimum of $2,272,105.86 (for a total aggregate amount due by the end of such 30 days of $6,071,364.84); for year 3 (due within 30 days after the end of year 3) shall be a minimum of $782,200.38 (for a total aggregate amount due by the end of such 30 days of $6,853,565.22); and for year 4 (due within 30 days after the end of year 4) shall be a minimum of $782,200.38 (for a total aggregate amount due by the end of such 30 days of $7,635,765.60) (collectively the "yearly minimum commitments"). if the total contingent payments made by asg by the due dates specified in the preceding sentence are less than the aggregate yearly minimum commitments due by such time, then the guarantor shall pay the shortfall in such amount to clark within ten (10) business days after the due date specified in the preceding sentence. for purposes hereof, year 1 shall mean the period beginning at the effective time and ending on the earlier of the first anniversary thereof and march 15, 2003. year 2 shall mean the period beginning on the date on which the payment in respect of year 1 is made and ending on the second anniversary of the effective time. years 3, 4 and 5 shall follow accordingly. year 1, year 2, year 3, year 4 and year 5 are each referred to herein as a "year". all payments by the guarantor hereunder shall be treated as having been paid as share consideration (as such term is defined in the clark principal share purchase and voting agreement), on behalf of asg incurred in connection with asg's purchase of the clark shares under the clark principal share purchase and voting agreement. such payments shall be treated consistently by the parties for income tax purposes as paid -5- by the guarantor on behalf of asg as a contribution to the capital of asg by the guarantor and received by clark as a payment by asg of clark contingent payments. for the avoidance of doubt, yearly minimum commitments shall not be due for any year if guarantor or asg has paid in full the total contingent consideration prior to the end of any such year.

(f) the guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to clark on account of its liability hereunder, it will notify clark in writing that such payment is made under this guarantee for such purpose.

waiver of rights. the guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that any demand for payment of any of the obligations made by clark may be rescinded by such party and any of the obligations continued, and the obligations, or the liability of any other party -8- upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by clark, the transaction agreements may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in accordance with the terms thereof, and any collateral security or guarantee at any time held by clark for the payment of the obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. when making any demand hereunder against the guarantor, clark may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on asg, and any failure by clark to make any such demand or to collect any payments from asg or any release of asg shall not relieve the guarantor in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or the guarantor not so released of its several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of clark against the guarantor. for the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings. 5. guarantee absolute and unconditional. the guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by clark upon this guarantee or acceptance of this guarantee;
