terms and conditions, to vote all shares of common stock currently owned or subsequently acquired by them (the "shares") (i) in favor of the approval and adoption of the agreement and plan of merger among parent, sub and the company dated as of june 24, 1997 (the "merger agreement") and the merger; (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any respect of any covenant, representation, or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the company under the merger agreement or the stockholders agreement; and (iii) except as agreed to in writing in advance by parent, against the following actions (other than the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement): (a) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the company or its subsidiaries; (b) a sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or its subsidiaries, or a reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of the company or its subsidiaries; (c)(1) any change in a majority of the persons who constitute the board of directors of the company; (2) any change in the present capitalization of the company or any amendment of the company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (3) any other material change in the company's corporate structure or business; or (4) any other

materially adversely affect the merger and the transactions contemplated by the stockholders agreement and the merger agreement. during the term of the stockholders agreement, the stockholders shall not enter into any agreement or understanding with any person or entity the effect of which would be inconsistent or violative of the above provisions and agreements. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, each stockholder has granted to parent a proxy to vote the shares of such stockholder. each stockholder intends such proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest and will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of the proxy and revoke any proxy previously granted by such stockholder with respect to such shares. pursuant to the stockholders agreement each stockholder shall vote his shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger and the merger agreement (and parent shall be entitled to exercise the proxy granted to parent as described in the previous paragraph to so vote) if, but only if, a majority of the issued and outstanding company common stock (that is not subject to the stockholders agreement) that is represented in person or by proxy at any meeting of the holders of company common stock shall have voted to approve and adopt the merger and the merger agreement. in any other event a stockholder shall abstain with respect to the approval and adoption of the merger and merger agreement. this provision of the stockholders agreement is for the benefit of, and may not be amended or waived without the written approval of, the company. each of the stockholders has also granted to parent an irrevocable option (each, a "purchase option" and collectively, the "purchase options") to purchase the shares owned or which may be acquired by the stockholders pursuant to the options (including any additional shares that may be issuable as a result of a "change of control") owned by such stockholder as a result of the stockholder's exercise of the option at a purchase price per share equal to the merger consideration (the "purchase price"). if the merger agreement is terminated in a manner which results in the company being obligated to pay certain fees and reimbursements under section 6.4 of the merger agreement (a "trigger 13 14 termination"), the purchase options shall become exercisable, in whole but not in part, upon the date of such termination and remain exercisable in whole but not in part until the date which is 60 days (or 120 days if, as of the date of such termination, no "change of control" shall have occurred under the terms of the various agreements governing the options) after the date of the occurrence of such termination (the "option period"), so long as: (i) all waiting periods under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, required for the purchase of the option shares upon such exercise shall have expired or been waived, and (ii) there shall not be in effect any preliminary or final injunction or other order issued by any court or governmental, administrative or regulatory agency or authority prohibiting the exercise of the purchase options pursuant to the stockholders agreement. in the event that parent wishes to exercise the purchase options, parent shall send a written notice (the "notice") to the stockholders identifying the place and date (not less than two nor more than 20 business days from the date of the notice) for the closing of such purchase. upon receipt of the notice to the extent not previously exercised, prior to or contemporaneously with the closing of the purchase of the option shares, each stockholder shall exercise in full the options. in the event that parent has purchased the option shares pursuant to the purchase option and, within 180 days after the closing of such purchase, sells, transfers or disposes of any of the option shares in a transaction with a non-affiliate of parent (a "disposition") then, within two business days after the closing of such disposition, parent shall tender and pay to each stockholder, in immediately available funds, their respective pro-rata share (calculated based on the respective amount of the option shares purchased from each stockholder pursuant to the purchase option) of 25% of the net profit realized by parent in connection with such disposition. as used herein, net profit shall mean an amount equal to (a) the excess, if any, of the gross amount realized by parent from a disposition over the purchase price paid with respect to the option shares subject to such disposition, minus the sum of (b) all reasonable out-of- pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by parent and its affiliates in connection with such disposition, (including, without limitation, all fees, costs and expenses of counsel) which in no event shall exceed 1% of such net profit, and (c) all customary brokerage fees and commissions, if any, incurred in connection with such disposition. pursuant to a financial advisory agreement dated november 27, 1996 an affiliate of fund iii will receive an advisory fee of 1.5% of the "transaction value." the term "transaction value" means the total value of the transaction, including without limitation, the aggregate amount of the funds required to complete the transaction (excluding any fees payable pursuant to the financial advisory agreement), including the amount of any indebtedness, preferred stock or similar items assumed (or remaining outstanding). item 7.

chase manhattan bank 270 park avenue new york, new york 10017 june 23, 1997 commitment letter atrium corporation atrium companies, inc. 1341 west mockingbird lane suite 1200 west dallas, texas 75247 attention: randall fojtasek, president and chief executive officer ladies and gentlemen: you have advised chase securities inc. ("csi") and the chase manhattan bank ("chase") that atrium corporation, a delaware corporation ("holdings"), acting through two newly formed wholly-owned delaware corporations ("acquisitionco a" and "acquisitionco b"), proposes to acquire, for a purchase price not exceeding $262,000,000 (which represents $18.75 per share), all of the outstanding common stock of ply gem industries, inc., a delaware corporation (the "acquired company"). acquisitionco a will be a direct subsidiary of holdings and acquisitionco b will be a direct subsidiary of acquisitionco a. in conjunction therewith (i) acquisitionco b will cause to be cashed out and cancelled all outstanding options to purchase capital stock of the acquired company (other than options held by dana snyder which will be exchanged for options to acquire common stock of holdings) 2 2 for an aggregate consideration not exceeding $35,000,000 (which represents $18.75 per share) net of option proceeds, (ii) acquisitionco b and the acquired company will be merged, with the acquired company as the surviving corporation (the "acquired company merger"), (iii) the acquired company will terminate or modify or cause to be terminated or modified on satisfactory terms certain existing contractual obligations between the acquired company and certain of its shareholders for an aggregate consideration not exceeding $24,600,000 and (iv) holdings will repay in full and cause to be repaid in full substantially all of the outstanding indebtedness of holdings, the acquired company and their respective subsidiaries (other than certain industrial development bond obligations and capital lease obligations in the aggregate amount of $20,000,000 and the currently outstanding senior subordinated notes of the borrower referred to below), the amount of indebtedness to be repaid currently estimated to be approximately $166,700,000, and cause the acquired company's accounts receivable facility to be liquidated. after giving effect to the acquired company merger, all of the capital stock of acquisitionco a will be contributed to atrium companies, inc., a delaware corporation (the "borrower") which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of holdings, and acquisitionco a and the borrower will be merged, with the borrower as the surviving corporation (the "borrower merger"; together with the acquired company merger, the "mergers"). the foregoing transactions are collectively referred to herein as the "acquisition". upon completion of the acquisition, all of the capital stock of the acquired company will be directly owned by the borrower, and all of the capital stock of the borrower will continue to be owned by holdings. the date on which the acquisition is consummated is referred to as the "closing date". you have also advised us that you propose to finance the acquisition and the related fees and expenses from the following sources: (a) up to $425,000,000 of senior secured credit facilities (the "credit facilities") of the borrower comprised of four term loan facilities aggregating not more than $325,000,000 (the "term loan facilities") and a $100,000,000 revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility") (with up to $50,000,000, less the aggregate amount of the acquired company's industrial development bond obligations and capital lease obligations which remain outstanding at closing, of the revolving credit facility being drawn at closing) and (b) $140,000,000 in cash equity proceeds from funds managed by hicks muse, tate & furst incorporated ("hmt&f") and other persons satisfactory to us from the sale of additional non-voting common stock of holdings, the proceeds of which will be contributed to the capital of the borrower. a portion of the revolving credit facility would also be used to finance the continuing operations of the borrower and its subsidiaries. csi is pleased to advise you that it is willing to act as exclusive advisor and arranger for the credit facilities. furthermore, chase is pleased to advise you of its commitment to provide to the borrower the entire amount of the credit facilities and to act as exclusive administrative, collateral, syndication and documentation agent in respect thereof. attached hereto as exhibit a is a summary of terms and conditions (the "term sheet") setting forth the principal terms and conditions on and subject to which chase is committed to make available the credit facilities. you have informed us that the borrower intends to issue up to $250,000,000 of its senior subordinated notes (the "senior subordinated notes") to finance the acquisition. in the event all or any of the senior subordinated notes are issued, the aggregate amount of the credit facilities will be 3 3 reduced by the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes, in the following order: first, to the tranche c term loan facility and the tranche d term loan facility, with the allocation of the reduction of such term loan facilities to be satisfactory to the lenders, second, to reduce the amount of revolving credit loans (but not the commitments under the revolving credit facility) which would otherwise be made on the closing date and third, to the tranche a term loan facility and the tranche b term loan facility, with the allocation of the reduction of such term loan facilities to be satisfactory to the lenders. the senior subordinated notes will have terms satisfactory to the lenders. you have advised us that csi will act as exclusive manager, and has the right to act as exclusive manager, for at least $175,000,000 of the senior subordinated notes to be issued at closing, the proceeds of which will be used to repay or replace the tranche c term loan and the tranche d term loan. as consideration for
