(b) an extraordinary corporate transac- tion, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or any of its subsid- iaries; (d) any change in the board of directors or management of the issuer, including any plan or proposal to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (f) any other material change in the issuer's business or corporate structure; (g) any change in the issuer's certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person;

(a) each holder shall have the right until 5:00 p.m., calgary time, on ______________, 1998 (the "expiration date") to purchase from the company the number of fully paid and non-assessable warrant shares that the holder may at the time be entitled to purchase on exercise of such warrants at the warrant price. after the expiration date, any previously unexercised warrants shall be void, have no value and be of no further effect. 3.2 exercise of warrants. a warrant may be exercised upon surrender to the company in care of the secretary of the company, of the warrant to be exercised, together with the duly completed and signed form of election to purchase attached hereto, and upon payment to the company of the warrant price for the number of warrant shares in respect of which such warrant is then exercised. payment of the aggregate warrant price shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with written wire transfer instructions to be provided by the company. subject to section 8, upon such surrender of the warrant and payment of the warrant price as aforesaid, the company shall issue and cause to be delivered with all reasonable dispatch to or upon the written order of the holder and in such name or names as the holder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the number of full warrant shares so purchased upon the exercise of such warrants, together with cash, as provided in section 8, in respect of any fractional warrant share otherwise issuable upon such surrender. such certificates or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such warrant shares as of the date of the surrender of such warrants and payment of the warrant price; provided, however, that if, at the date of surrender of such warrant and payment of such warrant price, the transfer books for the warrant shares or other class of stock purchasable upon the exercise of such warrant shall be closed, the certificates for the warrant shares in respect of which such warrant is then exercised shall be issuable as of the date on which such books shall next be opened (whether before or after the expiration date) and until such date the company shall be under no duty to deliver any certificate for such warrant shares; provided, further that the transfer books, unless otherwise required by law, shall not be closed at any one time for a period longer than 20 days. the rights of purchase represented by the warrant shall be exercisable, at the election of the holders thereof, either in full or from time to time in part. if a warrant is exercised in respect of less than all of the warrant shares purchasable on such exercise at any time prior to the expiration date, a new warrant evidencing the remaining warrant shares will be issued, and the company shall deliver the new warrant pursuant to the provisions of this section. section 4. payment of taxes, legend. 4.1 payment of taxes. the company will pay all documentary stamp taxes, if any, attributable to the initial issuance of warrant shares upon the exercise of the warrant; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of any warrant or certificates for warrant shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of such warrant in respect of which such warrant shares are initially issued, and the company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid. 4.2 legends. (a) each certificate for warrant shares and any certificate issued in exchange therefor or on conversion or upon transfer, except certificates issued in connection with a resale qualified for distribution pursuant to a prospectus, and except as provided below, shall bear such legend as may be required by the securities act (alberta), the bylaws of the alberta stock exchange or other applicable regulatory authorities. (b) the legends referred to in section 4.2(a) shall be removed by delivery of one or more substitute certificates without such legend if the holder thereof shall have delivered to the company a copy of an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company, to the effect that the legend is not required for purposes of the securities act (alberta), the bylaws of the alberta stock exchange or other applicable regulatory authorities. section 5. mutilated or missing warrants. if any warrant shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the company shall issue and deliver in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated warrant, or in lieu of and substitution for the warrant lost, stolen or destroyed, a new warrant of like tenor and representing an equivalent right or interest; but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it. an applicant for such a substitute warrant shall also comply with such other reasonable requirements and pay such other reasonable charges as the company may prescribe. section 6. reservation of warrant shares; purchase of warrants. 6.1 reservation of warrant shares. there have been reserved, and the company shall at all times keep reserved, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized common shares, the number of shares of common shares sufficient to provide for the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the outstanding warrants. the transfer agent and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of purchase will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. the company will keep a copy of each warrant on file with every transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the warrants. each transfer agent for the common shares is hereby irrevocably authorized to cause to be issued from time to time the stock certificates required to honour outstanding warrants upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof. the company will supply such transfer agent with duly executed stock certificates for such purpose and will provide or otherwise make available any cash which may be payable as provided in section 8 thereof. all warrants surrendered in the exercise of the rights thereby evidenced shall be cancelled by the company and retired. promptly after the expiration date, the secretary of the company shall certify to the company the aggregate number of warrants then outstanding, and thereafter no common shares shall be subject to reservation in respect of such warrants. the company covenants that all shares issued upon exercise of the warrants will, upon issuance in accordance with the terms hereof, be fully paid and non-assessable and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests created by the company with respect to the issuance thereof. 6.2 purchase of warrants by the company. the company shall have the right, except as limited by law, other agreements or herein, to purchase or otherwise acquire warrants at such times, in such manner and for such consideration as it may deem appropriate. 6.3 cancellation of warrants. if the company shall purchase or otherwise acquire warrants, the same shall thereupon be cancelled by the company and retired. the company shall cancel any warrant surrendered for exchange, substitution, transfer or exercise in whole or in part. section 7. adjustment of warrant price and number of warrant shares. the number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant and the warrant price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the happening of certain events, as hereinafter described. 7.1 mechanical adjustments. the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant and the warrant price payable in connection therewith shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (a) if the company shall at any time pay a dividend on its common shares in its common shares, subdivide its outstanding shares of common shares into a larger number of shares or combine its outstanding common shares into a smaller number of shares, the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that this warrant shall thereafter be exercisable for the number of warrant shares equal to the number of common shares which the holder would have held after the happening of any of the events described above had this warrant been exercised in full immediately prior to the happening of such event. an adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall become effective retroactively to the record date in the case of a dividend and shall become effective on the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. (b) if the company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of common shares for the purpose of entitling them (for a period not exceeding forty-five (45) days from the date of issuance) to subscribe for or purchase common shares at a price per share (taking into account any consideration received by the company for such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the board of directors) less than the average market price per share (determined as provided below) of the common shares on the declaration date for such issuance, then in each such case, the number of warrant shares thereafter issuable upon exercise of this warrant after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant on the date immediately preceding such declaration date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of common shares outstanding on such declaration date and the number of additional common shares so offered for subscription or purchase in connection with such rights or warrants, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of common shares outstanding on such declaration date and the number of common shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such average market price; provided, however, if all the common shares offered for subscription or purchase are not delivered upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, upon the exercise of such rights or warrants the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall thereafter be readjusted to the number of warrant shares which would have been in effect had the numerator and the denominator of the foregoing fraction and the resulting adjustment been made based upon the number of common shares actually delivered upon the exercise of such rights or warrants rather than upon the number of common shares offered for subscription or purchase. such adjustment shall be made whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective on the date of issuance retroactive to the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. (c) if the company shall distribute to all the holders of common shares (i) any rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security of the company (other than those referred to in paragraph (b) above) or any evidence of indebtedness or other securities of the company (other than common shares), or (ii) assets (other than cash) having a fair market value (as determined in a resolution adopted by the board of directors of the company, which shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value) in an amount during any 12-month period equal to more than 10% of the market capitalization (as defined below) of the company, then in each such case the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be, after the record date for determination of the shareholders entitled to receive such distribution, determined by multiplying the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant on the day immediately preceding the date of declaration or authorization by the board of directors of the company of such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the average market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (e) below) of the common shares on such declaration date, and the denominator of which shall be such average market price per share less the then fair market value (as determined by the board of directors of the company as provided above) of the portion of the assets, rights, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or other securities so distributed applicable to one common share. such adjustment shall become effective retroactively immediately after the declaration date. the term "market capitalization" shall mean an amount determined by multiplying the number of common shares outstanding on such declaration date by the average market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (e) below) of the common shares on such declaration date. (d) in case of any capital reorganization or any reclassification of the capital stock of the company, or of any exchange or conversion of the common shares for or into securities of another corporation, or in case of the amalgamation or merger of the company with or into any other person (other than an amalgamation or merger which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding common shares) or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the company, the person formed by such amalgamation or resulting from such capital reorganization, reclassification or merger or which acquires such assets, as the case may be, shall make provision such that this warrant shall thereafter be exercisable for the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, cash and other property receivable upon such capital reorganization, reclassification of capital stock, amalgamation, merger, sale or conveyance, as the case may be, by a holder of the shares of common shares equal to the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to the effective date of such capital reorganization, reclassification of capital stock, amalgamation, merger, sale or conveyance, assuming (i) such holder of common shares of the company is not a person with which the company amalgamated or into which the company merged or which merged into the company or to which such sale or transfer was made as the case may be ("constituent entity"), or an affiliate of a constituent entity, and (ii) such person failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such capital reorganization, reclassification of capital stock, amalgamation, merger, sale or conveyance and, in any case appropriate adjustment (as determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to rights and interests thereafter of the holder, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including the specified changes in and other adjustments of the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant) shall thereafter be applicable, as near as reasonably may be, in relating to any shares of stock or other securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon exercise of this warrant. (e) for the purpose of any computation under this section 7, the average market price per share of common shares on any date shall be the weighted average trading price at which common shares traded on the alberta stock exchange, or if the common shares are not then listed on the alberta stock exchange, on such stock exchange on which such shares are listed as may be selected by the board of directors of the company, for the fifteen (15) consecutive trading days commencing twenty (20) trading days before the date of declaration or authorization by the board of directors of the company of such issuance or distribution. the weighted average price of common shares for any period shall be determined by dividing the aggregate sales price of all common shares sold during the period by the total number of common shares so sold during such period or, if no such prices are available, the fair market value of the common shares as determined by good faith action of the board of directors of the company. (f) all calculations under this section 7 shall be made to the nearest one-thousandth of a common share. (g) whenever the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant is adjusted as herein provided, the warrant price payable upon exercise of this warrant shall be adjusted by multiplying such warrant price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number of warrant shares so purchasable immediately thereafter. (h) in case of any amalgamation or merger of the company with or into another entity (whether or not the company is the surviving entity) or in case of any sale, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the company, the company or such successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, shall execute with the holder an agreement that the holder shall have the right thereafter upon payment of the warrant price in effect immediately prior to such action to purchase upon exercise of this warrant the kind and amount of shares and other securities, cash and property that the holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive after the happening of such amalgamation, merger, sale, transfer, lease or conveyance had this warrant been exercised in full immediately prior to such action, and if the successor or purchasing entity is not a corporation, such person shall provide appropriate tax indemnification with respect to such shares or other securities and property so that upon exercise of this warrant, the holder would have the same benefits it otherwise would have had if such success, or purchasing person were a corporation. such agreement shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in sections 7(a) through 7(h), inclusive. the provisions of this section 7(h) shall similarly apply to successive amalgamations, mergers, sales or conveyances. (i) for the purpose of this section 7, the term "common shares" shall mean the class of shares designated as the common shares of the company at the date of this warrant and for purposes of determining the number of common shares outstanding at any time all non-voting shares shall be deemed to have been converted into common shares. in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (a) through (d) above, the holder shall become entitled to receive any shares of the company other than shares of common shares, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of this warrant and the warrant price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the warrant shares contained in paragraphs (a) through (h), inclusive, above, and the provisions of subsections 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5, inclusive, with respect to the warrant shares, shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. (j) upon the expiration of any rights, options, warrants or exercise or exchange privileges the issuance of which shall have resulted in an adjustment of the warrant price, if any thereof shall not have been exercised, the warrant price shall, upon such expiration, be readjusted and shall thereafter be such as it would have been had it been originally adjusted (or had the original adjustment not been required, as the case may be) as if (1) the only common shares so issued were the common shares, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such rights, options, warrants, exchange privileges or exercise rights and (2) common shares, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the company upon such exercise plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the company for the issuance, sale or grant of all of such rights, options, warrants or exercise rights whether or not exercised; provided that no such readjustment shall have the effect of increasing the warrant price or decreasing the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant by an amount in excess of the amount of the adjustment initially made in respect to the issuance, sale or grant of such rights, options, warrants or exercise rights. 7.2 time of adjustments. each adjustment required by section 7 shall be effective as and when the event requiring such adjustment occurs. 7.3 notice of adjustment. whenever the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant or the warrant price is adjusted as herein provided, the company shall promptly mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, each holder certificate of a firm of independent chartered accountants selected by the board of directors of the company (who may be the regular accountants employed by the company) setting forth the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant and the warrant price after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made. such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment. 7.4 no adjustment for dividends. except as provided in subsection 7.1, no adjustment in respect of any dividends shall be made during the term of a warrant or upon the exercise of a warrant. 7.5 statement on warrants. irrespective of any adjustments in the warrant price or the number or kind of shares purchasable upon the exercise of warrants, warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the initial warrant. section 8. fractional interests. the company shall not be required to issue fractional warrant shares on the exercise of warrants. if more than one warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same holder, the number of full warrant shares that shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of warrant shares purchasable on exercise of the warrants so presented. if any fraction of a warrant share would, after giving effect to the provisions of this section 8, be issuable on the exercise of any warrant (or specified portion thereof), the company shall, in lieu of issuance of such fraction of a warrant share, calculate and pay an amount in cash equal to the closing price per warrant share on the trading day immediately preceding the date of exercise of the warrant multiplied by such fraction. the closing price shall be the last reported sales price regular way or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices regular way, in either case on the principal stock exchange on which the common shares is listed or admitted to trading, or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the fair market value of the common shares as determined by good faith action of the board of directors of the company. section 9. no rights as shareholder; notices to holders. nothing contained in this warrant or in any of the warrants shall be construed as conferring upon the holders or their transferees the right to vote or to receive dividends or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of any meeting of shareholders for the election of directors of the company or any other matter, or any rights whatsoever as shareholders of the company. if, however, at any time prior to the expiration of the warrants and prior to their exercise, any of the following events shall occur: (a) the company shall declare any dividend (or any other distribution) on common shares, other than a cash dividend or shall declare or authorize repurchase of in excess of 10% of the then outstanding shares of common shares; or (b) the company shall authorize the granting to all holders of common shares of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other rights or warrants; or ann the company shall propose any capital reorganization, recapitalization, subdivision or reclassification of common shares (other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding common shares or shares, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value), or any consolidation or merger to which the company is a party for which approval of any shareholders of the company shall be required, or the sale, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the company; or (d) the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company (other than in connection with a consolidation, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of its property, assets and business as an entirety) shall be proposed; then in any one or more of said events, the company shall give notice in writing of such event to the holders at least 15 days prior to the date fixed as a record date or the date of closing the transfer books for the determination of the shareholders entitled to such dividend, distribution, or subscription rights, or for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on such proposed consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease of assets, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. section 10. notices. all notices, requests and other communications with respect to the warrants shall be in writing. communications may be made by telecopy or similar writing. each communication shall be given to the holder at the address in the warrant register and the company at its offices in calgary, alberta, or at any other address as the party may specify for this purpose by notice to the other party. each communication shall be effective (1) if given by telecopy, when the telecopy is transmitted to the proper address and the receipt of the transmission is confirmed, or (2) if given by any other means, when delivered to the proper address and a written acknowledgement of delivery is received. section 11. no waivers; remedies; specific performance. (a) prior to the expiration date, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege with respect to the warrants shall operate as a waiver of the right, power or privilege. a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege shall not preclude any other or further exercise of the right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. the rights and remedies provided in the warrants shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. (b) in view of the uniqueness of the warrants, a holder would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages in the event that any of the obligations arising under the warrants is not performed in accordance with its terms, and the company therefore agrees that the holders shall be entitled to specific enforcement of the terms of the warrants in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity. section 12. amendments, etc. no amendment, modification, termination, or waiver of any provision of a warrant, and no consent to any departure from any provision of the warrant, shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed and delivered by the company and the holder, and then it shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given. the rights of the holder and the terms and provisions of this warrant including, without limitation, the performance of the obligations of the company hereunder, shall not be affected in any manner whatsoever by the terms and provisions of any other agreement, whether entered into prior to or after the date of this warrant. section 13. governing law. the warrants shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the province of alberta. all rights and obligations of the company shall be in addition to and not in limitation of those provided by applicable law. section 14. severability of provisions. any provision of the warrants that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of the prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of the warrants or affecting the validity or enforceability of the provision in any other jurisdiction. section 15. headings and references. headings in the warrants are included for the convenience of reference only and do not constitute a part of the warrants for any other purpose. references to parties and sections in the warrant are references to the parties or the sections of the warrant, as the case may be, unless the context shall require otherwise. section 16. exclusive jurisdiction. each of the company and the holder, by acceptance hereof, (1) agrees that any legal action with respect to the warrant shall be brought exclusively in the courts of the province of alberta, (2) accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of those courts, and (3) irrevocably waives any objection, including, without limitation, any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any legal action in those jurisdictions; provided, however, that each of the company and the holder may assert in a legal action in any other jurisdiction or venue each mandatory defense, third-party claim or similar claim that, if not so asserted in such action, may not be asserted in an original legal action in the courts referred to in clause (1) above. section 17. merger or amalgamation of the company. the company will not merge or amalgamate with or into any other corporation unless the corporation resulting from such merger or amalgamation (if not the company) shall expressly assume, by supplemental agreement, the due and punctual performance and observance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company. this warrant is executed by the company on the date set forth

between: saxon petroleum inc., a corporation amalgamated under the laws of the province of alberta (herein "saxon") - and - forest oil corporation, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of new york (herein "forest") whereas saxon intends to issue to forest common shares, non- voting shares and convertible preferred shares and warrants pursuant to a purchase agreement (the "purchase agreement") dated october 6, 1995; and whereas forest and saxon wish to provide terms upon which forest would be able to acquire equity securities (as that term is defined herein) from time to time and upon the happening of certain events. now therefore this agreement witnesseth that in consideration of the sum of $1.00 and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows: 1. definitions in this agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (a) "common shares" means common shares of saxon as constituted from time to time during the term of this agreement; (b) "equity securities" means a security entitled to vote at meetings of shareholders of saxon generally and includes any securities convertible into or exchangeable for securities entitled to vote at meetings of shareholders of saxon generally and as the context may allow, includes equivalent equity securities; (c) "equivalent equity securities" means equity securities of the same class and entitling the holder thereof to the same rights as the applicable equity securities and includes securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities; (d) "issuance" means any issuance by saxon of any equity securities at any time or from time to time whether out of treasury, by contract, operation of law conversion, exchange or otherwise, and an issuance shall be deemed to have occurred upon the amendment of the terms of any securities previously issued and then currently outstanding, the effect of which amendment is that a security becomes an equity security or the voting rights attaching thereto are thereby created or enhanced; (e) "proportionate number" or, sometimes herein "its proportionate number" or "forest's proportionate number" means that number of equivalent equity securities which when purchased by forest would result in forest owning the applicable percentage determined below of the total of the number of shares subject to an issuance and the number available for purchase by forest: percentage of total issued common shares and non-voting shares owned by forest immediately before the time of issuance forest's proportionate number 45% or more 60% more than 30% but less than 45% 45% more than 20% but less than 30% 30% 2. grant of option 2.1 saxon hereby grants to forest on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth an irrevocable option (the "option") to acquire at any time or from time to time during the period described in section 2.2 all or any of the equivalent equity securities which become subject to the option from time to time, it being understood that the option is to acquire (following the issuance and in addition to any equity securities, options, rights or warrants or other securities that are being issued to forest in connection with the issuance) (i) equity securities which are the subject of public offerings as referred to in section 3.1, (ii) equity securities which are the subject of the issuances referred to in section 4.1, (iii) equity securities which are issued upon the exercise of the options, rights or warrants which are referred to in section 4.2, (iv) the underlying equity securities issued upon the exercise of employee stock options or other benefits pursuant to the issuances referred to in section 4.3, and (v) equity securities which are subject to issuances referred to in section 4.5. the option hereby granted is subject to acceptance for filing of notice of the grant of the option by the alberta stock exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, in each case pursuant to its rules and by-laws and saxon covenants to use its best efforts to obtain such acceptances from time to time as may be applicable. 2.2 forest shall have the right to exercise the option at any time and from time to time during the term commencing on the date hereof and expiring, at 5:00 p.m. (calgary time) on the 5th anniversary of the date hereof (the "expiry time"). 3. concerning issuances by way of a public offering 3.1 upon any issuance constituting a public offering of equity securities by saxon, forest shall have the right to purchase at the price per equity security at which equity securities are being offered to the public, which price is payable in the manner provided in section 5.5, all or any part of its proportionate number of such equity securities. 4. concerning issuances in other circumstances 4.1 other than as contemplated by sections 4.2 or 4.3, upon any issuance which does not constitute a public offering by saxon or upon the issuance by saxon to any other party or parties of any equity securities in any circumstances in which forest is not provided the opportunity to acquire its proportionate number of equity securities at the same time and on the same basis as the equity securities issued to the other party or parties, forest shall have the option to acquire all or any part of its proportionate number of equivalent equity securities and shall pay therefor in the manner provided in section 5.5 (i) the same consideration per equivalent equity security as was or is to be received by saxon per equity security from such other party or parties, or (ii) the fair equivalent of such non-cash consideration per equivalent equity security as was or is to be received by saxon per equity security from the other party or parties, as determined by the board of directors of saxon. by way of illustration only, such issuances may include an issuance of equity securities pursuant to a private placement, an amalgamation, a securities exchange take-over bid or an asset acquisition which includes all or partial consideration in the form of equity securities. 4.2 upon the issuance by saxon to any other party or parties of any equity securities pursuant to the exercise of an option to such third party or parties (other than employee stock options) or the issuance of equity securities pursuant to the exercise of rights (including conversion or exchange rights) or warrants to acquire equity securities (including for greater certainty those referred to in sections 4.22(b)(3), (4), (5) and (6) of the purchase agreement), forest shall have the option to acquire its proportionate number of equivalent equity securities on the same terms, including exercise price, as such options, rights or warrants were exercised and to pay therefor in the manner provided in section 5.5 (i) the same consideration for such equity securities received by saxon from such other party or parties or (ii) the fair equivalent of such non-cash consideration for such equity securities received by saxon from the other party or
