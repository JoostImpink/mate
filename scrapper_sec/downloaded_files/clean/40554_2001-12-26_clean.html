(d) and (e) during the last five years none of the reporting persons, nor, to the best of their knowledge, any person identified in schedules i through v has been (i) convicted of any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. not applicable. item 4. purpose of transaction. on december 14, 2001, security capital, ge capital and eb entered into a agreement and plan of merger, dated as of december 14, 2001 (the "merger agreement"), a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit 1 and is hereby incorporated by reference. pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, eb will merge with and into security capital (the "merger"), with security capital as the surviving company. as a result of the merger, security capital will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ge capital. in the merger, shares of security capital's class b common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "class b shares"), will be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of $26 in cash per share, subject to the substitution therefor as described below and in the merger agreement of a combination of cash and the common stock with an agreed aggregate value of $26 per class b share (the "class b consideration"), and shares of security capital's class a common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "class a shares"), will be converted into the right to receive 50 times the class b consideration (the "class a consideration"). ge capital may elect (but no later than the 15th day before security capital's stockholder meeting to vote on the merger and the merger agreement (the "group stockholder meeting")) to include the common stock owned by security capital as part of the class a consideration and the class b consideration. if ge capital so elects, the holders of class b shares would receive $26 in cash per class b share less the value of the common stock 8 received by them (with the common stock valued for such purposes based upon the 10-day trailing average price of the common stock 2 days prior to the group stockholder meeting), and the holders of the class a shares would receive 50 times such amount. ge capital may also revoke its election to include the common stock as part of the class a consideration and class b consideration, provided however that no such revocation may be made if such revocation would make it reasonably necessary, based upon the advice of security capital's independent counsel, to delay the group stockholder meeting. with the prior written consent of both security capital and ge capital, security capital may at any time sell any or all of the common stock beneficially owned by it, including to the company, pursuant to a public offering or private placement, negotiated third-party purchase or otherwise (a "prologis sale"). in addition, security capital will, at the written request of ge capital, use its reasonable best efforts to effect a prologis sale in the manner requested by ge capital, and subject to approval by ge capital of any final pricing terms. however, security capital shall not be required to effect a prologis sale, or enter into any binding agreement to effect a prologis sale, prior to the date which is 18 days prior to the then-applicable date of the group stockholder meeting (provided that if a "road show" with respect to a prologis sale to be effected by a public offering shall have been commenced on or after the date which is 22 days prior to the then-applicable date of the group stockholder meeting, and there shall thereafter be a delay or postponement of the date of the group stockholder meeting, the relevant date which is 18 days prior to the previously-applicable date of the group stockholder meeting shall not be changed for purposes of these obligations). security capital will, after consultation with ge capital, determine the manager(s) and book runner(s) in the event of any prologis sale that is an underwritten offering. in section 5.1 of the merger agreement, security capital has agreed, among other things, to conduct its operations in the ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practice and not to take certain actions, including, among other actions, not to sell, lease or dispose of any assets (including the shares of common stock beneficially owned by security capital) outside the ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practice (the "ordinary course covenants"). security capital also has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its public investees, including the company, to comply with the ordinary course covenants. the merger agreement provides that for these purposes, security capital shall be deemed to have used its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its public investees (including the company) to take or not take any actions contemplated by such section 5.1 if security capital (i) exercises all voting rights to the extent that the taking or not taking of any action requires a vote of the stockholders of such public investee, (ii) exercises all rights under any contract or agreement to which security capital or any of its subsidiaries is a party, and (iii) causes its representatives acting as members of the board of directors or trustees of such public investees subject to their fiduciary duties to such public investees or trustees and their shareholders under applicable law, to exercise all rights as directors of such public investee, as applicable. 9 consummation of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the merger agreement by a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock of security capital, the absence of any injunction or other government action preventing the merger, obtaining antitrust and other required regulatory approvals, the effective registration of the common stock, the accuracy of each parties representations and warranties and compliance with covenants, and the absence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) having occurred as to security capital. the description of the merger agreement set forth in this schedule 13d is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement, which is attached hereto as described above and

(c) except for the execution and delivery of the merger agreement referenced in item 4 hereof, no transactions in shares of common stock were effected by any of the reporting persons, or, to the best of their knowledge, any of the persons identified in schedules i through v hereto, during the 60 days prior to the date hereof. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. except for the merger agreement, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) between any of the reporting persons or any other person with respect to any securities of the company, including but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies or a pledge 10 or contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power over the shares of common stock of the company.
