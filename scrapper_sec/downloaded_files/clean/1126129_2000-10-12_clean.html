(b) adjustments for combinations or consolidation of common stock. in the event the outstanding common stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of common stock, then and in each such case the applicable conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

(d) adjustments for reclassification, exchange and substitution. if the common stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision, combination or consolidation of shares, or merger, consolidation or asset sale, provided for in sections 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c) or any reclassification resulting from the adoption of the restated certificate of incorporation), then and in each such case the applicable conversion price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the series a-1 preferred stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of class b-1 common stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive (assuming that the restated charter effectiveness has occurred), a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of class b-1 common stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon any conversion (assuming that the restated charter effectiveness has occurred) immediately before that change. no class or series of common stock shall be so changed into shares of any other class or series of stock 24 unless a proportional and equivalent change is made with respect to all other classes or series of common stock. for avoidance of doubt, it is stipulated that the provisions of this section 8(d) shall not apply to any exchange of shares of common stock into shares of series b preferred stock pursuant to the jll exchange agreement. (e) adjustment of conversion price upon issuance of additional shares of common stock. in the event the corporation, at any time after the issue date and prior to the restated charter effectiveness, issues or sells additional shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then and in each such event, the applicable conversion price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue or sale, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the applicable conversion price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (b) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold would purchase at the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (b) the number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold. the provisions of this section 8(e) shall not apply to any issuance or sale of additional shares of common stock for which an adjustment is provided under section 8(a). (f) issue of securities deemed issue of additional shares of common stock. in the event (i) the corporation, at any time after the issue date and prior to the restated charter effectiveness, issues, sells or grants any options or convertible securities, or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such options or convertible securities and (ii) the consideration per share for the additional shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options, or in the case of convertible securities, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be less than the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issue, sale or grant, or such record date, as the case may be, then, and in each such case, (a) the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or, in the case of convertible securities and options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, shall be deemed to be issuances of additional shares of common stock issued as of the time of such issue, sale or grant or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, and (b) the conversion price shall be adjusted in accordance with section 8(e) on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, sale or grant, or the record date, as the case may be. in any such case in which additional shares of common stock are deemed to be issued or sold pursuant to this section 8(f): 25 (1) no further adjustment in the applicable conversion price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of convertible securities or common stock upon the exercise of such options or conversion or exchange of such convertible securities; (2) if such options or convertible securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any decrease in the consideration payable to the corporation, or increase in the number of additional shares of common stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the adjustments to the conversion price computed upon the original issue, sale, grant or assumption thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such decrease or increase becoming effective, be recomputed (and the conversion price shall automatically be adjusted as so recomputed) to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such convertible securities which are outstanding at such time; and (3) no readjustment pursuant to the preceding clause (2) shall have the effect of increasing the applicable conversion price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the applicable conversion price on the original adjustment date and (b) the applicable conversion price that would have resulted from any issuance of additional shares of common stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date. the consideration per share deemed to be received by the corporation for additional shares of common stock relating to options and convertible securities, shall be determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, actually received by the corporation as consideration for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of such options or convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating to such options or convertible securities without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the corporation upon the exercise in full of such options or the conversion or exchange in full of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise in full of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange in full of such convertible securities, by (y) the maximum number of additional shares of common stock (as set forth in the instruments relating to such options or convertible securities, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (g) certain payments in lieu of dividends. in case the corporation, at any time on or after the issue date and prior to the restated charter effectiveness, shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its regular common stock evidences of 26 its indebtedness or assets (including securities other than dividends and distributions paid pursuant to section 8(a)), then the conversion price shall be adjusted by multiplying the conversion price then in effect by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be (a) the current market price of a share of regular common stock on the record date fixed for such distribution minus (b) the market value of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of regular common stock and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the current market price of a share of regular common stock on the record date fixed for such distribution. (h) certificate as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the applicable conversion price pursuant to this section 8, the corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or to be received by the corporation for any additional shares of common stock, or any options or convertible securities, as the case may be, issued or sold or deemed to have been issued, (ii) the number of shares of common stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (iii) the applicable conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale and as adjusted and readjusted on account thereof. the corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) the applicable conversion price at the time in effect, and showing how it was calculated, and (ii) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon a conversion. at the request of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding series a-1 preferred stock, the corporation will have the certificates referred to in this section 8(h) prepared and delivered by an internationally recognized independent accounting firm. section 9. preemptive rights.

(c) in the case of any issuance of new securities, the corporation shall have 90 days from the date of the preemptive rights notice to consummate the proposed issuance of any or all of such new securities which the holders have not elected to purchase at the price and upon terms that are not materially less favorable to the corporation than those specified in the preemptive rights notice. at the consummation of such issuance, the corporation shall issue certificates representing the new securities to be purchased by each holder exercising preemptive rights pursuant to this section 9 registered in the name of such holder, against payment by such holder of the purchase price for such new securities. if the corporation proposes to issue such new securities after such 90-day period, it shall again comply with the procedures set forth in this section. 9. section 10. voting rights.

(e) reservation of shares; compliance with laws. the corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, such number of its authorized but unissued shares of regular common stock as shall be required for the purpose of effecting optional conversions of the series b preferred stock. promptly (and in any event no later than two business days) following receipt of stockholder approval, the corporation shall file the restated certificate of incorporation pursuant to the dgcl with the secretary of state of the state of delaware. prior to the delivery of any common stock that the corporation is obligated to deliver upon an optional conversion or mandatory conversion, the corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations which require action to be taken by the corporation. (f) transfer taxes, etc. the corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of common stock upon any conversion, other than any tax payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of common stock in a name other than that of the holder of the series b preferred stock to be converted. the corporation shall have the right not to issue or deliver any shares of common stock in a name other than that of the holder of the series b preferred stock to be converted unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid. (g) no fractional shares. no fractions of shares of common stock shall be required to be issued to a holder in connection with a conversion. in lieu thereof, the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the current market price per share of regular common stock on the conversion date. (h) no impairment. the corporation will not, through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be 20 observed or performed hereunder by the corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this section 7 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock against impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the corporation (i) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid nonassessable shares of common stock on any conversion, free of all preemptive rights, and (ii) will not take any action which results in any adjustment of the applicable conversion price if the total number of shares of common stock issuable after the action upon the conversion of all of the series b preferred stock will exceed the total number of shares of common stock then authorized by the corporation's certificate of incorporation and available for the purpose of issue upon such conversion. section 8. adjustments to conversion price. (a) adjustment for stock dividends, distributions and subdivisions. in the event the corporation shall declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the common stock payable in shares of common stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding common stock, into a greater number of shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock), then and in each such case the applicable conversion price in effect immediately prior to such stock dividend, distribution or subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such stock dividend, distribution or subdivision, be proportionately decreased, subject to the following qualifications: (i) in the event such issuance is declared but not effected, the applicable conversion price shall be readjusted as if such issuance was not declared; and (ii) no adjustment in the conversion price shall be made in the event the holders simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such securities as they would have received had the series b preferred stock been converted into common stock pursuant to section 7 immediately prior to such event (or, if applicable, the record date for such event). (b) adjustments for combinations or consolidation of common stock. in the event the outstanding common stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of common stock, then and in each such case the applicable conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased. (c) adjustments for consolidation, merger, sale of assets, reorganization, etc. in the event the corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other corporation or entity and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii) permits any other corporation or entity to consolidate with or merge into the corporation and the corporation is the continuing or surviving corporation 21 but, in connection with such consolidation or merger, the shares of common stock are changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property, or (iii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets, directly or indirectly, to any other corporation or entity (other than to a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation if such subsidiary remains wholly owned by the corporation after such transfer or any other transaction or series of transactions related to such transfer), then, and in each such event, proper provision shall be made so that, upon the basis and the terms and in the manner provided in this section 8(c), each holder, upon any conversion at any time after the consummation of such consolidation, merger or transfer, shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the shares of common stock issuable upon any conversion prior to such consummation, the stock and other securities, cash and property to which such holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such holder had converted its series b preferred stock pursuant to section 7 immediately prior to such consummation (or, if applicable, any record date with respect to such transaction), subject to adjustments (subsequent to such corporate action) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this section 8(c). notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (a) the corporation will not effect any of the transactions described in the clauses (i) through (iii) of this section 8 unless, prior to the consummation thereof, each corporation (other than the corporation) which may be required to deliver any stock, securities, cash or property upon the conversion of series b preferred stock shall assume, by written instrument, a copy of which shall be delivered to each holder, the obligation to deliver to such holder such shares of stock, securities, cash or property as such holder may be entitled to receive upon such conversion, and (b) in the event the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of series b preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, elect to declare that any of the transactions described in clauses (i) through (iii) constitute a liquidation event, then the provisions of this section 8(c) shall not apply to such transaction and, in lieu thereof, the holders shall be entitled to the amounts set forth in section 5 with respect to such liquidation event. (d) adjustments for reclassification, exchange and substitution. if the common stock issuable upon any conversion is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision, combination or consolidation of shares, or merger, consolidation or asset sale, provided for in sections 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c) or any reclassification resulting from the adoption of the restated certificate of incorporation), then and in each such case the applicable conversion price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the series b preferred stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of common stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of common stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon any conversion immediately before that change. no class or series of common stock shall be so changed into shares of any other class or series of 22 stock unless a proportional and equivalent change is made with respect to all other classes or series of common stock. for avoidance of doubt, it is stipulated that the provisions of this section 8(d) shall not apply to any exchange of shares of common stock into shares of series b preferred stock pursuant to the jll exchange agreement. (e) adjustment of conversion price upon issuance of additional shares of common stock. in the event the corporation, at any time after the issue date, issues or sells additional shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then and in each such event, the applicable conversion price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue or sale, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the applicable conversion price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (b) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold would purchase at the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (b) the number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold. the provisions of this section 8(e) shall not apply to any issuance or sale of additional shares of common stock for which an adjustment is provided under section 8(a). (f) issue of securities deemed issue of additional shares of common stock. in the event (i) the corporation at any time after the issue date shall issue, sell or grant any options or convertible securities, or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such options or convertible securities and (ii) the consideration per share for the additional shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options, or in the case of convertible securities, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be less than the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issue, sale or grant, or such record date, as the case may be, then, and in each such case, (a) the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or, in the case of convertible securities and options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, shall be deemed to be issuances of additional shares of common stock issued as of the time of such issue, sale or grant or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, and (b) the conversion price shall be adjusted in accordance with section 8(e) on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, sale or grant, or the record date, as the case may be. in any such case in which additional shares of common stock are deemed to be issued or sold pursuant to this section 8(f): 23 (1) no further adjustment in the applicable conversion price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of convertible securities or common stock upon the exercise of such options or conversion or exchange of such convertible securities; (2) if such options or convertible securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any decrease in the consideration payable to the corporation, or increase in the number of additional shares of common stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the adjustments to the conversion price computed upon the original issue, sale, grant or assumption thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such decrease or increase becoming effective, be recomputed (and the conversion price shall automatically be adjusted as so recomputed) to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such convertible securities which are outstanding at such time; and (3) no readjustment pursuant to the preceding clause (2) shall have the effect of increasing the applicable conversion price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the applicable conversion price on the original adjustment date and (b) the applicable conversion price that would have resulted from any issuance of additional shares of common stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date. the consideration per share deemed to be received by the corporation for additional shares of common stock relating to options and convertible securities, shall be determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, actually received by the corporation as consideration for the issue, sale, grant or assumption of such options or convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating to such options or convertible securities without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the corporation upon the exercise in full of such options or the conversion or exchange in full of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise in full of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange in full of such convertible securities, by (y) the maximum number of additional shares of common stock (as set forth in the instruments relating to such options or convertible securities, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (g) certificate as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the applicable conversion price pursuant to this section 8, the corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in 24 accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or to be received by the corporation for any additional shares of common stock, or any options or convertible securities, as the case may be, issued or sold or deemed to have been issued, (ii) the number of shares of common stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (iii) the applicable conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale and as adjusted and readjusted on account thereof. the corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) the applicable conversion price at the time in effect, and showing how it was calculated, and (ii) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon a conversion. at the request of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding series b preferred stock, the corporation will have the certificates referred to in this section 8(g) prepared and delivered by an internationally recognized independent accounting firm. section 9. preemptive rights. (a) the corporation shall provide each holder with a written notice (a "preemptive rights notice") of any proposed issuance by the corporation of any new securities at least 30 days prior to the proposed issuance date. such notice shall specify the price at which the new securities are to be issued and the other material terms of the issuance. each holder shall be entitled to purchase, at the price and on the terms at which such new securities are proposed to be issued and specified in such preemptive rights notice, such holder's preemptive rights portion of such class of the new securities proposed to be issued. "preemptive rights portion" means the pro rata portion of new securities proposed to be issued by the corporation, which amount shall, for each holder, be based upon the ratio of (i) the number of shares of common stock that such holder would receive upon the conversion of its shares of series b preferred stock into common stock pursuant to section 7 immediately prior to the issuance of the new securities to (ii) the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to the issuance of the new securities (assuming (a) the conversion of all securities convertible into, and the exercise of all options, warrants or other arrangements representing the right to purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of common stock and (b) the receipt of stockholder approval and the filing of the restated certificate of incorporation according to the dgcl with the secretary of state of the state of delaware). (b) a holder may exercise its rights under this section 9 by delivering written notice of its election to purchase new securities to the corporation within 15 days of receipt of the preemptive rights notice. a delivery of such a written notice (which notice shall specify the amount of new securities to be purchased by the shareholder 25 submitting such notice) by such holder shall constitute a binding agreement of such holder to purchase, at the price and on the terms specified in the preemptive rights notice, the number of new securities specified in such holder's written notice. (c) in the case of any issuance of new securities, the corporation shall have 90 days from the date of the preemptive rights notice to consummate the proposed issuance of any or all of such new securities which the holders have not elected to purchase at the price and upon terms that are not materially less favorable to the corporation than those specified in the preemptive rights notice. at the consummation of such issuance, the corporation shall issue certificates representing the new securities to be purchased by each holder exercising preemptive rights pursuant to this section 9 registered in the name of such holder, against payment by such holder of the purchase price for such new securities. if the corporation proposes to issue such new securities after such 90-day period, it shall again comply with the procedures set forth in this section. 9. section 10. voting rights. (a) the holders shall not be entitled to any voting rights, except as hereinafter provided in this section 10 or as otherwise provided by dgcl or other applicable law.

(v) reclassify any shares of junior stock into shares of parity stock or senior stock, or any shares of parity stock into shares of senior stock, for avoidance of doubt it being stipulated that any exchange of shares of regular common stock into shares of series b preferred stock shall not be deemed a reclassification of such stock or require the approval of the holders pursuant to this section 10(c); (vi) repurchase or redeem any capital stock of the corporation, other than (a) the series a preferred stock issued on the issue date or issued as a dividend on the series a preferred stock in accordance with the applicable series a certificates of designations and (b) the redemption of the series b preferred stock pursuant to section 6, for avoidance of doubt it being stipulated that any exchange of shares of regular common stock into shares of series b preferred stock shall not be deemed a redemption or repurchase of such stock or require the approval of the holders pursuant to this section 10(c); 27 (vii) incur, or permit any of its subsidiaries to incur, any indebtedness (other than any indebtedness under the senior credit facility or the senior subordinated notes) that would result in the corporation having an interest coverage ratio of less than 1.50:1.00;

(viii) voluntarily file for bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation; (ix) increase the number of directors to more than eleven, unless the holders are entitled to elect an additional class b-1 director pursuant to clause (v) of section 10(f), or the holders of series a-2 preferred stock are entitled to elect an additional class b-2 director pursuant to the series a-2 certificate of designations, in which case the number of directors may be increased by the number of such additional directors; (x) have less than three of the employees or officers of the corporation or its subsidiaries serve as directors (and in the event of any vacancy resulting from the death, disability, resignation or removal of such a director, not have another employee or officer of the corporation or its subsidiaries elected or appointed promptly as a director to fill such vacancy); (xi) modify or repeal any of the provisions of the by-laws (a) requiring that, the board of directors meet no less frequently than once in every calendar quarter, (b) requiring that each committee of the board of directors (including any audit or compensation committee, but excluding any nominating committees for the nomination of directors) have, as members, a proportional number of class b-1 directors and class b-2 directors, as a group (in relation to the total number of directors), unless (1) such representation is prohibited by applicable law or rules of the nasdaq national market, in which case such committees shall have, as members, the maximum number of class b-1 directors and class b-2 directors permitted by applicable law and rules of the nasdaq national market, or (2) the class b-1 directors and class b-2 directors elect not to serve on any such committee, or (c) relating to the number, election, powers or rights of class b-1 directors, class b-2 directors or non-class b directors;

(e) the approval of holders of at least 75% of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred stock voting or consenting, as the case may be, shall be required for any amendment to this certificate of designations that reduces the liquidation preference or the mandatory redemption obligation or amends the provisions of section 3, 10(c) or 10(d) or this section 10(e). (f) the holders voting or consenting, as the case may be, separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect directors (the directors so elected, the "class b-1 directors") as follows: (i) on the issue date, two individuals designated by the holders of shares of series b preferred stock shall be elected as class b-1 directors.

(i) in the case of an optional conversion, the holder of the shares of class b common stock to be converted shall surrender the certificate representing such shares at the principal office of the corporation, with a written notice of election to convert completed and signed, specifying the number of shares to be converted. unless the shares issuable on such optional conversion are to be issued in the same name as the name in which such shares of class b common stock are registered, each share surrendered for such optional conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory 16 to the corporation, duly executed by the holder or the holder's duly authorized attorney. the corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates for shares of class a common stock in any name other than the name or names set forth on the certificates for the shares of class b common stock unless the requirements of the stockholders' agreement relating to the transfer of shares of class b common stock have been complied with or waived by the corporation. (ii) in the event of a mandatory conversion, (a) if such mandatory conversion is pursuant to clause (i) of section 5.3.7(b), all shares of class b common stock transferred in the related prohibited transfer, and (b) if such mandatory conversion is pursuant to clause (ii) of section 5.3.7(b), all outstanding shares of class b common stock, shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holder or holders thereof and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered at the office of the corporation. the corporation shall issue certificates representing the shares of class a common stock issuable upon such mandatory conversion upon the surrender of certificates representing the corresponding shares of class b common stock, in the same name as the name in which such shares of class b common stock are registered. (iii) notwithstanding clause (i) or (ii) of this section 5.3.7(d), if the holder of any share or shares of class b common stock certifies to the corporation that the certificates representing such share or shares have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the corporation to indemnify the corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates (and, if requested by the corporation, posts a customary bond reasonably satisfactory to the corporation to cover such loss), then the corporation shall issue certificates representing the class a common stock issuable upon any optional conversion or mandatory conversion, as the case may be, in the name of such holder. (iv) in connection with any conversion, as promptly as practicable after the delivery by a holder of shares of class b common stock of the certificates for shares of class b common stock (or in the case of a lost certificate, the certification, the agreement and, if requested, posting of the bond described in clause (iii) of this section 5.3.7(d)), the corporation shall issue and shall deliver to such holder, or, on the holder's written order, to the holder's transferee, (a) a certificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 5.3.7, (b) any cash adjustment required pursuant to section 5.3.7(g), and (c) in the event of an optional conversion in part, a certificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of class b common stock not being so converted. 17 (v) each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the applicable conversion date. the person in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of class a common stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of class a common stock represented thereby at such time on the applicable conversion date and such conversion shall be into a number of whole shares of class a common stock equal to the product of the number of shares of class b common stock surrendered multiplied by the conversion ratio in effect on the applicable conversion date. all shares of class a common stock delivered upon conversion of the class b common stock will upon delivery be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable, free of all liens, pledges and other security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights. as of the effective time of such conversion, the shares of class b common stock to be so converted will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of a holder with respect to such shares so converted shall immediately terminate, except the right to receive the class a common stock and other amounts payable pursuant to this section 5.3.7 and, in the event of an optional conversion in part, a certificate or certificates representing the shares of class b common stock not converted. (e) reservation of shares; compliance with laws. the corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, such number of its authorized but unissued shares of class a common stock as shall be required for the purpose of effecting conversions of class b common stock (including the conversion of all shares of class b common stock issuable from time to time upon conversion of shares of series a-1 preferred stock or series a-2 preferred stock). prior to the delivery of any class a common stock that the corporation is obligated to deliver upon an optional conversion or mandatory conversion, the corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations which require action to be taken by the corporation. (f) transfer taxes, etc. the corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of class a common stock upon any conversion, other than any tax payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of class a common stock in a name other than that of the holder of the class b common stock to be converted. the corporation shall have the right not to issue or deliver any shares of class a common stock in a name other than that of the holder of the class b common stock to be converted unless and until the person requesting such issuance or delivery has paid to the corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid. 18 (g) no fractional shares. no fractions of shares of class a common stock shall be required to be issued to a holder in connection with a conversion. in lieu thereof, the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the current market price per share of class a common stock on the conversion date. (h) no impairment. the corporation will not, through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this section 5.3.7 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the class b common stock against impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the corporation (i) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid nonassessable shares of class a common stock on any conversion, free of all preemptive rights, and (ii) will not take any action which results in any adjustment of the applicable conversion ratio if the total number of shares of class a common stock issuable after the action upon the conversion of all of the class b common stock (including the conversion of all shares of class b common stock issuable from time to time upon conversion of shares of series a-1 preferred stock or series a-2 preferred stock) will exceed the total number of shares of class a common stock then authorized by this certificate of incorporation and available for the purpose of issuance upon such conversion. 5.3.8 adjustments to conversion ratio. (a) adjustment of conversion ratio upon issuance of additional shares of common stock. in the event the corporation, at any time after the effective date, issues or sells additional shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then and in each such event, the conversion ratio shall be adjusted, concurrently with such issue or sale, by multiplying the conversion ratio then in effect by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale plus (b) the number of shares of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus (b) the number of shares of common stock that the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued or sold would purchase at the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale. the provisions of this section 5.3.8(a) shall not apply to any issuance or sale of additional shares of common stock subject to the provisions of sections 5.3.3 or 5.3.5. 19 (b) issuances of securities deemed issuances of additional shares of common stock. in the event (x) the corporation at any time after the effective date shall issue, sell or grant any options or convertible securities, or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such options or convertible securities and (y) the consideration per share for the additional shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options, or in the case of convertible securities, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be less than the current market price in effect immediately prior to such issue, sale or grant, or such record date, as the case may be, then, and in each such case, (a) the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or, in the case of convertible securities and options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, shall be deemed to be issuances of additional shares of common stock issued as of the time of such issue, sale or grant or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, and (b) the conversion ratio shall be adjusted in accordance with section 5.3.8(a) on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, sale or grant, or the record date, as the case may be. in any such case in which additional shares of common stock are deemed to be issued or sold pursuant to this section 5.3.8(b): (1) no further adjustment in the applicable conversion ratio shall be made upon the subsequent issuance of convertible securities or common stock upon the exercise of such options or conversion or exchange of such convertible securities; (2) if such options or convertible securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any decrease in the consideration payable to the corporation, or increase in the number of additional shares of common stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the adjustments to the conversion ratio computed upon the original issue, sale, grant or assumption thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such decrease or increase becoming effective, be recomputed (and the conversion ratio shall automatically be adjusted as so recomputed) to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such convertible securities which are outstanding at such time; and (3) no readjustment pursuant to the preceding clause (2) shall have the effect of decreasing the applicable conversion ratio to an amount which is less than the higher of (a) the applicable conversion ratio on the original adjustment date and (b) the applicable conversion ratio that would have resulted from any 20 issuance of additional shares of common stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date. the consideration per share deemed to be received by the corporation for additional shares of common stock relating to options and convertible securities, shall be determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, actually received by the corporation as consideration for the issuance, sale, grant or assumption of such options or convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating to such options or convertible securities without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the corporation upon the exercise in full of such options or the conversion or exchange in full of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise in full of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange in full of such convertible securities, by (y) the maximum number of additional shares of common stock (as set forth in the instruments relating to such options or convertible securities, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (c) certificate as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the applicable conversion ratio pursuant to this section 5.3.8, the corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of shares of series a preferred stock and class b common stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (i) the consideration received or to be received by the corporation for any additional shares of common stock, or any options or convertible securities, as the case may be, issued or sold or deemed to have been issued, (ii) the number of shares of common stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (iii) the applicable conversion ratio in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale and as adjusted and readjusted on account thereof. the corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of shares of series a preferred stock or class b common stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) the applicable conversion ratio at the time in effect, and showing how it was calculated, and (ii) the number of shares of class a common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon a conversion. at the request of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding class b common stock, the corporation will have the certificates referred to in this section 5.3.8(c) prepared and delivered by an internationally recognized independent accounting firm. 21 5.3.9 preemptive rights. (a) the corporation shall provide each holder of class b common stock with a written notice (a "preemptive rights notice") of any proposed issuance by the corporation of any new securities at least 30 days prior to the proposed issuance date. such notice shall specify the price at which the new securities are to be issued and the other material terms of the issuance. each holder of class b common stock shall be entitled to purchase, at the price and on the terms at which such new securities are proposed to be issued and specified in such preemptive rights notice, such holder's preemptive rights portion of such class of the new securities proposed to be issued. "preemptive rights portion" means the pro rata portion of new securities proposed to be issued by the corporation, which amount shall, for each holder of class b common stock, be based upon the ratio of (i) the number of shares of class a common stock into which such holder's class b common stock would be convertible immediately prior to the issuance of the new securities to (ii) the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to the issuance of the new securities (assuming the conversion of all securities convertible into, and the exercise of all options, warrants or other arrangements representing the right to purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of common stock). (b) a holder of class b common stock may exercise its rights under this section 5.3.9 by delivering written notice of its election to purchase new securities to the corporation within 15 days of receipt of the preemptive rights notice. a delivery of such a written notice (which notice shall specify the amount of new securities to be purchased by the holder submitting such notice) by such holder shall constitute a binding agreement of such holder to purchase, at the price and on the terms specified in the preemptive rights notice, the number of new securities specified in such holder's written notice. (c) in the case of any issuance of new securities, the corporation shall have 90 days from the date of the preemptive rights notice to consummate the proposed issuance of any or all of such new securities which the holders of class b common stock have not elected to purchase at the price and upon terms that are not materially less favorable to the corporation than those specified in the preemptive rights notice. at the consummation of such issuance, the corporation shall issue certificates representing the new securities to be purchased by each holder of class b common stock exercising preemptive rights pursuant to this section 5.3.9 registered in the name of such holder, against payment by such holder of the purchase price for such new securities. if the corporation proposes to issue such new securities after such 90-day period, it shall again comply with the procedures set forth in this section 5.3.9. (d) other than as provided in this certificate with respect to the class b common stock or series a preferred stock or as specifically authorized in the certificate 22 of designation establishing the terms of any other series of preferred stock or in an agreement approved by the board of directors, no holder of shares of any class or series of capital stock shall be entitled to any preemptive or preferential right to purchase or subscribe to the capital stock. 5.3.10 voting rights.
