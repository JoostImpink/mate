merger (as amended from time to time, the "merger agreement"). the following is a summary of the merger agreement. this summary is not a complete description of the merger agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is filed as exhibit 2 hereto, and which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. the merger agreement provides for a taxable reverse triangular merger (the "merger"), in connection with which sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of netratings, will merge with and into jupiter media metrix. at the effective time of the merger, the separate existence of sub will cease, and jupiter media metrix will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of netratings. jupiter media metrix stockholders can elect to receive, for each share of jupiter media metrix common stock held by them, either (i) $1.95 in cash ("cash consideration") or (ii) 0.1490 shares of netratings common stock ("share consideration"), subject to pro-ration such that no more than 50% of the "aggregate transaction value" (i.e., the cash consideration times the number of outstanding shares of jupiter media metrix common stock) will be paid in cash and at least 30% of the aggregate transaction value will be paid in cash. the purchase price will be reduced dollar for dollar to the extent (a) the expenses incurred in terminating certain of jupiter media metrix's foreign joint ventures exceed $5 million, and (b) of jupiter media metrix's borrowings (including interest) under the $25 million credit facility being made available by netratings to jupiter media metrix (the "credit facility") described in the following paragraph. the merger agreement contains a "no shop" provision which limits the ability of the company to engage in, discuss and consider mergers and other business combination transactions other than the merger. also, the merger agreement contemplates that certain international operations and joint ventures of jupiter media metrix will be terminated prior to the closing of the merger and the costs of such termination will, subject to certain exceptions, be included in the potential reduction in purchase price described above if and to the extent they exceed $5 million. netratings shares to be issued in the merger will be registered on an s-4 registration statement to be filed by netratings with the securities and exchange commission. netratings has made the credit facility available to jupiter media metrix under a loan and security agreement (the "loan and security agreement"), dated as of october 25, 2001, among 8 netratings, as lender, jupiter media metrix and adrelevance, inc., irg acquisition corp., jupiter communications, inc., mmxi holdings, inc. and net market makers, inc., each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of jupiter media metrix (collectively the "borrower"). this paragraph and the immediately preceding paragraph do not contain a complete description of the credit facility or the loan and security agreement, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the loan and security agreement, which is filed as exhibit 4 hereto, and which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. under the loan and security agreement, the borrowers have granted to netratings a first priority lien on substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets (the "collateral") in order to secure their obligations to netratings in connection with the credit facility. if an event of default should occur and be continuing under the credit facility, netratings would be entitled to exercise rights and remedies with respect to the collateral that are of the nature customarily available to secured lenders upon the occurrence of an event of default by a borrower. also in connection with the merger, (i) the directors of sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger would become the directors of jupiter media metrix, (ii) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of jupiter media metrix would be amended and restated at the effective time of the merger as contemplated by the merger agreement, (iii) the registration of the jupiter media metrix common stock would, pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, be terminated and (iv) the jupiter media metrix common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq national market. the closing of the merger under the merger agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions. concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, as an inducement and in consideration of netratings and sub entering into the merger agreement, the stockholders (which include all of the current directors of jupiter media metrix) have entered into the stockholders agreement with netratings and sub. the following summary of the stockholders agreement is not a complete description of the stockholders agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the stockholders agreement, which is filed as exhibit 3 hereto, and which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, each stockholder has agreed to vote, at any meeting of the stockholders of jupiter media metrix and any adjournments or postponements thereof (or to execute written consents in respect of), all shares of jupiter media metrix common stock held by him as of the date of the stockholders agreement (as set forth opposite his name in schedule i to the stockholders agreement) and all shares of jupiter media metrix common stock acquired by him after the date of the stockholders agreement, whether pursuant to the exercise of options to purchase shares of jupiter media metrix common stock or otherwise, (i) in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement (including, subject to certain exceptions, any revised or amended merger agreement approved by the board of directors of jupiter media metrix) and (ii) against certain alternative merger and business combination proposals and certain other transactions or actions, including but not limited to the dissolution or liquidation of jupiter media metrix or amendments to jupiter media metrix's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, that could reasonably be expected to frustrate, impede or delay the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. each stockholder has also granted netratings, and any designee of netratings, an irrevocable proxy to vote such stockholder's shares in accordance with the voting obligations of the stockholders agreement, at any meeting of jupiter media metrix stockholders, however called (and execute written consents with respect to such shares), as security for performance by the stockholders of their obligations thereunder (the "proxy"). under the stockholders agreement, the stockholders also agreed to certain restrictions on their ability to transfer or agree to transfer their shares, grant proxies with respect to their shares, enter into voting trusts or voting agreements or similar agreements or arrangements with respect to their shares or take other actions that would in any way restrict, limit or interfere with their obligations under the stockholders agreement. further, the stockholders agreement contains a nonsolicitation covenant prohibiting the stockholders (in their capacities as 9 stockholders of jupiter media metrix) from engaging in discussions, negotiations and communications, and entering into agreements, with respect to certain competing merger and business combination transaction proposals relating to jupiter media metrix, and requiring them to keep netratings informed as to the existence and terms and conditions of any such proposals. the table below lists, in addition to certain additional information, the names of each stockholder and the number of shares beneficially owned by each such stockholder in which the reporting persons may be deemed to have beneficial ownership because of the proxy and the stockholders agreement, as described in item 5 below. name of stockholder number of shares of jupiter media

or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under delaware general corporation law. section 8.6 effect of amendment. any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision
