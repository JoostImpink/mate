the issuer is one of the market leaders in the solar industry, with distinctive competitive and technological advantages over its competitors. its technology is market-leading, with some of the highest power cell conversion rates in the industry. &#149; the issuer has significant momentum in key solar markets and is a robust, highly visible industry player. page 5 of 40 &#149; the issuer is vertically integrated along the solar value chain, with significant manufacturing capabilities that will be enhanced by the financial support that total brings to the partnership. &#149; total and the issuer share a common vision for the solar industry: a wide variety of energy sources will be required to meet coming increases in global energy demand, and the development of renewable energies&#151;particularly solar&#151;will be paramount in ensuring a balanced energy mix alongside conventional resources. &#149; total has a history of research and development partnerships, and the relationship with the issuer builds on that successful foundation. &#149; through access to total&#146;s financial strength, the issuer will have additional resources to accelerate the development of its business and further leverage its existing technology. &#149; the issuer&#146;s management team will continue to operate the issuer as a stand-alone business, supported by strategic and operational resources from total. on april 28, 2011, purchaser and the issuer entered into a tender offer agreement (as amended, the &#147;tender offer agreement&#148;) pursuant to which purchaser commenced a tender offer to acquire up to 34,144,400 shares of class a common stock and up to 25,220,000 shares of class b common stock for $23.25 per share, net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes (the &#147;offer&#148;), with the right, under certain circumstances, without amending or extending the offer, to purchase an additional number of shares of class a common stock and class b common stock that were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn. on june 15, 2011, purchaser consummated the offer and subsequently acquired 34,756,682 shares of class a common stock and 25,220,000 shares of class b common stock. as a result of the offer, purchaser is now the majority stockholder of the issuer. subject to the terms and conditions of the affiliation agreement (as defined below), the reporting persons may purchase additional shares. such acquisitions could be in the open market and/or in privately negotiated or structured transactions. in addition, pursuant to the affiliation agreement, the reporting persons have (i) the right to appointment certain members of the board of directors of the issuer (the &#147;board&#148;) and (ii) have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the reclassification proposal (as defined below). from time to time, the reporting persons may formulate plans or proposals for, hold discussions with the board, the issuer&#146;s management and stockholders, and other parties about, and reserve the right to explore, or make plans or proposals relating to, transactions, discussions or actions that relate to or would result in any of the matters specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. the reporting persons&#146;

or &#149; enter into any discussions with any third party regarding any of the foregoing. in addition, no member of the total group may, among other things, solicit proxies relating to the election of directors to the board without the prior approval of the disinterested directors. however, the total group is permitted to: &#149;

and &#149; the termination of the affiliation agreement. the &#147;applicable standstill limit&#148; is the applicable percentage of the lower of (i) the outstanding shares or (ii) the then outstanding voting power of the issuer equal to: &#149; 63% during the period commencing with the closing of the offer and ending on june 15, 2013; &#149; 66 2 / 3 % during the period commencing on the second anniversary of the closing of the offer and ending on december 31, 2014;

purchaser promptly notifies the issuer; &#149; the total group causes such shares to be voted in direct proportion to the manner in which all stockholders of the issuer other than the total group and the issuer&#146;s directors or executives vote; and &#149; within the time periods provided in the affiliation agreement, the total group sells such excess shares to the issuer or on the open market. if during the standstill period any member of the total group acquires beneficial ownership of shares in excess of the applicable standstill limit as the result of the conversion of any convertible page 8 of 40 securities issued by the issuer that were acquired by the total group directly from the issuer, then the total group will not be in breach of its standstill obligations described above so long as: &#149; purchaser promptly notifies the issuer; and &#149; causes such shares to be voted in direct proportion to the manner in which all stockholders of the issuer, other than the total group and the issuer&#146;s directors or executives, vote. during the standstill period, the total group will not be in breach of its standstill obligations described above if any member of the total group holds beneficial ownership of shares in excess of the applicable standstill limit solely as a result of: &#149; recapitalizations, repurchases or other actions taken by the issuer or its controlled subsidiaries that have the effect of reducing the number of shares then outstanding; &#149; the issuance of shares to purchaser in connection with the acquisition by the issuer of tenesol s.a. (&#147;tenesol&#148;); or &#149; the rights specified in any &#147;poison pill&#148; share purchase rights plan of the issuer having separated from the shares and a member of the total group having exercised such rights. transfer of control . if any member or members of the total group seek to transfer, in one or a series of transactions, either (i) 40% or more of the outstanding shares or (ii) 40% or more of the outstanding voting power of the issuer to a single person or group, then such transfer must be conditioned on, and may not be effected, unless the transferee either: &#149; makes a tender offer to acquire 100% of the voting power of the issuer, at the same price per share of voting stock and using the same form of consideration to be paid by the transferee to the total group, and the completion of such tender offer is conditioned on (i) a majority of the shares of voting stock held by stockholders that are not members of the total group being tendered and (ii) an irrevocable, unwaivable commitment by the transferee to promptly acquire in a subsequent merger any shares not purchased in such tender offer, to the extent any shares are purchased in such tender offer, for the same amount and form of consideration per share offered in such tender offer; or &#149; proposes a merger providing for the acquisition of 100% of the voting power of the issuer, at the same price per share of voting stock and using the same form of consideration to be paid by the transferee to the total group, and the consummation of such merger is conditioned upon the approval of shares of voting stock representing a majority of the shares of voting stock held by stockholders that are not members of the total group. purchaser&#146;s rights to maintain . the total group has the following rights to maintain its ownership in the issuer until (i) the first time that the total group owns less than 40% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer or (ii) until the first time that purchaser or any controlled subsidiary of total transfers shares to a person other than a controlled subsidiary of total and as a result of such transfer purchaser, together with the controlled subsidiaries of total, owns less than 50% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer (in each case, regardless of whether such event occurs as a result of a recapitalization of the issuer, a repurchase of securities by the issuer or the total group subsequently increases its ownership of the issuer in the future). page 9 of 40 if the issuer proposes to issue new securities primarily for cash in a financing transaction, then purchaser has the right to purchase a portion of such issuance equal to its percentage ownership of the issuer and the issuer is obligated to provide purchaser with advance notice of any such issuance. purchaser can also elect to purchase securities in open market purchases or through privately-negotiated transactions in an amount equal to its percentage ownership of the issuer in connection with such issuance. if the issuer proposes to issue new securities in consideration for a business or asset of a business, then purchaser has the right to purchase additional securities in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions equal to its percentage ownership of the issuer and the issuer is obligated to provide purchaser with advance notice of any such issuance. purchaser has similar rights in the event that the issuer issues or proposes to issue (including pursuant to its equity plans or as the result of conversion of convertible securities issued by the issuer) securities that, together with all other issuances of securities by the issuer since the end of the preceding fiscal quarter aggregate to more than 1% of the issuer&#146;s fully diluted equity. so long as purchaser provides the issuer with appropriate notice within the time periods established by the affiliation agreement, purchaser has a nine month grace period, subject to certain extensions to satisfy regulatory conditions, to acquire securities in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions in connection with any of the issuances described above and such securities will be deemed to have been owned by purchaser for purposes of the affiliation agreement. board . except as modified by the terms of the affiliation agreement amendment, the affiliation agreement provides that, immediately after the consummation of the offer, the board will be expanded to eleven persons, composed of the chief executive officer of the issuer (who will also serve as the chairman of the board), four current members of the board and six directors designated by purchaser. the four current members of the board who will continue on the board following the consummation of the offer are w. steve albrecht, betsy s. atkins, thomas r. mcdaniel and pat wood iii. on the first anniversary of the completion of the offer (i) the disinterested directors are obligated to cause one the disinterested directors to resign from the board, (ii) upon the effectiveness of such resignation, purchaser will promptly cause one of the directors designated by purchaser to resign from the board and (iii) thereafter the board will take all action necessary to reduce the number of authorized members of the board to nine directors (such actions, a &#147;board reduction event&#148;). except as modified by the terms of the affiliation agreement amendment, so long as purchaser, together with the controlled subsidiaries of total, owns at least 10% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer, the board must use its reasonable best efforts to elect the directors designated by purchaser as follows: &#149; until the first time that purchaser, together with controlled subsidiaries of total, own less than 50% of the voting power of the issuer, purchaser will be entitled to designate six nominees to serve on the board until the board reduction event, and five nominees to serve on the board thereafter; &#149; until the first time that purchaser, together with controlled subsidiaries of total, own less than 50% but not less than 40% of the voting power of the issuer, purchaser will be entitled to designate five nominees to serve on the board until the board reduction event, and four nominees to serve on the board thereafter; page 10 of 40 &#149; until the first time that purchaser, together with controlled subsidiaries of total, own less than 40% but not less than 30% of the voting power of the issuer, purchaser will be entitled to designate four nominees to serve on the board until the board reduction event, and three nominees to serve on the board thereafter; &#149; until the first time that purchaser, together with controlled subsidiaries of total, own less than 30% but not less than 20% of the voting power of the issuer, purchaser will be entitled to designate three nominees to serve on the board until the board reduction event, and two nominees to serve on the board thereafter; and &#149; until the first time that purchaser, together with controlled subsidiaries of total, own less than 20% but not less than 10% of the voting power of the issuer, purchaser will be entitled to designate two nominees to serve on the board until the board reduction event, and one nominee to serve on the board after thereafter. if at any time the number of directors designated by the total group exceeds the number of directors that the total group is entitled to designate, the total group will cause such excess director to resign and such director will be replaced by a director who is independent for stock exchange listing purposes and is selected by the nominating and governance committee of the board. if any director designated by total ceases to serve on the board for any reason (other than as a result of purchaser no longer being able to designate such director), the board must promptly take all action necessary to appoint a replacement director designated by purchaser. until such replacement has been appointed, the board, without purchaser&#146;s written consent, will not take any action described below under the caption &#147;&#151;events requiring supermajority board approval.&#148;

during the period from the csa effective date through december 31, 2013, guarantor may not assign its rights and obligations under the credit support agreement without the prior written consent of the issuer. &#149; during the period from january 1, 2014 through june 30, 2016 (the &#147;free transfer period&#148;), total, as the initial guarantor (but not any assignee of total), may assign its rights and obligations under the credit support agreement without the prior written consent of the issuer to any entity that (a) acquires beneficial ownership of 40% or more of the combined voting power of all voting stock of the issuer and (b) is rated bbb&#43;/baa1 or better (or, if such entity does not have a current credit rating, would be rated bbb&#43;/baa1 or better, as determined by a leading investment bank retained by guarantor (subject to confirmation by a second leading investment bank retained by the issuer, at its option), based on such entity&#146;s long-term unsecured, unsubordinated debt as of the proposed assignment date taking into account the totality of the transactions pursuant to which such entity is acquiring the voting power or voting stock of the issuer and assuming the rights and obligations of guarantor under the credit support agreement. if a proposed transferee has a credit rating from both s&amp;p and moody&#146;s and has a credit rating of bbb&#43; or better by s&amp;p or baa1 or better by moody&#146;s, but not both, that proposed transferee would satisfy the requirements above if the s&amp;p and moody&#146;s credit ratings do not differ by more than one rating (for example, if the s&amp;p credit rating is bbb&#43; and the moody&#146;s credit rating is baa2, such person would satisfy the requirements above, but if the s&amp;p credit rating is bbb&#43; and the moody&#146;s credit rating is baa3, such person would not satisfy the requirements above). &#149; any assignment by guarantor will not release guarantor from its obligations to guarantee letters of credit pursuant to a letter of credit facility that is the subject of a guaranty and outstanding as of the date of the assignment, so long as the issuer continues to pay the guarantee fee relating to such letters of credit. however, guarantor may notify the banks that have issued such outstanding letters of credit that no new letters of credit may be issued under the applicable letter of credit facility and guaranteed by guarantor. &#149; in connection with an assignment during the free transfer period to an assignee that is rated lower than a by s&amp;p or a2 by moody&#146;s, guarantor may either (a) pay to the issuer an assignment fee equal to $20 million as of january 1, 2014 and reduced by $2 million per calendar quarter until reduced to zero (for example, the fee payable for an assignment on october 15, 2014 would be $14 million) or (b) agree to pay to the issuer a make-whole amount based on a calculation of the amount actually paid by the issuer to banks that are party to letter of credit facilities (both guaranteed and non-guaranteed) and to lenders in revolving credit facilities permitted under the credit support agreement in increased costs as a result of total&#146;s assignment of its rights and obligations under the credit support agreement. such make-whole amount would be payable on a quarterly basis from the assignment date through the fifth anniversary of the csa effective date. page 24 of 40 the r&amp;c agreement total and the issuer are parties to a research &amp;
