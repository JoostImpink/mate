made to the note purchase agreement, described more fully in schedule 5.9. reference is made to that warrant purchase agreement dated as of march 31, 1999 by and among the corporation, and each of the holders, pursuant to which the corporation issued and sold to the holders (i) a warrants to purchase, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, up to an aggregate of 1,527,250 shares of the corporation's common stock, (ii) b warrants to purchase, at an exercise price of $0.00025 per share, up to an aggregate of 527,514 shares of the corporation's common stock, and (iii) c warrants to purchase, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, up to an aggregate of 231,132 shares of the corporation's common stock. each of the a warrants, b warrants and c warrants (collectively, the "warrants") is exercisable on or prior to the earlier of(i) six years after the date of full payment of the senior note, or (ii) march 31, 2009. the c warrants or underlying shares of common stock may be repurchased by the corporation at $6.00 per share (less any unpaid exercise price) on an all or none basis until march 31, 2004 as long as the corporation is not in default with respect to the senior note or related agreements. the warrants may be exercised by payment of cash, cancellation of debt or on a cashless basis. the warrant purchase agreement contains provisions which provide the holders with certain antidilution protection such that prior to a qualifying public offering (proceeds of $15 million at a price of at least $5.00 per share and a valuation of at least $40 million), qualified sale (valuation of at least $40 million and minimum proceeds of $5.00 to $7.00 per share to holders) or a qualifying stock market listing (nasdaq national market or new york stock exchange and minimum price and trading volume), in the event of a sale or disposition of the corporation or substantially all of its assets, the number of shares of common stock for which the warrants may be exercised may be increased, without a corresponding increase in the aggregate consideration to provide additional consideration to the holders based on a revenue based valuation. reference is made to that shareholder agreement dated as of march 31, 1999 by and among the corporation, each of the holders, jim stein, james barnes, and jerry polis, pursuant to which the corporation (i) granted to each holder preemptive rights to purchase, pro rata, any new securities (as defined in the shareholder agreement) issued and sold by the corporation, (ii) agreed not to incur any other additional debt, other than as permitted under and pursuant to the terms of the shareholder agreement, (iii) as more fully described in articles iv and v of the shareholder agreement and below, granted to each holder certain drag-along rights and call option rights with respect to certain of the corporation's securities held by each of them, and (iv) as more fully described in the shareholder agreement, granted to each of holder certain rights of first refusal, co-sale rights and registration rights (which registration rights have been amended as set forth in the registration rights agreement and shareholder agreement amendment). furthermore, the shareholder agreement, the corporation's three directors, jim stein, james a. barnes and jerry e. polis (the "shareholders"), pledged an aggregate of 2,861,557 shares of common stock of the corporation to secure obligations related to the issuance of the senior notes and warrants. the shareholder agreement also (i) limits resales by the shareholders of their shares in the open market and, as disclosed above, grants certain first refusal and co-sale rights to the holders, and (ii) obligates the shareholders to vote their shares of common stock to elect one director each for seacoast and pacific if so designated by them. these provisions generally terminate upon completion of a qualifying public offering by the corporation, a qualifying stock market listing or the sale of 80% of the holders shares of common stock 63 underlying the warrants. in addition, the "drag-along-rights" granted under the shareholder agreement provide that until a qualifying public offering or sale is completed by the corporation or a qualifying market listing is achieved, then upon either (i) a change in control (the shareholders owning less than 20% of the corporation on a fully diluted basis), or (ii) the loss of mr. stein as president without a replacement acceptable to the holders, or (iii) a non-qualifying public offering, or (iv) certain defaults under the senior notes, and (v) at any time between april 2004 and april 2009 (unless the rights are earlier terminated), the holders may seek a buyer for the corporation or its assets and the corporation and the shareholders are obligated to cooperate and take such actions to complete a sale, consistent with their fiduciary duties. upon such a sale, the warrants may be exercised for additional shares of common stock as described above resulting in additional dilution to existing shareholders of the corporation. references is made to that stock purchase warrant issued to davric corporation dated effective june 30, 1999 pursuant to which the corporation issued davric corporation a four-year warrant to purchase up to 30,000 shares of its common stock at a per share price of $1.50 per share. reference is made to the second amendment to the shareholder agreement terminating certain "drag-along" rights. 64 schedule 5.14(b) to stock purchase agreement outstanding documents

vote on all matters submitted or required to be submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the corporation and shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which such shares of series b preferred stock are convertible pursuant to the provisions hereof, at the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on such matters or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of shareholders is solicited. in each such case, except as otherwise required by law or expressly provided herein, the holders of shares of series a stock, series b stock and common stock shall vote together and not as separate classes. 2. special voting for the election of directors. the board of

(200,000) shares of series b preferred stock are issued and outstanding (appropriately adjusted), the holders of series b preferred stock shall be entitled, voting as a separate class, to elect two

may be removed during his term of office in accordance with the business corporation act of the state of colorado, and any vacancy thereby created shall be filled as provided in this subparagraph. d. conversion. the holders of the outstanding shares of series b stock shall have the following conversion rights (the "conversion rights"): 1. right to convert. each share of series b stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such shares, at the office of this corporation or any transfer agent for the corporation's shares into that number of shares of common stock which is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $17.50 for each share of series b stock by the series b conversion price (as such term is hereinafter defined) in effect immediately prior to the time of such conversion. the initial price at which shares of common stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of shares of series b stock shall be $1.75 (as adjusted from time to time as herein provided, the "series b conversion price"). 2. mechanics of conversion. each holder of outstanding shares of series b stock who desires to convert the same into shares of common stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of this corporation or of any transfer agent for the corporation's shares and shall give written notice to this corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the number of shares of series b stock being converted. thereupon, this corporation shall issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which such holder is entitled and shall promptly pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares being converted. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be converted, and the person entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of common stock on such date. 3. adjustment for stock splits and combinations. if this corporation at any time or from time to time after the date that this certificate of designation was filed with the colorado secretary of state (the "filing date") effects a division of the outstanding shares of common stock, the series b conversion price shall be proportionately decreased and, conversely, if this corporation at any time, or from time to time, after the filing date combines the outstanding shares of common stock, the series b conversion price shall be 5 6 proportionately increased. any adjustment under this section d.3 shall be effective on the close of business on the date such division or combination becomes effective. 4. adjustment for certain dividends and distributions. if this corporation at any time or from time to time after the filing date pays or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution in the form of shares of common stock, or rights or options for the purchase of, or securities convertible into, common stock, then in each such event the series b conversion price shall be decreased, as of the time of such payment or, in the event a record date is fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the series b conversion price by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the time of such payment or the close of business on such record date and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (a) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the time of such payment or the close of business on such record date plus (b) the number of shares of common stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution or upon exercise of such option or right of conversion; provided, however, that if a record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or such other distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the series b conversion price shall not be decreased as of the close of business on such record date as hereinabove provided as to the portion not fully paid or distributed and thereafter the series b conversion price shall be decreased pursuant to this section 4 as of the date or dates of actual payment of such dividend or distribution. 5. adjustments for other dividends and distributions. if this corporation at any time or from time to time after the filing date pays, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution in the form of securities of this corporation other than shares of common stock or rights or options for the purchase of, or securities convertible into, common stock, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of outstanding shares of series b stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of common stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of this corporation that they would have received had their respective shares of series b stock been converted into shares of common stock on the date of such event and had such holders thereafter, from the date of such event to and including the actual date of conversion of their shares, retained such securities, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this section d with respect to the rights of the holders of the outstanding shares of series b stock. 6 7 6. adjustment for reclassification, exchange and substitution. if, at any time or from time to time after the filing date, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of series b stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock or other securities, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a recapitalization, division or combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this section d), then in any such event each holder of outstanding shares of series b stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of series b stock into the same kind and amount of stock and other securities receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change, as the maximum number of shares of common stock into which such shares of series b stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. 7. reorganizations, mergers, consolidations or sales of assets. if, at any time or from time to time after the filing date, there is a capital reorganization of the common stock (other than a recapitalization, division, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this section d) or a merger or consolidation of this corporation into or with another corporation or a sale of all or substantially all of this corporation's properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of outstanding shares of series b stock shall thereafter receive upon conversion thereof the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of this corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which their shares of series b stock were convertible would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section d with respect to the rights of the holders of the outstanding shares of series b stock after the capital reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale to the end that the provisions of this section d (including adjustment of the series b conversion price and the number of shares into which the shares of series b stock may be converted) shall be applicable after that event and be as nearly equivalent to such

(iv) for the purpose of any adjustment required under this section d.8, if (a) this corporation issues or sells any rights or options for the purchase of convertible securities and (b) if the effective price of the additional shares of common stock underlying such convertible securities is less than the series b conversion price, then in each such event this corporation shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such rights or options the maximum number of additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the total number of convertible securities covered by such rights or options (as set forth in the legal instruments setting forth the terms of such convertible securities) and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such additional shares of common stock an amount equal to the amount of consideration, if any, received for the issuance of such rights or options plus (a) the minimum amount of consideration, if any, payable upon the exercise of such rights or options and (b) the minimum amount of consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion of such convertible securities. no further adjustment of the series b conversion price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of the convertible securities upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon the actual issuance of additional shares of common stock upon the conversion of such convertible securities. the provisions of section d.8.(iii) for the adjustment of the series b conversion price upon the expiration of rights or options or the rights of conversion of convertible securities shall apply mutatis mutandis upon the expiration of the rights, options and convertible securities referred to in this clause d.8.(iv).

(e) securities issued to or in connection with an arrangement or venture with a strategic partner of the company, provided such issuance is unanimously approved by the board of directors; (f) shares of common stock or preferred stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of any warrants, options or other rights that are outstanding as of the filing date (or issued or issuable after the reissuance of any such expired or terminated options, warrants or rights and net of any such issued shares repurchased by the corporation);

stock into which the surrendered shares of series b stock of such holder were convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred. 12 13 12. fractional shares. no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of the shares of series b stock. in lieu of any fractional share to which the holder of such shares would otherwise be entitled, the corporation shall pay

otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the corporation shall be authorized to issue." 13 ex-99.7 4 investor rights agreement

(b) registration fees; (c) printing expenses; (d) accounting fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of one special counsel to the selling holders not to exceed $25,000 (except that if in the reasonable written opinion of counsel for either the holders of a majority of the registrable series a securities or registrable series b securities, there exists a material conflict of interest between such two groups of holders, then each such group may be represented by separate counsel with each counsel reimbursed for fees and expenses not to exceed $25,000); (e) expenses of any special audits or comfort letters incident to or required by any such registration or qualification; and (f) expenses of complying with the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdictions in connection with such registration or qualification. notwithstanding the foregoing, each holder will severally bear the expense of its underwriting fees, discounts, or commissions relating to its sale of registrable securities in all such registrations. g. listing on securities exchange. if the company lists any shares of capital stock on any securities exchange or on the national association of securities dealers, inc. automated quotation system or similar system, it will, at its expense, list thereon, maintain and, when necessary, increase such listing of, all registrable securities. h. holdback agreements. (i) if any registration pursuant to section 2.b is in connection with an underwritten public offering, each holder of registrable securities agrees, if so required by the managing underwriter, not to effect any public sale or distribution of registrable securities (other than as part of such underwritten public offering) during the period beginning seven (7) days prior to the effective date of such registration statement and ending on the one hundred eightieth (180th) day after the effective date of such registration statement; provided, however, that jim stein and each person that is an officer, director, or 11 beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock enters into such an agreement. (ii) the company agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution during the period seven (7) days (or such longer period as may be prescribed by regulation m) prior to the effective date of the registration statement employed in any underwritten public offering and ending on the one hundred eightieth (180th) day after any such registration statement contemplated by sections 2.a. or 2.c. has become effective, except as part of such underwritten public offering pursuant to such registration statement and except pursuant to securities registered on forms s-4 or s-8 of the commission or any successor forms, and the company agrees to use its best efforts to cause each holder of its equity securities or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of such securities, in each case purchased from the company at any time after the date of this agreement (other than in a public offering), to agree not to effect any such public sale or distribution of such securities during such period. i. rule 144. at all times following completion by the company of a public offering, the company will take such action as any holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell shares of registrable securities without registration pursuant to and in accordance with (a) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation adopted by the commission. upon the request of any holder of registrable securities, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. j. rule 144a. the company agrees that, upon the request of any holder or any prospective purchaser of registrable securities designated by a holder, the company will promptly provide (but in any case within fifteen (15) days of a request) to such holder or potential purchaser, the following publicly available information: (i) a brief statement of the nature of the business of the company and any subsidiaries and the products and services they offer; (ii) the most recent consolidated balance sheets and profit and losses and retained earnings statements, and similar financial statements of the company for such part of the two preceding fiscal years prior to such request as the company has been in operation (such financial information will be audited, to the extent reasonably available); and 12 (iii) such other publicly available information about the company, any subsidiaries, and their business, financial condition, and results of operations as the requesting holder or purchaser of such warrants requests in order to comply with rule 144a, as amended, and the antifraud provisions of the federal and state securities laws. the company hereby represents and warrants to any such requesting holder and any prospective purchaser of warrants or warrant shares from such holder that the information provided by the company pursuant to this section 2.j. will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. k. limitations on subsequent registration rights. until (i) a qualified liquidity milestone, (ii) a qualified liquidation event (as each is defined in the company's series a convertible preferred stock certificate of designation filed with the colorado secretary of state) (iii) the repayment of any and all senior obligations owed to such noteholder and the sale in excess of 80% of such noteholder's common stock shares and other securities issued or issuable under the warrants from and after the date of this agreement or until the provisions of section 2.d. are applicable, the company will not, without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding registrable securities, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company that would allow such holder or prospective holder (a) to include such securities in any registration filed under section 2.a., unless under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of its securities will not reduce the amount of the registrable securities of the holders that is included or (b) to make a demand registration that could result in such registration statement being declared effective prior to the effectiveness of the first registration statement effected under section 2.a. or within one hundred twenty (120) days of the effective date of any registration effected pursuant to section 2.a.. l. right to delay a demand registration. if, at the time of any request to register registrable securities hereunder, the company is preparing a registration statement for a public offering (other than a registration effected solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a transaction to which rule 145 of the commission is applicable) and such registration statement in fact is filed and becomes effective within ninety (90) days after the request, then the company may at its option delay such request for a period not more than in excess of one hundred twenty 13 (120) days from the effective date of such offering or the date of commencement of such other activity, as the case may be. such right to delay shall be exercised by the company not more than once in any twelve (12) month period. nothing in this section 2.l. shall preclude a holder of registrable securities from enjoying registration rights which it might otherwise possess under this this agreement. m. indemnification (i) indemnification by holders of registrable securities. each holder of any registrable securities shall, by acceptance thereof, indemnify and hold harmless each other holder of any registrable securities, the company, its directors and officers, each above-described underwriter who contracts with the company or its agents and each other person, if any, who controls the company or such underwriter, against any liability, joint or several, to which any such other holder, the company, underwriter or any such director or officer of any such person may become subject under the securities act or any other statute or at common law, if such liability (or actions in respect hereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) the disposition by such holder of such registrable securities in violation of the provisions of this agreement, (ii) any alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which securities were registered under the securities act at the request of such holder, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (iii) any alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make statement(s) therein not misleading. notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the indemnification rights set forth in this section shall be given in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) only if such alleged untrue statement or alleged omission supplement thereto was made (1) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder under an instrument executed by such holder expressly stated for use therein, and (2) not based on the authority of an expert as to whom the holder had no reasonable ground to believe, and did not believe, that (a) the statements made on the authority of such expert were untrue or (b) there was an omission to state a material fact. such holder shall reimburse the company, such underwriter or such director, officer, other person or other holder for any reasonable legal fees incurred in investigating or defending any such liability if it is judicially determined that the information furnished by such holder contains an untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading; provided, however, that no holder of registrable securities shall be required to 14 indemnify any person against any liability arising from any untrue or misleading statement or omission contained in any prospectus or for any liability which arises out of the failure of any person to deliver a prospectus as required by the securities act; and provided further, that the obligations of such holder of registrable securities for the indemnity hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds received by such holder of registrable securities upon disposition thereof and shall not extend to any settlement of claims related thereto without the express written consent of such holder of registrable securities, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (ii) indemnification by the company. in the event of any registration of any of the registrable shares under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, then to the extent permitted by law the company shall indemnify and hold harmless the seller of such registrable shares, each underwriter of such registrable shares and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such seller, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act, state securities laws or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such registrable shares were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained in the registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to such registration statement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading; and the company shall reimburse such seller, underwriter and each such controlling person for reasonable legal or any other expenses incurred by such seller, underwriter or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or omission made in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus or prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the company, in writing, by or on behalf of such seller, underwriter or controlling person specifically for use in the preparation thereof. or (ii) on the authority of an "expert" within 15 the meaning of that term as defined in the securities act (but only if the company had no reasonable ground to believe, and did not believe, that the statements made on the authority of such expert were untrue or that there was an omission to state a material fact). the company shall not be required to indemnify any person against any liability arising from (i) any untrue or misleading statement or omission contained in any preliminary prospectus if such deficiency is corrected in the final prospectus or (ii) for any liability which arises out of the failure of any person to deliver a prospectus as required by the securities act. n. nominees for beneficial owners/transfers. in the event that any registrable securities are held by a nominee for the beneficial owner of such registrable securities, the beneficial owner of registrable securities may, at its election, be treated as the holder of such registrable securities for purposes of any request or other action by any holder or holders of registrable securities pursuant to this agreement or any determination of any number or percentage of shares of registrable securities held by any holder or holders of registrable securities contemplated by this agreement. if the beneficial owner of any registrable securities so elects, the company may require assurances reasonably satisfactory to it of such owner's beneficial ownership of such registrable securities. in no event will a holder be required to exercise the warrant as a condition to the registration of such warrant or registrable securities thereunder. the registration rights set forth in this section 2 are only assignable by each original holder hereunder to each assignee of no less than the lesser of all of holder's registrable securities held as of the date hereof or at least one hundred thousand (100,000) registrable securities conveyed in accordance herewith (appropriately adjusted in all cases for stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like), provided that such assignee promptly agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. 3. preemptive rights. a. equity preemptive right. the company will not issue or sell any capital stock (other than any series b stock, or other than any securities that, with the unanimous consent of the company's board of directors, are not issued to any existing shareholder of the company or other than any such other equity or any such rights to acquire equity which are excluded from the definition of "additional shares of common stock" under the company's series b convertible preferred stock certificate of designation (including any options or other convertible securities exercisable for shares excluded from such definition)) (the "new securities") without first 16 complying with this section 3. the company hereby grants to each of seacoast, pacific, tangent and each holder of at least 20% of the registrable series b securities originally outstanding (each a "preemptive right holder") the preemptive right to purchase, pro rata, any part of the new securities that the company may, from time to time, propose to sell or issue. in the event new securities are offered or sold as part of a unit with other new securities, the preemptive right granted by this section3 will apply to such units and not to the individual new securities composing such units. each holder's pro rata share for purposes of section 3 is the ratio that the number of shares of common stock owned by such holder immediately prior to the issuance of the new securities bears to the sum of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding. any payment due from holder in connection with the exercise of the preemptive right granted pursuant to this section 3.a may be satisfied, at the option of the holder, by (i) cancellation of any debt and/or accrued interest owed by the company to the holder or (ii) cancellation of warrant shares, valued at fair market value. b. debt preemptive right. the company will not incur any additional debt other than the debt due under the note or any permitted indebtedness, (as defined in the note agreement) without first complying with this section 3 and section 12.15 of the note agreement. c. notice to preemptive right holders. (i) in the event the company proposes to issue or sell new securities, it will give each preemptive right holder written notice of its intention, describing the type of new securities and the price and terms upon which the company proposes to issue or sell the new securities. each preemptive right holder will have fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of any such notice and such information as the preemptive right holder may reasonably request to facilitate its investment decision to agree to purchase up to its respective pro rata share of the new securities for the price (valued at fair market value for any noncash consideration) and upon the terms specified in the notice by giving written notice to the company stating the quantity of new securities agreed to be purchased. (ii) in the event the company proposes to incur additional debt to which section 3.b above (but not section 3.a above)would apply (the "new financing"), the company shall first offer to each of seacoast, pacific and tangent, on a pari passu and pro rata basis, based upon the principal amount of the senior obligations outstanding to such 17 parties (except that if the senior obligations have been paid in full, based upon the amount of capital stock owned by such parties), the right to provide all or any part of the new financing proposed to be incurred, on the most favorable terms for lender(s) to be providing such new financing. such offer shall describe the new financing in reasonable detail. thereafter, each such party shall have fifteen (15) days in which to accept the company's offer and closing of the transaction shall take place within sixty (60) days of acceptance. if any such holder does not accept the offer or accepts only a part of it, such holder shall notify the company and the other two holders, and the other two holders shall thereupon have the right, within an additional ten (10) day period, to agree to provide on a pro rata basis the new financing not so provided by the non-accepting holder, and closing of such transaction shall take place within sixty (60) days of acceptance. if no such holder accepts the offer, or if each such holder elects to provide only a part of the new financing offered, then the company may then offer to third parties such new financing, or a portion thereof not provided by any such holder, on terms and conditions no more favorable to the lenders thereof than those provided by, or offered to, such holders, provided that any such funding occurs within one hundred eighty (180) days of such holders' non-acceptance or partial acceptance of the company's original offer. any new financing thereafter must first be reoffered to each of seacoast, pacific and tangent under the terms of this section 3.c(ii). d. allocation of unsubscribed new securities. in the event a preemptive right holder fails to exercise such equity preemptive right in full within such fifteen (15) day period, the other preemptive right holders, if any, will have an additional five (5) day period to purchase such holder's portion not so agreed to be purchased in the same proportion in which such other holders were entitled to purchase the new securities (excluding for such purposes such nonpurchasing holder). thereafter, the company will have ninety (90) days to sell the new securities not elected to be purchased by the preemptive right holders at the same price and upon the same terms specified in the company's notice described in section 3.c(i). in the event the company has not sold the new securities within such ninety (90) day period, the company will not thereafter issue or sell any new securities without first offering such securities in the manner provided above. 18 e. termination of preemptive rights. the rights granted pursuant to this section 3 shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) a qualified liquidation event or (ii) a qualified liquidity milestone. 4. miscellaneous. a. headings. the headings in this agreement are for convenience and reference only and are not part of the substance of this agreement. b. severability. the parties to this agreement expressly agree that it is not their intention to violate any public policy, statutory or common law rules, regulations, or decisions of any governmental or regulatory body. if any provision of this agreement is judicially or administratively interpreted or construed as being in violation of any such policy, rule, regulation, or decision, the provision, section, sentence, word, clause, or combination thereof causing such violation will be inoperative (and in lieu thereof there will be inserted such provision, sentence, word, clause, or combination thereof as may be valid and consistent with the intent of the parties under this agreement) and the remainder of this agreement, as amended, will remain binding upon the parties to this agreement, unless the inoperative provision would cause enforcement of the remainder of this agreement to be inequitable under the circumstances. c. notices. whenever it is provided herein that any notice, demand, request, consent, approval, declaration, or other communication be given to or served upon any of the parties by another, such notice, demand, request, consent, approval, declaration, or other communication will be in writing
