(e) if, at any time during which the company has the obligation to keep effective the continuous offering registration statement contemplated by section 2(a) hereof, the company becomes aware of the happening of any event or discovers any facts during the period such continuous offering registration statement is effective that (i) makes any statement made in such continuous offering registration statement or the related prospectus untrue in any material respect or (ii) causes such continuous offering registration statement or the related prospectus to omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the company will use its reasonable efforts to prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to such continuous offering registration statement or the related prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the stockholders, such prospectus will not contain at the time of such delivery any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. the company agrees to notify each stockholder to -3- suspend use of the prospectus as promptly as practicable after an appropriate officer or employee of the company becomes aware of the occurrence of such an event, and each stockholder hereby agrees to suspend use of the prospectus until the company has amended or supplemented the prospectus to correct such misstatement or omission or has advised such stockholders that use of such prospectus may be resumed. at such time as public disclosure is otherwise made or the company determines that such disclosure is not necessary, in each case to correct any misstatement of a material fact or to include any omitted material fact, or the company otherwise determines that use of such prospectus may be resumed, the company agrees to promptly notify each stockholder of such determination and (if applicable) to furnish each such stockholder such numbers of copies of the prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as such stockholder may reasonably request. the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with the registration of registrable securities pursuant to this section 2, and each shareholder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such shareholder's registrable securities pursuant to a continuous offering. section 3. underwritten offering registration rights. (a) if the company proposes to register, at any time during which holders of registrable securities hold in the aggregate more than 200,000 shares of common stock and such shares of common stock have not become saleable under rule 144 (or any similar provisions) of the securities act, any common stock under the securities act (other than a registration on form s-8 or any successor or similar forms, relating to common stock issuable upon exercise of employee stock options or in conjunction with an employee benefit plan or similar plan of the company or any of its subsidiaries), in a manner which would permit registration of the registrable securities for sale to the public under the securities act pursuant to an underwritten public offering (the "underwritten offering"), it will at such time give prompt written notice (the "underwritten registration notice") to all holders of record of registrable securities of its intention to do so (including the intended method of disposition), and of such shareholders' rights under this section 3, at least 30 days prior to the anticipated filing date of the registration statement relating to such registration (the "underwritten offering registration statement"). any such notice shall offer all of the holders of registrable securities the opportunity to include in such underwritten offering registration statement such number of common stock as each such shareholder may request. upon the written request of any such shareholder made within 10 days after the receipt of notice from the company (which request shall specify the number of common stock intended to be disposed of by such shareholder), the company will use its best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of all registrable securities which the company has been so requested to register by the shareholders thereof, to the extent necessary to permit disposition of the registrable securities so to be registered in accordance with the company's intended method of disposition; provided that (i) all shareholders of registrable securities requesting to be included in the company's registration must sell their registrable securities so requested to be included, to the underwriters selected by the company on the same terms and conditions as apply to the company, and (ii) if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities pursuant to this section 3 and prior to the effective date of the underwritten offering registration statement, the company shall determine for any reason not to proceed with the underwritten offering, the company shall give written -4- notice to all shareholders of registrable securities and, thereupon, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration. the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with the registration of registrable securities pursuant to this section 3, and each shareholder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such shareholder's registrable securities pursuant to an underwritten offering. (b) if the managing underwriter of an underwritten offering registration pursuant to this section 3 advises the company that, in its view, the number of securities (including all registrable securities) which the company, the shareholders and any other persons intended to include in such registration exceeds the maximum offering size, the company will include registrable securities and other securities in such registration, in the following priority, up to the maximum offering size: (i) first, one million (1,000,000) shares shall be registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the shareholders pursuant to section 3(a) hereof (allocated, if necessary for the offering not to exceed the offering size, or for the number of shares of registrable securities not to exceed 1,000,000 shares, pro rata among the shareholders requesting registration of such registrable securities pursuant to section 3(a) hereof based upon the relative number of shares of common stock then owned by each such shareholder that has requested to be included in such registration); provided, however, that if the underwritten registration notice is given to the holders of registrable securities at a time when such holders have had the opportunity to sell at least one million (1,000,000) shares of registrable securities in an underwritten offering, then the company will no longer be obligated to provide the holders of registrable securities with the first priority in such underwritten offering and the company may instead provide the holders of registrable securities with the inclusion priority set forth in section 3(b)(iii), below; (ii) second, the securities proposed to be included by the company; and (iii) third, the securities requested to be included by any other persons pursuant to piggyback registration rights possessed by such persons together with the registrable securities in excess of one million shares which have been requested to be included in such registration by the shareholders pursuant to section 3(a) hereof (allocated, if necessary for the offering not to exceed the offering size, pro rata among the other people possessing piggyback registration rights and the shareholders requesting registration of such registrable securities, based upon the relative number of shares of common stock then owned by each such shareholder or other person that has requested to be included in such registration). (c) until the earlier of (i) such time as the number of registrable securities is less that two hundred thousand (200,000) shares, or (ii) the date on which the registrable securities are first saleable under rule 144 (or any similar provision) of the securities act, which is 24 months after the date of this agreement, the company shall not enter into any agreement with any holder of any securities of the company providing for the granting to such holder of registration rights unless such agreement includes a provision that conflicts with the priority provisions of section 3(b) hereof. -5- (d) upon the filing of an underwritten offering registration statement, the company shall have the right to withdraw or suspend use of any continuous offering registration statement which has previously been filed and is not yet effective with the commission. (e) upon the delivery by the company of the underwritten registration notice, the company's obligation to proceed with the continuous offering shall be suspended until the earlier of (i) such time as the company shall determine not to proceed with the underwritten offering, (ii) the time required to complete the underwritten offering including any applicable lockup period thereafter, or (iii) 145 days from the date of the underwritten registration notice (the "suspension termination date"). if the shareholders own any registrable securities on the suspension termination date and none of such securities are saleable under rule 144 (or any similar provisions) of the securities act, then the company shall file a continuous offering registration statement within ten days after the suspension termination date and shall cause such continuous offering registration statement to become effective on or before 45 days after the suspension termination date and the provisions of sections 2(c), 2(d) and 2(e) herein shall apply to such continuous offering. the foregoing notwithstanding, the company shall cause a continuous offering registration statement to become effective by october 31, 1996, in the event that no underwritten offering registration statement has become effective before such date. section 4 indemnification. (a) subject to the conditions set forth below, the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each stockholder from and against any and all loss, liability, charge, claim, damage, and expense whatsoever (which shall include, for all purposes of this section 4, but not be limited to, attorneys' fees and any and all expense whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing, or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), as and when incurred, arising out of, based upon, or in connection with (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (a) in any registration statement, preliminary prospectus, or final prospectus (as from time to time amended and supplemented), or any amendment or supplement thereto, relating to the sale of any of the registrable securities, or (b) in any application or other document or communication (in this section 4 collectively called an "application") executed by or on behalf of the company or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the company filed in any jurisdiction in order to register or qualify any of the registrable securities under the securities or blue sky laws thereof or filed with the commission or any securities exchange; or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, unless such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company with respect to the stockholders by or on behalf of such person expressly for inclusion in any registration statement, preliminary prospectus, or final prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, as the case may be, or (ii) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the company contained in this agreement. the foregoing agreement to indemnify shall be in addition to any -6- liability the company may otherwise have, including liabilities arising under this agreement. if any action is brought against any of the stockholders (an "indemnified party") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the company pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, such indemnified party or parties shall promptly notify the company in writing of the institution of such action (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve the company from any liability other than pursuant to this section 4(a)), and the company shall promptly assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel (reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or parties) and payment of expenses. such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the company in connection with the defense of such action or the company shall not have promptly employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or parties to have charge of the defense of such action or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it or them or to other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the company, in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the company and the company shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties. anything in this section 4 to the contrary notwithstanding, the company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such claim or action effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. the company shall not, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party that is not released as described in this sentence, settle or compromise any action, or permit a default or consent to the entry of judgment in, or otherwise seek to terminate, any pending or threatened action, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified party is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise, consent, or termination includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability in respect of such action. the company agrees promptly to notify the stockholders of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the company or any of its officers or directors in connection with the sale of any registrable securities or any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, registration statement, or amendment or supplement thereto, or any application relating to any sale of any registrable securities. (b) each stockholder, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, each director of the company, each officer of the company who shall have signed any registration statement covering registrable securities held by the stockholders, each other person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of section 15 of the act or section 20(a) of the exchange act, and its or their respective counsel, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to the stockholders in section 4(a), but only with respect to statements or omissions, if any, made in any registration statement, preliminary prospectus, or final prospectus (as from time to time amended and supplemented), or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company with respect to the stockholders by or on behalf of the stockholders expressly for inclusion in any such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, or final prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, as the case may be. if any action shall be -7- brought against the company or any other person so indemnified based on any such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, or final prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a stockholder pursuant to this section 4(b), such stockholder shall have the rights and duties given to the company, and the company and each other person so indemnified shall have the rights and duties given to the indemnified parties, by the provisions of section 4(a). notwithstanding the foregoing, no stockholder shall be required to indemnify the company under this section 4(b) for any amount in excess of the gross proceeds received by said stockholder in a sale or sales of registrable securities under this agreement. (c) to provide for just and equitable contribution, if (i) an indemnified party makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to section 4(a) or 4(b) (subject to the limitations thereof) but it is found in a final judicial determination, not subject to further appeal, that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case, even though this agreement expressly provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) any indemnified or indemnifying party seeks contribution under the act, the exchange act, or otherwise, then the company (including for this purpose any contribution made by or on behalf of any director of the company, any officer of the company who signed any such registration statement, any controlling person of the company, and its or their respective counsel), as one entity, and the stockholders, as a second entity, shall contribute to all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses whatsoever to which any of them may be subject, on the basis of relevant equitable considerations such as the relative fault of the company and the stockholders in connection with the facts which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses. the relative fault, in the case of an untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission, or alleged omission, shall be determined by, among other things, whether such statement, alleged statement, omission, or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the company or by the stockholders, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, alleged statement, omission, or alleged omission. the company and each of the stockholders agree that it would be unjust and inequitable if the respective obligations of the company and the stockholders for contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation of the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses (even if the stockholders and the other indemnified parties were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not reflect the equitable considerations referred to in this section 4(c). no person guilty of a fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. for purposes of this section 4(c), each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of section 15 of the act or section 20(a) of the exchange act, each officer of the company who shall have signed any such registration statement, each director of the company, and its or their respective counsel shall have the same rights to contribution as the company, subject in each case to the provisions of this section 4(c). anything in this section 4(c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no party shall be liable for contribution with respect to the settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent. this section 4(c) is intended to supersede any right to contribution under the act, the exchange act, or otherwise. -8- section 5. assignment of registration rights. rights under this agreement may be assigned by the stockholders to transferees or assignees of the stockholders' registrable securities; provided, however, that the company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the registrable securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned; provided, further, that such assignment shall be effective only if, immediately following such transfer or assignment, the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the act. the term "stockholder" or "stockholders" as used in this agreement includes permitted assignees of rights under this agreement in accordance with this section 5. section 6. lock-up agreement. each of the stockholders hereby agrees that, if the company prepares and files a registration statement with the commission relating to the offer and sale of securities for the company's account on an underwritten basis during the period in which the company has the obligation to keep effective the registration statement contemplated by section 3(a) hereof, then upon request of the underwriters managing such offering, such stockholder will enter into a lock-up agreement with the managing underwriters providing that such stockholder will not sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any registrable securities without the prior written consent of such underwriters until 90 days following the closing of the offering covered by the registration statement filed for the company's account. section 7. furnish information. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to this agreement with respect to any stockholder that such stockholder shall furnish to the company such information regarding itself, the registrable securities held by it, and the intended method of distribution of such securities as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of the registrable securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the company may reasonably request. section 8. miscellaneous. (a) a copy of this agreement shall be filed with the secretary of the company. (b) the provisions of this agreement shall be deemed to apply equally to the registrable securities or other securities distributed in respect of the registrable securities. (c) at any time and from time to time each party agrees, at its or his expense, to take such actions and to execute and deliver such documents as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this agreement. (d) since a breach of the provisions of this agreement could not adequately be compensated by money damages, any party shall be entitled, in addition to any other right or remedy available to him or it, to an injunction restraining such breach or a threatened breach and to specific performance of any such provision of this agreement, and in either -9- case no bond or other security shall be required in connection therewith, and the parties hereby consent to such injunction and to the ordering of specific performance. (e) any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by federal express, express mail, or similar overnight delivery or courier service or delivered (in person or by telecopy, telex, or similar telecommunications equipment) against receipt to the party to whom it is to be given, (i) if to the company, at 3501 frontage road, tampa, florida 33607, attention: james k. murray, jr., (ii) if to a stockholder, at his address on the signature page of this agreement, (iii) if to a transferee of a stockholder, at such transferee's address set forth in the notice of transfer, or (iv) in any case, to such other address as the party shall have furnished in writing in accordance with this section 8(e). any notice or other communication given by certified mail shall be deemed given at the time of certification thereof, except for a notice changing a party's address which shall be deemed given at the time of receipt thereof. any notice given by other means permitted by this section 8(e) shall be deemed given at the time of receipt thereof. (f) this agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, supersedes all existing agreements among them concerning such subject matter, and may be amended only by a written instrument executed by the company and by the stockholders. (g) this agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of each indemnified party under section 4. (h) any waiver by any party of a breach of any provision of this agreement shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this agreement. the failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this agreement on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this agreement. (i) if any provision of this agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the balance of this agreement shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other persons and circumstances. (j) this agreement shall terminate on such date as the stockholders own no registrable securities, provided that nothing herein shall affect any rights or obligations which arise prior to such termination or under section 4 hereof. (k) the headings in this agreement are solely for convenience of reference and shall be given no effect in the construction or interpretation of this agreement. (l) any masculine personal pronoun shall be considered to mean the corresponding feminine or neuter personal pronoun, as the context requires. -10- (m) this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware, without regard to principals of conflict of law thereunder.

plan and agreement of merger (the "agreement"), made this day 28 of may, 1996, is entered into by and among healthplan services corporation, a delaware corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "purchaser"), healthplan services alpha corporation, a delaware corporation (the "merger subsidiary"), and harrington services corporation, a delaware corporation (the "company") and robert chefitz as shareholders' representative. w i t n e s s e t h : whereas, the respective boards of directors of purchaser and the company have approved the merger (the "merger") of the company with and into the merger subsidiary in accordance with the delaware general corporation law (the "act"), with the effect that the company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of purchaser. now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises, representations, warranties and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: i. definitions. the capitalized terms used herein will have the meanings ascribed to them in exhibit 1.1 hereto. unless the context otherwise requires, such capitalized terms will include the singular and plural and the term "including" shall mean "including but not limited to." wherever in this agreement reference is made to the knowledge of the company it means the individual knowledge of the company's officers, directors and employees. ii. covenants and undertakings. 2.1 the merger. at the effective time and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and the act, the company will be merged with and into the merger subsidiary in the merger, the separate corporate existence of the company shall thereupon cease, and the merger subsidiary shall be the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation") which, effective with the effective time, shall change its name to harrington services corporation. 2.2 effective time of merger. the merger shall become effective at the time on the closing date (the "effective time") of filing of the certificate of merger with the department of state of the state of delaware in accordance with the provisions of the act. 2.3 effects of merger. subject to the act, at the effective time, the merger shall have the following effects: 2.3.1 conversion of shares. at the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of purchaser or the company: 2.3.1.1 each share of merger subsidiary common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall remain outstanding; 2.3.1.2 each share of company common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for dissenting shares, shall be converted into the right to receive: (i) the per share stock consideration, plus (ii) the per share initial cash payment, plus (iii) the per share escrow proceeds, if any; provided that (x) no fractional shares of purchaser's common stock shall be issued and any holder who would otherwise have received a fractional share of purchaser's common stock shall have a right to receive cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the market price, and (y) no shareholder shall be entitled to receive any part of the foregoing consideration until he has delivered to the purchaser (i) certificates representing all of his capital stock of the company duly endorsed in blank with signatures guaranteed by a national or state bank located in the united states or by an nasd registered brokerage firm, and (ii) either a duly executed shareholders agreement or private placement representation letter; 2.3.1.3 except for dissenting shares, each share of preferred stock, shall be converted into the per share preferred stock consideration, provided that no shareholder shall be entitled to receive any part of the foregoing consideration until he has delivered to the purchaser certificates representing all of his capital stock of the company duly endorsed in blank with signatures guaranteed by a national or state bank located in the united states or by an nasd registered brokerage firm; 2.3.1.4 each outstanding certificate representing shares of company common stock and preferred stock, except for dissenting shares, shall be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence only the right to receive upon surrender of such certificate the consideration into which such shares of company common stock or preferred stock are convertible; and 2.3.1.5 each share of company common stock that is owned by the company immediately prior to the effective time as treasury stock will be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, without any conversion thereof. 2 2.3.1.6 notwithstanding anything in this section 2.3 to the contrary, shares of company common stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and which are held by stockholders who have not voted such shares in favor of the merger and who shall have properly exercised their rights of appraisal for such shares in the manner provided by the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl") (the "dissenting shares") shall not be converted or exchangeable for the right to receive the merger consideration set forth herein, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his right to appraisal and payment, as the case may be. if such stockholder shall have failed to so perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, his shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the effective time, the right to receive the merger consideration set forth herein without any interest thereupon. the company shall give the purchaser prompt notice of any dissenting shares (and shall also give the purchaser prompt notice of any withdrawals of such demands for appraisal rights) and the purchaser shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. the company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the purchaser, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal rights. 2.3.2 certificate of incorporation. at the effective time, the certificate of incorporation of the merger subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall remain in effect as the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by law. 2.3.3 bylaws. the bylaws of the merger subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be the bylaws of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by law. 2.3.4 directors. the directors of the merger subsidiary immediately prior to the effective time shall be the directors of the surviving corporation and shall hold office from the effective time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation, or as otherwise provided by law. 2.3.5 officers. the officers of the merger subsidiary immediately prior to the effective time shall be the officers of the surviving corporation and shall hold office from the effective time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation, or as otherwise provided by law. 3 2.4 purchase price adjustment. within 45 days of the closing date, the purchaser will deliver to the shareholders' representative and the escrow agent the closing balance sheet together with the statement of net worth derived therefrom, which shall contain a calculation of the negative or positive purchase price adjustment amount, as the case may be. the closing balance sheet shall be prepared in accordance with gaap consistently applied with prior periods and shall include as accrued payables all bonuses and unpaid compensation, including but not limited to bonuses due executives under the company's executive bonus plan. additionally, the closing balance sheet shall include all liabilities of the company includable thereon under gaap consistently applied with prior periods, including but not limited to any such liabilities discovered after closing but prior to the delivery of the closing balance sheet which if known on the closing date would have been so included. the foregoing notwithstanding, the closing balance sheet shall not show under any circumstances intangible assets in an amount in excess of twenty-three million six hundred thousand dollars ($23,600,000.00) and to the extent that intangible assets of the company on the closing date exceed $23,600,000, they shall be disallowed and not taken into account on the final closing balance sheet. for purposes of the foregoing the term "intangible assets" shall mean those assets historically categorized as intangible assets by the company in accordance with gaap applied on a consistent basis, as shown on the company's audited annual financial statements under the headings "other intangibles net" and "software net." upon delivery of the closing balance sheet and the statement of net worth, the purchaser shall give the shareholders' representative and any independent auditors and authorized representatives of the shareholders' representative full access at all reasonable times to the properties, books, records and personnel of the company relating to periods prior to the closing date for purposes of reviewing and resolving any disputes concerning the closing balance sheet and the statement of net worth. the shareholders' representative shall have 30 days following the delivery by purchaser of the closing balance sheet and the statement of net worth during which to notify the purchaser of any dispute of any item contained therein, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. if the shareholders' representative fails to notify the purchaser of any such dispute within such 30-day period, the closing balance sheet and the statement of net worth provided by the purchaser shall be final, conclusive and binding and shall be deemed to be the "final closing balance sheet" and the "final statement of net worth." in the event that the shareholders' representative shall so notify the purchaser of any dispute, the purchaser and the shareholders' representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable. if the purchaser and the shareholders' representative are unable to resolve any such dispute within 15 days of the shareholders' representative's delivery of such notice, such dispute shall be resolved by the settlement auditor at the option of either the purchaser or the shareholders' representative. the settlement auditor shall make such revisions to the closing balance sheet and statement of net worth as it deems appropriate in order to make a determination of the net worth 4 amount in accordance with the foregoing provisions as promptly as practicable. such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is enforceable pursuant to all terms of the federal arbitration act, 9 u.s.c. ss.ss. 1 et seq. (the "federal arbitration act"). the expenses relating to the engagement of the settlement auditor shall be paid in equal parts by the purchaser and from the escrow. in the event of a dispute, the closing balance sheet and statement of net worth, as modified by the settlement auditor shall be the "final closing balance sheet" and the "final statement of net worth." 2.4.1 upon determination of the final closing balance sheet, if the net worth amount is less than the target net worth amount, the purchaser shall be paid from the escrow cash in the amount of one dollar for each dollar that the net worth amount as of the closing date shown on the statement of net worth is less than such target net worth amount (the "negative purchase price adjustment amount"). 2.4.2 upon determination of the final closing balance sheet and the final statement of net worth, if the net worth amount of the company as shown on the final statement of net worth is more than the target net worth amount (a "positive purchase price adjustment amount"), the purchaser shall issue to each shareholder an additional number of shares of the purchaser's common stock determined by first dividing the positive purchase price adjustment amount plus interest earned thereon since the closing at the interest rate earned on the escrow amount, by the market price, then dividing the result thereof by the company's outstanding shares, and then multiplying the result thereof by the number of company shares owned by each such shareholder immediately prior to the effective time; provided that any fractional shares resulting therefrom shall be paid in cash in the same manner set forth in section 2.3.1.2 hereof and the aggregate number of shares issued to all of the shareholders pursuant to this section 2.4.2 shall never be more than 75,000 shares of the purchaser's common stock. 2.5 hsr act filings. as promptly as practicable after the execution of this agreement, and in any event not later than the fourteenth (14) business day following the date of this agreement, purchaser and the company shall, in cooperation with each other, make the required filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement under the hsr act with the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice, and, as promptly as practicable from time to time thereafter, each party shall make all such further filings and submissions, and take such further action, as may be required in connection therewith. purchaser and the company shall each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to such filings. each party shall furnish the other all information in its possession necessary for compliance by the other with the provisions of this section 2.5. purchaser and the company shall 5 each notify the other immediately upon receiving any request for additional information with respect to such filings from either the antitrust division of the department of justice or the federal trade commission and the party receiving the request shall use its best efforts to comply with such request as soon as possible. neither party shall withdraw any such filing or submission without the written consent of the other party. 2.6 compliance with securities laws, registration rights and cooperation with post-closing audit. 2.6.1 in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement, the parties hereto agree to cooperate with one another in complying with the provisions of the 1933 act and the general rules and regulations thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state securities laws, and each of them agrees to furnish the other, or its counsel, with such information and to take such actions, as may be reasonably requested in respect of such compliance. at the closing the purchaser will enter into registration rights agreements in substantially the form of exhibit 2.6.1 hereto with any shareholder who wishes to avail himself of the registration rights contained therein subject to the obligations and conditions contained therein and the condition set forth in section 5.15 hereof. 2.6.2 before the closing, the company shall obtain the consent of richard eisner & company to the incorporation of the financial statements prepared by richard eisner & company in purchaser's public filings as may be required after closing. 2.7 conduct of the business of the company prior to closing. 2.7.1 except (i) with the prior consent in writing of purchaser, (ii) as may be required to
