(b) each of the reporting persons believes that it has sole voting and dispositive power over the shares held by it, but acknowledges that, because it is a member of a "group" as such term is used in rule 13d-5, it may be deemed to have shared voting and dispositive power over the shares held by the other reporting persons. furthermore, upon acquisition of any warrant shares, each reporting person anticipates that it would have sole voting and dispositive power over all of the warrant shares acquired as a result thereof, but acknowledges that, because it is a member of a "group" as such term is used in rule 13d-5, it may be deemed to have shared voting and dispositive power over the warrant shares held by the other reporting persons. however, pursuant to rule 13d-4, each reporting person disclaims beneficial ownership of those shares or warrant shares over which it does not have sole voting and dispositive power. the table below summarizes the number of shares, december warrant shares and february warrant shares over which each reporting person holds sole voting and dispositive power and shared voting and dispositive power: common stock december warrant shares february warrant shares ---------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------------- sole voting/ shared voting/ sole voting/ shared voting/ sole voting/ shared voting/ dispositive dispositive dispositive dispositive dispositive dispositive ------------ -------------- ------------ -------------- ------------ -------------- infinity 644,286 165,714 155,884 43,044 12,000 10,000 seacrest 100,000 710,000 29,250 169,678 0 22,000 fairway 65,714 744,286 13,794 185,134 4,000 18,000 emerging opp. 0 810,000 0 198,928 4,000 18,000 global growth 0 810,000 0 198,928 2,000 20,000 in addition to the shares and december warrant shares described above, each of infinity, seacrest and fairway may be issued an indeterminable number of 12 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the respective purchase agreements (collectively, the "bonus shares"). the exact number of bonus shares potentially acquirable by each such reporting person is determined by reference to the formula contained in the applicable purchase agreement and, in each case, is effected by the market price of the issuer's common stock as of specified dates. as a result, the number of shares reported as beneficially owned by the reporting persons herein excludes any bonus shares. in addition to the february warrant shares described above, each of infinity, fairway, emerging opportunities and global growth may be issued an indeterminable number of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the respective bridge loan agreements (collectively, the "additional bridge warrants"). the exact number of additional bridge warrants potentially acquirable by each such reporting person is determined by reference to the formula contained in the applicable bridge loan agreements and, in each case, is affected by the market price of the issuer's common stock as of specified dates and the issuer's ability to repay the $12.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8%/10% subordinated convertible debentures (the "bridge notes") issued in connection with bridge loan agreements. a form of bridge note has been attached as exhibit 99.9 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. (c) effective november 14, 1996, infinity entered into a private securities subscription agreement with the issuer (the "original infinity subscription agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, infinity acquired 3,000 shares of series g convertible preferred stock (the "series g preferred stock") of the issuer and a common stock purchase warrant (the "original infinity warrant") entitling infinity to purchase 42,627 shares of common stock. the purchase price paid by infinity for the series g preferred stock was $1,000 per share or $3.0 million. the original infinity warrant was exercisable upon issuance and for a period of three years thereafter for $19.00 per share. additionally, effective november 14, 1996, fairway entered into a separate private securities subscription agreement with the issuer (the "original fairway subscription agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, fairway acquired 500 shares of series g preferred stock and a common stock purchase warrant (the "original fairway warrant") entitling fairway to purchase 7,104 shares of common stock. the purchase price paid by fairway for the series g preferred stock was $1,000 per share or an aggregate of $500,000. the original fairway warrant was exercisable upon issuance and for a period of three years thereafter for $19.00 per share. effective december 3, 1996, infinity entered into a second private securities subscription agreement with the issuer (the "second infinity subscription agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, infinity acquired 2,500 shares of series g preferred stock and a common stock purchase warrant (the "second infinity warrant") entitling infinity to purchase 35,523 shares of common stock. the purchase price paid by infinity for the series g preferred stock acquired in this transaction was $1,000 per share or an aggregate of $2.5 13 million. the second infinity warrant was exercisable upon issuance and for a period of three years thereafter for $19.00 per share. additionally, effective december 3, 1996, seacrest entered into a separate private securities subscription agreement with the issuer (the "original seacrest subscription agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, seacrest acquired 1,000 shares of series g preferred stock and a common stock purchase warrant (the "original seacrest warrant") entitling seacrest to purchase 14,209 shares of common stock. the purchase price paid by seacrest for the series g preferred stock acquired was $1,000 per share or an aggregate of $1.0 million. the original seacrest warrant was exercisable upon issuance and for a period of three years thereafter for $19.00 per share. subsequent to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the original infinity subscription agreement, original fairway subscription agreement, second infinity subscription agreement and original seacrest subscription agreement, the issuer requested certain modifications thereto. as a result, effective december 26, 1996, the parties elected to rescind such transactions in their entirety and consummate the transactions which are the subject of this statement. accordingly, the shares of series g preferred, original infinity warrant, original fairway warrant, second infinity warrant and original seacrest warrant issued in connection with the november and december transactions were canceled and retired by the issuer. on february 27, 1997 the issuer and infinity, fairway, emerging opportunities, global growth and certain other institutional investors completed the private placement (the "bridge loan") of an aggregate principal amount of $12,500,000 of bridge notes. infinity, fairway, emerging opportunities and global growth funded $3.0 million, $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $500,000 of the bridge loan, respectively. the bridge notes are one-year subordinated notes of the issuer and bear interest at an annual rate of eight percent (8%) per annum until august 26, 1997 and ten percent (10%) per annum thereafter. the bridge notes are convertible at the option of the holder thereof at any time after august 27, 1997 at a conversion price equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the five-day average closing bid price on the day preceding the date of conversion provided that no more than 2.5 million shares of common stock may be issued by the issuer upon the conversion of the bridge notes. the bridge notes are redeemable by the issuer at any time at the prices set forth therein. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. 14 6. contracts, arrangements, or understandings with respect to securities of the issuer. pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase agreements, infinity (relating to the shares acquired in the first tranche only) and fairway have agreed to refrain from selling the shares acquired by them until the earlier of (1) five months following the date on which an s-1 registration statement filed by the issuer registering the common stock for resale in an underwritten public offering (the "secondary offering") has been declared effective by the securities and exchange commission (the "effective date") or (2) august 1, 1997; provided, however, that if the effective date has not occurred by march 31, 1997, then the shares will be tradeable on or after april 1, 1997 without restriction pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed by the issuer which does not call for an underwritten offering. infinity (relating to the shares acquired in the second tranche) and seacrest have agreed to a similar lock-up; however, pursuant to the terms of the applicable purchase agreements, the restriction continues only until consummation of the secondary offering. notwithstanding the foregoing, the issuer has indicated to one or more of the reporting persons that it will not effect the secondary offering by march 31, 1997. in connection with the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreements, infinity, seacrest, fairway and the issuer entered into separate registration rights agreements, dated december 26, 1996 (the "registration rights agreements"), pursuant to the terms of which the issuer will file with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement covering the shares, the december warrant shares and the bonus shares, if any, for the benefit of the holders thereof. additionally, the issuer has agreed to keep such registration statement effective for a period of two years. on february 27, 1997, the issuer, infinity and fairway entered into a letter agreement providing that, among other things, the issuer would agree to repurchase, at the option of infinity and fairway, up to an aggregate amount of

provided, however, that an indemnified person or indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the indemnified person or indemnified party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified person or indemnified party and other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the company shall pay for only one separate legal counsel for the investors; such legal counsel shall be selected by the investors holding a majority in interest of the registrable securities. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified person or indemnified party under this section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party 27 comforce corporation/[buyer] december 26, 1996 registration rights agreement page 13 is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. the indemnification required by this section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as such expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred and is due and payable. 7. contribution. to the extent any indemnification provided for herein is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law;

(i) the debentures will bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum during the 180 day period following the closing, and thereafter, ten percent (10%) per annum continuing until the debentures have been fully redeemed or converted. interest on the debentures shall be payable quarterly in arrears, on the outstanding principal amount thereof, in cash or in shares of seller's common stock, at seller's option. if seller elects to pay the interest in common stock, the valuation of such common stock will be based upon the average closing bid price of seller's common stock, as reported by bloomberg, l.p., over the five-trading day period ending on the day preceding the date interest becomes due. upon redemption or conversion of the debentures, all accrued but unpaid interest will be added to the principal amount of debentures redeemed by seller or converted by buyer; (ii) any debentures left outstanding on the 360th day following closing will be automatically converted into common shares or, at the option of seller, cash equal to 125% of the principal amount of the outstanding debentures; (iii) any debentures redeemed by seller shall be redeemed in cash at a premium to the principal amount thereof, which premium shall increase in time according to the date of such redemption by seller as set forth in the form of debenture annexed hereto as exhibit a; (iv) the debentures may be converted in whole or in part, at the option of buyer, beginning 181 days following closing. seller shall have the option, subject to the terms of section 4(v) following, to make the requested conversion in either cash or common shares. any such conversion paid in cash shall be payable at 125% of the principal amount of the portion of the debenture to be converted, including any accrued but unpaid interest thereon. if seller elects to convert the debenture into common shares, the number of common shares issuable upon conversion shall be determined by dividing the principal amount of debentures to be converted plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, minus any required withholding, by 75% of the average closing bid price of seller's common stock over the five (5) trading day period ending on the day prior to conversion; 7 mr. john macgregor: february 25, 1997 comforce corporation/global growth limited page 7 (v) seller may issue no more than two million five hundred thousand (2,500,000) common shares upon conversion of the debentures and the exercise of the warrants. in the event the aforesaid limit is reached before buyer has converted all of its debentures, seller shall honor any subsequent conversion requests in cash equal to 125% of the principal amount of debentures converted. notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2.5 million share limit may be increased to 3.5 million shares if either: (i) seller's shareholders approve the increase; (ii) the american stock exchange ("amex") waives its requirement that said increase be approved by seller's shareholders, or advises seller that shareholder approval is not required; or (iii) seller changes the listing of its common stock from amex to either the new york stock exchange ("nyse") or the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system ("nasdaq") under circumstances in which shareholder approval is not required. (vi) the debentures will be subordinate to the terms and conditions of revolving credit or other bank financing in favor of seller. seller covenants and agrees that the total credit to be extended by lenders senior to the purchasers of the debentures offered hereby shall not exceed $12.5 million, and that seller will take reasonable steps to avoid defaulting on any senior debt during the term of the debentures, including all reasonable steps to cause the senior lender or lenders to waive compliance by seller with any financial covenants which may appear in any senior credit agreement, and which seller believes, in good faith, must be waived to avoid a default by seller. buyer covenants and agrees that it will execute a subordination agreement in a form no less favorable to those senior lenders than that attached hereto as exhibit c. 5. warrants. (i) under the circumstances set forth in this section 5, seller shall issue three-year warrants, prorated according to the principal amount of debentures issued to each investor in connection with this placement, as follows: (a) the investors will receive warrants to purchase one hundred thousand (100,000) shares of seller's common stock at closing; (b) if all debentures are not redeemed by seller within sixty (60) days of closing, the investors will receive warrants to purchase an additional one hundred thousand (100,000) shares of seller's common stock on the sixty-first (61st) day following closing; (c) if all debentures are not redeemed by seller within ninety (90) days of closing, the investors will receive warrants to purchase an additional one hundred thousand (100,000)shares of seller's common stock on the ninety-first (91st) day following closing; (d) if all debentures are not redeemed by seller within one hundred twenty (120) days of closing, the investors will receive warrants to purchase an additional one hundred thousand (100,000) shares of seller's common stock on the one hundred twenty-first (121st) day following closing; and (e) if all 8 mr. john macgregor: february 25, 1997 comforce corporation/global growth limited page 8 debentures are not redeemed by seller within one hundred fifty (150) days of closing, the investors will receive warrants to purchase an additional one hundred thousand (100,000) shares of seller's common stock on the one hundred fifty-first (151st) day following closing provided, however, that the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants as set forth above shall be proportionally reduced in the event that either (i) less than $25,000,000 u.s. principal amount of debentures are placed, or (ii) seller redeems less than all outstanding debentures from time to time. the warrants will have a strike price equal to the market price (defined as the average closing bid price of seller's common stock, as reported by bloomberg, l.p., over the five-day trading period ending on the day prior to the date in question) at closing and will become exercisable on the six-month anniversary of closing. (ii) in addition, if seller has not redeemed all debentures within one hundred eighty (180) days of closing, the investors shall receive additional three-year warrants (the "additional warrants") to purchase five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of seller's common stock on the one hundred eighty-first (181st) day following closing, prorated according to the principal amount of debentures issued to each investor in connection with this placement; provided, however, that the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of the additional warrants shall be proportionally reduced in the event that either (i) less than $25,000,000 u.s. principal amount of debentures are placed, or (ii) seller redeems less than all outstanding debentures from time to time. the additional warrants will have a strike price equal to the market price on the 180th day following closing and will be exercisable on the later of the issuance of the additional warrants or the effective date of the registration statement referred to below. (iii) in order to include the common shares underlying the warrants and additional warrants in seller's resale registration statement and notwithstanding the provisions of sections 5(i) and 5(ii) above, seller may, at closing, issue warrants (the "original warrants") to purchase the maximum number of common shares that each investor could potentially become entitled to receive upon exercise of any warrant or additional warrant, which original warrants shall provide for exercise upon satisfaction of the conditions to issuance as described in sections 5(i) and 5(ii) above (the "conditions"). seller shall retain the original warrants in its possession until such time as any of the applicable conditions are satisfied, whereupon seller shall issue and deliver within two (2) business days a replacement warrant or additional warrant, as the case may be, to each investor with respect to the common shares for which the conditions are satisfied. the warrants and additional warrants so issued shall be exercisable as to the 9 mr. john macgregor: february 25, 1997 comforce corporation/global growth limited page 9 number of common shares and at the price stated thereon, as determined pursuant to the terms of the original warrants and this agreement. 6. conversion of debentures, exercise of warrants, and issuance of common shares. (i) on or after the 181st day following closing, buyer may convert any outstanding debentures into common shares or cash, at the option of the seller, in accordance with the terms set forth herein and the form of debenture annexed hereto as exhibit a; (ii) all of the warrants shall be exercisable into common shares, on or after the 181st day following the closing, in accordance with the terms of the common stock purchase warrant certificate annexed hereto as exhibit b; provided however, that the additional warrants, if any, shall be exercisable upon the later of the issuance of the additional warrants or the effective date of the registration statement referred to below; (iii) upon conversion of the debentures and exercise of the warrants and additional warrants following effectiveness of a registration statement pursuant to section 7 hereof, seller shall use its best efforts to issue and deliver to buyer an unlegended certificate or certificates for the number of common shares to which buyer shall be entitled within five (5) business days after buyer has fulfilled all conditions required for conversion as set forth in this agreement and annexed forms of debenture and common stock purchase warrant certificate made part of this agreement (the "deadline"). seller understands that a delay in the issuance of the common shares beyond the deadline could result in economic loss to buyer. as compensation to buyer for such loss, and not as a penalty, seller agrees to pay liquidated damages to buyer for late issuance of common shares upon conversion of the debentures in the amount of one percent (1%) of the requested conversion amount per day, beginning on the seventh (7th) business day from the date of receipt by seller of a duly executed notice of conversion of the debentures, provided that the original debentures to be converted have been delivered to seller within such time period, all in accordance with this agreement and the forms of debenture annexed hereto, and the requirements of seller's transfer agent. said liquidated damages shall accrue each day through the date the common shares are issued to buyer, and shall be paid by wire transfer to an account designated by buyer upon the earlier to occur of (i) issuance of said common shares to buyer, or (ii) each monthly anniversary of the receipt by seller of such buyer's notice of conversion. nothing herein shall waive seller's obligations to deliver common shares upon conversion of the debentures or exercise of the warrants or limit buyer's right to pursue actual damages for seller's failure to issue and deliver common shares to buyer in accordance with the terms of this agreement. 10 mr. john macgregor: february 25, 1997 comforce corporation/global growth limited page 10 (iv) seller agrees that, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to buyer, in the event seller fails for any reason to effect delivery to buyer of certificates representing common shares within seven (7) business days following receipt by seller of a notice of conversion with respect to the debentures or an election to purchase with respect to the warrants and additional warrants, buyer may revoke such notice of conversion or election to purchase by delivering a notice of such effect to seller, whereupon seller and buyer shall each be restored to their respective positions immediately prior to delivery of such notice of conversion or election to purchase. 7. registration. subject to the terms of the registration rights agreement annexed hereto, seller must register the common shares underlying the debentures, warrants and the additional warrants for resale with the u.s. securities and exchange commission ("sec"), and the registration statement therefor (the "registration statement") must be declared effective by the sec on or before the day prior to the six-month anniversary of closing (the "required effective date"). in the event the registration statement has not been declared effective by the required effective date (such situation referred to herein as "late registration"), seller shall pay to buyer cash equal to 1% of the aggregate subscription price for the first month and 2% of the aggregate subscription price per month thereafter (the "penalties") until the registration statement is declared effective, and as further provided in the registration rights agreement annexed hereto. provided that seller has reasonably used its best efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the sec prior to the required effective date, buyer shall have no other remedy for damages resulting solely from late registration for the period between closing and the nine-month anniversary of closing. thereafter, buyer shall be free to bring any action allowable in law or in equity against seller as a result of late registration, and the penalties shall continue to apply until the registration statement has been declared effective by the sec and seller has notified buyer of that fact. these time periods, the penalties, and other obligations under the registration rights agreement annexed hereto may be extended or suspended under terms and conditions mutually agreed to in writing by seller and buyer. 8. third party beneficiary. the parties acknowledge and agree that shoreline pacific, the institutional division of financial west group ("shoreline pacific"), shall be deemed a third party beneficiary of seller's agreements and representations set forth in this agreement, entitled to enforce the terms thereof, and to indemnification for any damages resulting to shoreline pacific from any actual or threatened breach thereof by seller, 11 mr. john macgregor: february 25, 1997 comforce corporation/global growth limited page 11 both in shoreline pacific's personal capacity and, should shoreline pacific so elect, on behalf of buyer. 9. closing. debentures shall be delivered to buyer and the funds therefor shall be delivered to seller on or before february 27, 1997(the "closing") or at such time to be mutually agreed. 10. conditions to closing (i) buyer understands that seller's obligation to sell the debentures is conditioned upon delivery into escrow or otherwise as agreed between buyer and seller by buyer of the amount set forth in section 1 hereof.

(iii) seller understands that buyer's obligation to purchase the debentures is conditioned upon seller and buyer entering into a registration rights agreement substantially in the form of annex i hereto. (iv) seller understands that buyer's obligation to purchase the debentures is contingent upon seller having consummated the sale of a total placement of at least $13 million in the aggregate of debentures at closing, inclusive of the debentures being purchased by buyer, each pursuant to the terms of this agreement and the other agreements referred to herein, and similar such agreements with the other buyers of the debentures.

warrant and the warrant shares received upon exercise of this warrant shall be subject to restrictions on transferability until registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and applicable

evidenced by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 (the "act") and may not be offered or sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except

the company will, within 5 business days of the holder's request, exchange the legended certificates, without charge, for unlegended, but otherwise identical, certificates. if any warrant shares are issued after the registration statement registering them for resale becomes effective, then said warrant shares shall not bear any restrictive legend. 5 6 8.2 procedure for transfer. any transfer permitted hereunder shall be made by surrender of this warrant to the company at its principal office or to any person designated by the company as the transfer agent for this warrant (the "transfer agent") at its offices with a duly executed request to transfer the warrant, which shall provide adequate information and evidence of authority (in the case of execution by a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity that is not a natural person) to effect such transfer and shall be accompanied by funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes applicable to the transfer. in the case of a partial transfer of this warrant, upon compliance with the immediately preceding sentence, this warrant shall be divided into two or more warrants of even date herewith setting forth warrant amounts that in the aggregate are equal to the warrant amount immediately prior to the transfer. upon satisfaction of all transfer conditions, the company or transfer agent shall, without charge, execute and deliver a new warrant in the name of the transferee named in such transfer request dated as of the date of this warrant, and this warrant promptly shall be canceled. 8.3 transfer only pursuant to an effective

shares deliverable upon exercise of this warrant and other rights of the holder are set forth in the registration rights agreement dated as of february 26, 1997 between the holder and the company. 10. adjustment of number of warrant shares issuable and exercise price. the number of warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant (the "warrant number"), and the exercise price therefor, are subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in, or as otherwise provided in, this section 10. 6 7 10.1 adjustment for change in capital stock. if the company: (1) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its common stock; (2) subdivides or reclassifies its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares; (3) combines or reclassifies its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares; (4) makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its capital stock other than common stock; or (5) issues by reclassification of its common stock any shares of its capital stock; then the warrant number in effect immediately prior to such action shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder may receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the company which he or it would have owned immediately following such action if such warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such action. in addition, the exercise price on the effective date of such distribution or reclassification or the effective date of such action shall be adjusted by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event. the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. if the occurrence of any event listed above results in an adjustment under section 10.2 or 10.3 below, no further adjustment shall be made under this section 10.1. 10.2 adjustment for rights issue. if the company distributes any rights, options or warrants (whether or not immediately exercisable) to all holders of its common stock entitling them to purchase shares of common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, at a price per share less than the current market value (as hereinafter defined) per share on the record date relating to such distribution, the warrant number shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: 1 w = w x (o + n) ------- o + (n x p) ------- m where: 1 w = the adjusted warrant number. 7 8 w = the warrant number immediately prior to the record date for any such distribution. o = the number of fully diluted shares (as hereinafter defined) outstanding on the record date for any such distribution without accounting for such rights, options or warrants. n = the number of additional shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants. p = the exercise price per share of such rights, options or warrants. m = the current market value per share of common stock on the record date for any such distribution. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the rights, options or warrants. if at the end of the period during which such rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, the warrant shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been if "n" in the above formula had been the number of shares actually issued. in addition, the exercise price on the effective date of such distribution or reclassification or the effective date of such action shall be adjusted by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event. 10.3 adjustment for other distributions. if the company distributes to all holders of its common stock (i) any evidence of indebtedness of the company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries (other than cash dividends which are paid out of retained earnings of the company or the company and are not prohibited by the indenture), or (iii) any rights, options or warrants to acquire any of the foregoing or to acquire any other securities of the company, the warrant number shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: 1 w = w x m ----- m - f where: 1 w = the adjusted warrant number. w = the current warrant number on the record date mentioned below. 8 9 m = the current market value per share of common stock on the record date mentioned below. f = the fair market value on the record date mentioned below of the indebtedness, assets, rights, options or warrants distributable to one share of common stock. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution. if an adjustment is made pursuant to clause (iii) above of this section 10.3 as a result of the issuance of rights, options or warrants and at the end of the period during which any such rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all such rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, the warrant shall be immediately readjusted as if "f" in the above formula was the fair market value on the record date of the indebtedness or assets actually distributed upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. in addition, the exercise price on the effective date of such distribution or reclassification or the effective date of such action shall be adjusted by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event. this section 10.3 does not apply to rights, options or warrants referred to in section 10.2. 10.4 certain definitions for purposes of this section 10. (a) the "current market value" per share of common stock or of any other security (herein collectively referred to as a "security") at any date shall be: (1) if the security is not registered under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), (i) the value of the security determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company and certified in a board resolution, based on the most recently completed arm's length transaction between the company and a person other than an affiliate of the company, the closing of which occurs on such date or shall have occurred within the six months proceeding such date, (ii) if no such transaction shall have occurred on such date or within such six-month period, the value of the security most recently determined as of a date within the six months preceding such date by an independent financial expert (as defined below) or (iii) if neither clause (i) nor (ii) is applicable, the value of the security determined as of such date by an independent financial expert; or (2) if the security is registered under the exchange act, the average of the daily market prices for each business day during the period commencing 30 business days before such date and ending on the date one day prior to such 9 10 date or, if the security has been registered under the exchange act for less than 30 consecutive business days before such date, then the average of the daily market prices for all of the business days before such date for which daily market prices are available. if the market price is not determinable for at least 15 business days in such period, the current market value of the security shall be determined as if the security was not registered under the exchange act. (b) the "market price" for any security on each business day means: (a) if such security is listed or admitted to trading on any securities exchange, the closing price, regular way, on such day on the principal exchange on which such security is traded, or if no sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such day, (b) if such security is not then listed or admitted to trading on any securities exchange, the last reported sale price on such day, or if there is no such last reported sale price on such day, the average of the closing bid and the asked prices on such day, as reported by a reputable quotation source designated by the company, or (c) if neither clause (a) nor (b) is applicable, the average of the reported high bid and low asked prices on such day, as reported by a reputable quotation source, or a newspaper of general circulation in the borough of manhattan, city of new york, customarily published on each business day, designated by the company. if there are no such prices on a business day, then the market price shall not be determinable for such business day. (c) "independent financial expert" shall mean a nationally recognized investment banking firm reasonably acceptable to the holders of a majority of the warrants having the same terms as this warrant (the "warrants") (i) that does not (and whose directors, officers, employees and affiliates do not) have a direct or indirect material financial interest in the company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) that has not been, and at the time it is called upon to serve as an independent financial expert under this agreement is not (and none of whose directors, officers, employees or affiliates is) an employee, director or officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) that has not been retained by the company or any of its subsidiaries for any purpose, other than to perform an equity valuation, within the preceding twelve months, and (iv) that, in the reasonable judgment of the board of directors of the company, is otherwise qualified to serve as an independent financial advisor. any such person may receive customary compensation and indemnification by the company for opinions or services it provides as an independent financial expert. (d) "affiliate" shall mean, with respect to any person, any other person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such person. for the purposes of this definition, "control," when used with respect to any person, means the power to direct the management and policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings correlative to the foregoing. (e) for purposes of this section 10 the term "shares of common stock" shall mean (i) shares of the class of stock designated as the common stock of the company at the date of this agreement, and (ii) shares of any other class of stock resulting from successive 10 11 changes or reclassification of such shares consisting solely of changes in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value. (f) "fully diluted shares" shall mean (i) the shares of common stock outstanding as of a specified date, and (ii) shares of common stock into or for which rights, options, warrants or other securities outstanding as of such date are exercisable or convertible (other than the warrants). 10.5 when de minimis adjustment may be deferred. no adjustment in the warrant number need be made immediately unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 0.5% in the warrant number. notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, provided that no such adjustment shall be deferred beyond the date on which a warrant is exercised. all calculations under this section 10 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. 10.6 when no adjustment required. if an adjustment is made upon the establishment of a record date for a distribution subject to sections 10.1, 10.2 or 10.3 hereof and such distribution is subsequently canceled, the warrant number then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the board of directors determines to cancel such distribution, to that which would have been in effect if such record date had not been fixed. 10.7 notice of adjustment. whenever the warrant number is adjusted, the company shall provide notice thereof to the holder. 10.8 when issuance or payment may be deferred. in any case in which this section 10 shall require that an adjustment in the warrant number be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the company may elect to defer the adjustment until the occurrence of such event (i) directing the transfer agent to issue to the holder after such record date the warrant shares and other capital stock of the company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the warrant shares and other capital stock of the company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the warrant number prior to such adjustment, and (ii) directing the transfer agent to pay to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share pursuant to section 10;

(d) less than all of the principal amount of this debenture may be converted if the portion converted is $10,000 or a whole multiple of $10,000 and the provisions of this article 3 that apply to the conversion of all of the debenture also apply to the conversion of a portion of it. all accrued interest on this debenture shall be added to the amount converted and shall be deemed to be paid and

common stock as determined by the board of directors of the company in its good faith judgment. section 3.8. mergers, etc. if the company merges or consolidates with another corporation or sells or
