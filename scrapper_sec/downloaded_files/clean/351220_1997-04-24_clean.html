employee by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or otherwise. upon the death of employee, employee's estate shall have 180 days from the date of employee's death to exercise the option. if

the date thereof to and including the date of such exercise, obtained such shares and all other or additional (or less) stock and other securities and property (including cash in the case referred to in clause (ii) above) receivable by him as aforesaid during such period, giving effect to all adjustments called for during such period by the following subparagraph. (b) in case of any reorganization of the corporation (or any other corporation the stock or other securities of which are at the time receivable on the exercise of this option) after the date hereof, or in case, after such date, the corporation (or any such other corporation) shall consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or enter into a mandatory share exchange with another entity, then and in each such case the holder of this option, upon the exercise hereof as provided herein at any time after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, merger, mandatory share exchange, or conveyance, shall be entitled to receive, and any third parties participating in such transaction shall acknowledge in writing that the holder is entitled to receive, in lieu of the shares, stock or other securities and property receivable upon the exercise of this option prior to such consummation, the stock or other securities or property to which such holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such holder had exercised this option immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment as provided in the preceding subparagraph (a).

employer, special training and knowledge specific to employer's business. employee acknowledges that included in the special knowledge received is confidential and proprietary information including the confidential information defined in paragraph 9 below which employer invested extensive time and resources in developing and creating . employee acknowledges that this confidential information is valuable to employer, and therefore, its protection and maintenance constitutes a legitimate interest to be protected by employer by the enforcement of this covenant not to compete. therefore, as an inducement to employer to enter into this agreement, to invest time in training and educating employee and to disclose to employee confidential and proprietary information, employee agrees that prior to a termination of this agreement and for a period of thirty- six months following the effective date of a termination of this agreement (specifically excluding a termination of this agreement by employer without cause pursuant to paragraph 7.a. hereof and specifically excluding a termination of this agreement by employee following a change in control, as defined in paragraph 7.f. hereof), employee will not, directly as a principal (whether individually or in any form of entity) or as an employee or consultant, engage in, consult with or participate in or with, any business reasonably competitive with and within a five mile radius of any hotel or restaurant owned, operated, managed or under construction by employer, or any "affiliate", as hereinafter defined, of employer, during the employment agreement term or at the time this agreement is terminated. for purposes of this agreement, "affiliates" means any person or entity that is directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, employer. employee represents to employer that the enforcement of the restriction contained in this paragraph 8.a. would not be unduly burdensome to employee and that in order to induce employer to pay employee's compensation during the employment agreement term, to train employee and to divulge confidential information to employee, employee further represents and acknowledges that employee is willing and able to compete in other geographical areas not prohibited by this section 8.a. b. employee agrees that a breach or violation by employee of the covenants contained in this paragraph 8 shall entitle employer, as a matter of right, to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any further or continued breach or violation of this covenant. such right to an injunction shall be cumulative and in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies to which the employer may show itself justly entitled including without limitation employee's forfeiture of any sums then owed to employee pursuant to paragraph 7 hereof and/or the obligation by employee to repay employer for any sums previously paid to employee pursuant to paragraph 7 hereof. c. the representations and covenants contained in this paragraph 8 on the part of employee will be construed as ancillary to and independent of any other provision of this agreement and the existence of any claim or cause of action of employee against employer or any officer or director of employer, whether predicated on a disagreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by employer of the covenants of employee contained in this paragraph 8. d. the parties to this agreement agree that the limitations contained in this paragraph 8 with respect to geographic area, duration and scope of activity are reasonable. however, if any court shall determine that the geographic area, duration or scope of activity of any restriction contained in this paragraph 8 is unenforceable, it is the intention of the parties that such restrictive covenant set forth herein shall not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed amended to the extent required to render it valid and enforceable. 9. disclosure of confidential information. -------------------------------------- a. employee will disclose to the employer all ideas and business plans developed by employee through the effective date of a termination of this agreement that relate directly to the business of the employer. b. the employee

sums previously paid to employee pursuant to paragraph 7 hereof. c. the representations and covenants contained in this paragraph 8 on the part of employee will be construed as ancillary to and independent of any other provision of this agreement and the existence of any claim or cause of action of employee against employer or any officer or director of employer, whether predicated on a disagreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by employer of the covenants of employee contained in this paragraph 8. d. the parties to this agreement agree that the limitations contained in this paragraph 8 with respect to geographic area, duration and scope of activity are reasonable. however, if any court shall determine that the geographic area, duration or

select the arbitrator from one of the five. the decision of aaa with respect to the selection of the arbitrator will be final and binding. within 10 days after the selection of the arbitrator, the parties and their council will appear before the arbitrator at a price an time designated by the arbitrator for the purpose of each party making a one hour or less presentation and summary of the case. thereafter, the arbitrator will set dates and times for additional hearings until the proceeding is concluded. the desire and goal of the parties is, and the arbitrator will be advised that his
