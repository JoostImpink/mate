(2) whenever the exercise price payable upon exercise of each warrant is adjusted pursuant to subsection (1) above, the number of shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant shall simultaneously be adjusted by multiplying the number of shares initially issuable upon exercise of this warrant by the exercise price in effect on the date hereof and dividing the product so obtained by the exercise price, as adjusted. 5 71 (3) in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to subsection (1) above, the holder of this warrant thereafter shall become entitled to receive any shares of the company, other than common stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of this warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the common stock contained in subsection (1) above. (i) registration under the securities act of 1933. (1) the company shall advise the holder of this warrant or of the warrant shares or any then holder of warrants or warrant shares (such persons being collectively referred to herein as "holders") by written notice at least two weeks prior to the filing of any registration statement or post-effective amendment thereto under the securities act of 1933 covering securities of the company and will for the period until october 23, 2001, upon the request of any such holder, include in any such registration statement such information as may be required to permit a public offering of the warrant shares. in connection with its filing of any registration statement or post-effective amendment thereto, the company shall supply prospectuses and other documents as the holder may request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the warrant shares, qualify the warrant shares for sale in such states as any such holder designates and do any and all other acts and things which may be necessary or desirable to enable such holders to consummate the public sale or other disposition of the warrant shares. (2) if any registration pursuant to subsection 1 of this section (i) shall be underwritten in whole or in part, the company may require that the warrant shares requested for inclusion pursuant to subsection 1 of this section (i) be included in the underwriting on the same terms and conditions as the securities otherwise being sold through the underwriters. in the event that in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter of such public offering the inclusion of all of the warrant shares covered by a request for registration would reduce the number of shares to be offered by the company or interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of stock offered by the company, the number of warrant shares otherwise to be included in the underwritten public offering may be reduced pro rata (by number of shares) among the holders thereof requesting such registration or excluded in their entirety if so required by the underwriter. to the extent only a portion of the warrant shares is included in the underwritten public offering, those warrant 6 72 shares which are thus excluded from the underwritten public offering shall be withheld from the market by the holders thereof for a period, not to exceed 120 days, which the managing underwriter reasonably determines is necessary in order to effect the underwritten public offering. the obligation of the company under subsection 2 of this section (i) shall be limited to two registration statements. (3) the company shall bear the entire cost and expense of any registration of securities initiated by it under subsection (1) of this section (i) notwithstanding that warrant shares may be included in any such registration. any holder whose warrant shares are included in any such registration statement pursuant to this section (i) shall, however, bear the fees of his own counsel and any registration fees, transfer taxes or underwriting discounts or commissions applicable to the warrant shares sold by him pursuant thereto. xplor corporation [seal] by: ------------------------------ dated: may , 1997 name: title: attest: - - ----------------------------- name: title: 7 73 purchase form date , 19 ------------ -- the undersigned hereby irrevocably elects to exercise the within warrant to the extent of purchasing _______ shares of common stock and hereby makes payment of _______ in payment of the actual exercise price thereof. ---------------- instructions for registration of stock name -------------------------------- (please typewrite or print in block letters) address ----------------------------- signature --------------------------- 74 assignment form for value received, ______________ hereby sells, assigns and transfers unto name ----------------------------- (please typewrite or print in block letters) address ---------------------------- the right to purchase common stock represented by this warrant to the extent of ______ shares as to which such right is exercisable and does hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint ___________ as attorney, to transfer the same on the books of the company with full power of substitution in the premises. date , 19 ------------ -- signature ------------------- 75 omitted schedules and exhibits the following schedules and exhibits have not been filed herewith. the registrant hereby agrees to supplementally furnish them to the commission upon request: xplor disclosure schedule schedule a xplor reserve report schedule aa xplor other properties schedule aaa venus disclosure schedule schedule b venus reserve report schedule bb venus other properties schedule bbb lomak disclosure schedule schedule c lomak reserve report schedule cc xplor directors and officers, post closing exhibit 8.01 opinion of jones & faye, p.l.l.c. exhibit 9.02(d)(i) opinion of rubin baum levin constant & freidman exhibit 9.02(d)(ii) opinion of neville shaver hubbard & mclean exhibit 9.03(d)(i) share purchase and sale agreement exhibit 9.03(i) ex-99.(b) 3 shareholders agreement dated - 5/21/97 1 exhibit 99(b) stockholders agreement dated as of may __, 1997 by and among: (a) the persons or entities listed in exhibit 1 annexed hereto (the "ames group") acting through eugene l. ames, jr.

(c) if the non-selling stockholders do not elect to purchase the offered shares, the offered shares may be sold by the selling stockholder at any time within 30 days after the date the first offer was made, subject to the provisions of section 6 and 7. any such sale shall be to the proposed transferee, at not less than the price and upon other terms and conditions, if any, not more favorable to the proposed transferee than those specified in the first offer. any remaining shares not sold within such 30-day period shall continue to be subject to the requirements of prior offers pursuant to this section 6. if offered shares are sold pursuant to this section 6 to any person who is not a party to this agreement, the offered shares so sold shall no longer be subject to any of the restrictions imposed by this agreement. (d) notwithstanding the foregoing subsections (a) through (c) of this section 6. if a selling stockholder wishes to sell shares pursuant to rule 144 (or its successor provision), the non-selling stockholder shall have the right, exercisable within 7 business days following receipt of a form 144 notice of sale, to purchase the shares subject to such notice at the closing price of the shares on the first trade date immediately before the date of the filing of such notice. if any non-selling shareholder elects to purchase such shares the closing will be effected within 3 business days following its election to purchase. if the non-selling shareholder elect not to purchase, the selling shareholder shall be free to sell the shares covered by the notice for a period of 30 days thereafter. 7. right of participation in sales by ames group or lomak group.

(b) the other party shall notify the participation seller in writing of such intention as soon as practicable and in any event within ten business days after the date the first offer was made. such notification shall be given to such participation seller in accordance with section 10 below. (c) the participation seller and the other party shall sell to the buyer all, or at the option of the buyer, any part of the shares proposed to be sold by them at not less than the price and upon other terms and conditions, if any, not more favorable to the buyer than those in the first offer provided by the participation seller under section 6 above; provided, however, that any purchase of less than all of such shares by the buyer shall be made from the participation seller and the other party, pro rata, based upon the relative amount of the shares that the participation seller and the other party is otherwise entitled to sell pursuant to section 7(a).
