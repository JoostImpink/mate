to russian law (the &#147;squeeze-out&#148;). following completion of these compulsory purchases, the parties will cause all but one share of ojsc vimpelcom&#146;s common stock acquired by vimpelcom ltd. to be transferred to vimpelcom holdings. the parties agreed to cause vimpelcom ltd. to pay all transaction-related costs, fees and expenses incurred in respect of the foregoing transactions. the parties also agreed to cause vimpelcom ltd. to use its best efforts to obtain adequate financing to pay all costs, fees and expenses for completion of the squeeze-out, including paying any cash consideration to ojsc vimpelcom&#146;s shareholders. if vimpelcom ltd. is unable to procure or raise adequate financing to pay such costs, fees or expenses, the parties agreed to lend the necessary funds to vimpelcom ltd. on commercially reasonable terms. indemnification the alfa parties, on the one hand, and the telenor parties, on the other hand, each agreed to indemnify and hold the telenor parties and the alfa parties, respectively, harmless from and against all losses incurred or sustained which result from (a) any breach of any representation and warranty given or made by the indemnifying party (excluding representations and warranties made regarding storm llc), or (b) the noncompliance with or nonperformance of any obligation or covenant under the share exchange agreement (excluding obligations in respect of storm llc). a party will have no obligation to make any payment in respect of a claim arising by reason of a contingent liability until such liability ceases to be contingent and becomes actual, and will have no liability in respect of any claim: &#149; arising as a direct result of an increase in rates of any tax implemented on or after the closing date or the passing of any legislation after the closing date with retroactive effect; or &#149; for punitive damages, except to the extent such punitive damages are payable to a third person, or to the extent an affiliate had failed to mitigate the loss. in addition, for a five year period following the closing date, altimo agreed to indemnify and hold each of vimpelcom ltd., vimpelcom holdings, storm and kyivstar (collectively, the &#147;storm indemnified parties&#148;) harmless from and against all losses actually incurred or sustained (a) which arise out of or result from vimpelcom holdings&#146; acquisition of the ownership interests in storm and vimpelcom holdings&#146; ownership interests in kyivstar through storm and (b) which would not have arisen out of or resulted from vimpelcom holdings&#146; direct acquisition of the alfa parties&#146; ownership interests in kyivstar. indemnifiable losses include losses which arise out of any breach of representations and warranties made regarding storm or the noncompliance with or nonperformance of any obligations of the alfa parties in respect of storm or any related tax issues. during the five year period immediately following completion of the kyivstar share exchange, altimo may present a proposal to vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s board of directors for restructuring vimpelcom holdings&#146; ownership of kyivstar through storm and the ownership interests in storm through a merger, liquidation or other corporate restructuring that will mitigate any taxes that are or may become due or payable and that may result in an indemnification claim against altimo. any such restructuring proposal must be accompanied by written tax advice describing the tax and accounting implications of undertaking the restructuring proposal and concluding that such proposal will reduce or eliminate the taxes that could result in the indemnification claim, as well as a legal opinion describing the corporate and other legal implications of undertaking the transactions described in the proposal and confirming that such transactions will not violate applicable law. through a power of attorney that will entitle telenor mobile to enforce the rights of each storm indemnified party without the need for any further corporate action, telenor mobile will be entitled to cause vimpelcom ltd. to exercise each storm indemnified party&#146;s indemnification rights and either accept or reject a restructuring proposal or respond with a revised restructuring proposal. if telenor mobile causes vimpelcom ltd. to reject a restructuring proposal, then altimo will have no subsequent liability in respect of any taxes that are or will become due and payable because such restructuring proposal is not implemented. if telenor mobile causes vimpelcom ltd. to accept the restructuring proposal, altimo will be liable for the aggregate amount of all losses actually incurred or sustained by any storm indemnified party arising out of the indemnification claims and the implementation of the restructuring proposal. the share exchange agreement provides that the respective indemnification liability of the alfa parties and the telenor parties in respect of claims arising on or after the completion of the offers and the kyivstar share exchange will not exceed us$3.0 billion in the aggregate, other than altimo&#146;s liability to the storm indemnified parties, which will not exceed an additional us$1.0 billion. shareholders agreement the shareholders agreement, dated as of october 4, 2009, between the alfa parties (together with

would decrease to less than the percentage of vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s outstanding shares owned by them immediately after the closing date, then, on one occasion only during that period, the alfa shareholders and the telenor shareholders (as applicable) may acquire such number of shares as would result in their respective ownership of vimpelcom ltd. shares being equal to or less than the percentage of vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s outstanding shares owned immediately after the closing date. each shareholder also agreed not to exceed a 45% ownership interest in vimpelcom ltd. under any circumstances during such five year period. if vimpelcom ltd. approves an issuance of common shares to a shareholder (the &#147;equity-receiving party&#148;) as consideration for a related m&#038;a transaction, the other unaffiliated shareholders (the &#147;equity-purchasing party&#148;) will have the right to purchase from the equity-receiving party such number of common shares as will bring the ratio of shares owned by the equity-receiving party to shares owned by the equity-purchasing party to the same ratio that existed immediately prior to the completion of the related m&#038;a transaction. any common shares issued in connection with a related m&#038;a transaction must be structured so that the percentage ownership of vimpelcom ltd. shares of the equity-receiving party or

either the alfa shareholders or the telenor shareholders beneficially own less than 25% of vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s outstanding voting shares, then such shareholder must not, until the first anniversary of the date on which it has ceased to beneficially own at least 25%, take any action to acquire any vimpelcom ltd. shares, subject to certain exceptions, and the standstill restrictions will no longer apply to the shareholder owning greater than 25%. in addition, the shareholders agreement provides that the shareholders may, subject to certain transfer restrictions, reduce their respective

if the selling party receives any offers from the other shareholders, the selling party must, within ten days after receipt of such offers, determine whether to accept or reject any such offers. if the selling party accepts a shareholder&#146;s offer, the share purchase must be made in accordance with the terms of such offer. if the selling party rejects all such offers, then the selling party may transfer all of the shares offered by the selling party to any third-party purchaser at a price that is at least 2% higher than the maximum price stated in any shareholder&#146;s offer. if the other shareholders elect not to exercise their respective rights of first offer, the selling party may transfer all of the shares offered by the selling party to any third-party purchaser, provided such sale is completed within 120 days. tag along rights if the selling party receives a bona fide offer to transfer its shares that the selling party wishes to accept (an &#147;offer&#148;), the selling party must disclose to the other shareholders information concerning the identity of the offeror, the purchase price per share in cash and the terms and conditions of the proposed offer, and the other shareholders each will have the right to transfer all or part of their shares to the offeror pro-rata with the selling party. any other shareholder wishing to exercise its right to participate in the proposed transfer must provide the selling party with a notice, indicating the number of shares to be included in the proposed transfer and price per share that such shareholder is willing to accept for its shares. if the selling party wishes to accept the offer, the selling party must require the offeror to offer to purchase such number of shares as all other shareholders wish to transfer. if the offeror is unwilling or unable to acquire all such shares upon the terms presented, the selling party may either cancel the proposed transfer or allocate the maximum number of shares that the offeror is willing to purchase pro-rata between the selling party and all other shareholders wishing to participate in the proposed transfer. the selling party must cause the offeror to issue a notice to the other shareholders, indicating the total number of shares that the offeror is willing to purchase and the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer. the other shareholders will then have ten days to either accept the offer, in which case the proposed transfer must be completed within 120 days following such acceptance, or reject the offer, in which case the selling party may transfer to the offeror all of its shares identified in the notice to the other shareholders for a purchase price payable in cash. exceptions the transfer restrictions, right of first offer

number of their shares in vimpelcom ltd. to altimo&#146;s minority shareholders without application of the transfer restrictions provided in the shareholders agreement. governance of vimpelcom ltd. vimpelcom ltd. is governed by a supervisory board a management board. the management board consists of the ceo and other senior executives. the ceo has exclusive authority, among other things, to identify, negotiate and propose to the supervisory board m&#038;a transactions and identify and recommend to the supervisory board for the supervisory board&#146;s ratification, vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s senior executives. the supervisory board consists of nine members, three of whom are nominated by the alfa shareholders, three of whom are nominated by the telenor shareholders, and three of whom are independent and unaffiliated with either the alfa parties or the telenor parties. directors are nominated to the supervisory board as follows: at least six months prior to each annual general meeting of shareholders, the alfa shareholders and the telenor shareholders each will nominate three directors to become their nominees on the supervisory board. if so proposed by the alfa shareholders and the telenor shareholders, the supervisory board&#146;s nominating committee may recommend that any of the three then-serving unaffiliated directors serve another term as a director. if the nominating committee has not received such a proposal from at least two directors nominated by the alfa shareholders and at least two directors nominated by the telenor shareholders, the nominating committee will select an internationally recognized executive search firm to identify and propose ten candidates who meet the applicable requirements for unaffiliated directors to become the three unaffiliated director candidates. upon receiving the proposal, the nominating committee will hold a committee meeting at which at least one director nominated by the alfa shareholders and one director nominated by the telenor shareholders will be present. at such meeting, a director nominated by the telenor shareholders will eliminate a candidate from the proposed list, followed by a director nominated by the alfa shareholders eliminating a candidate from the list, and the process will continue until only four candidates remain (the director selecting first will rotate annually). the nominating committee will then select three candidates from the remaining list of four candidates to become the three unaffiliated director nominees. the committee will submit the nine candidates (three nominated by the alfa shareholders, three nominated by the telenor shareholders, and three unaffiliated) to the supervisory board, which will then submit the nominees to vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s shareholders for election to the supervisory board. the presence at any supervisory board meeting of at least six directors is necessary to constitute a quorum. the affirmative vote of any five directors is necessary to approve any matter submitted to the supervisory board, except for the issuance of new shares in an aggregate amount exceeding 10% of vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s then-currently outstanding shares, any related party agreement, the approval of the headquarters budget, the appointment and removal of the ceo of vimpelcom ltd., any amendment to the charter of any committee of the supervisory board, and the approval of certain m&#038;a transactions and any related m&#038;a transaction, each of which will require the approval of at least six directors. the approval of m&#038;a transactions in certain situations also requires the affirmative approval of vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s shareholders. in addition, the supervisory board has established and will maintain a nominating and corporate governance committee, an audit committee, a compensation committee and a financial committee. if the ceo resigns or is terminated, a new ceo will be selected as follows: a search consultant will identify and present to the compensation committee a proposal for a maximum of five candidates who meet certain requirements. if no candidate receives at least six affirmative votes after three votes of the supervisory board and consultations between the shareholders, and the then current ceo is still acting as the ceo, the supervisory board will offer the then current ceo the opportunity to serve for one more year. if there is no then current ceo, the then current ceo will not agree to serve for a further one year period or the ceo has already served for a further one year period, the telenor shareholders and the alfa shareholders must cause the directors nominated by them to vote to convene a special general meeting of vimpelcom ltd. shareholders as soon as practicable to select one of the three then current unaffiliated directors to serve as a member of the compensation committee. at such a special general meeting, the unaffiliated director receiving the highest number of affirmative votes held by shareholders other than the alfa shareholders or the telenor shareholders will be selected as the designated member of the compensation committee. following such selection, the compensation committee will meet to consider ceo candidates. the candidate receiving at least two affirmative votes of members of the compensation committee will be appointed as the ceo. after the closing date, the boards of directors of kyivstar, ojsc vimpelcom and vimpelcom holdings each will consist of five members, one of whom will be nominated by altimo, one of whom will be nominated by telenor, and three of whom will be proposed by the ceo and approved by the supervisory board. in addition, after the closing date, kyivstar and ojsc vimpelcom will amend their respective charters to remove redundant provisions requiring supermajority voting by members of their respective boards of directors for certain major decisions and simplify the governance procedures. pre-emptive rights the shareholders agreement grants pre-emptive rights to each shareholder with respect to the newly issued vimpelcom ltd. shares. if vimpelcom ltd. proposes to issue new securities, it must give each shareholder written notice, stating the price per security, the identity of the purchaser(s) and the principal terms of the issuance, and each shareholder will then have ten business days to elect to purchase up to its pro-rata number of securities for the price and upon the terms specified in the notice. debt acquisitions each shareholder and its respective affiliates are permitted to acquire debt obligations of vimpelcom ltd. or any of its affiliates so long as such shareholder provides a written notice to vimpelcom ltd. within ten days of entering into such acquisition transaction offering to sell the relevant debt obligation to vimpelcom ltd. at its fair market value. if a shareholder or any of its affiliates owns an interest in a debt obligation of vimpelcom ltd. or any of its affiliates, prior to initiating or participating in any enforcement action or bankruptcy proceeding with respect to such debt obligation, such shareholder must provide 90 days&#146; prior written notice to vimpelcom ltd. or take all actions necessary to ensure that any such action is terminated or withdrawn. other arrangements vimpelcom ltd. agreed to pay all transaction-related costs, fees and expenses incurred in respect of the offers and the squeeze-out and use its best efforts to raise sufficient funds. if vimpelcom ltd. is unable to raise sufficient funds, the alfa parties and the telenor parties agreed to lend the necessary funds to vimpelcom ltd. in equal proportions on commercially reasonable terms. termination subject to certain exceptions, the shareholders agreement will be terminated at the earlier of the date on which altimo and telenor each agree in writing and six months after the date on which either the alfa shareholders or the telenor shareholders collectively

vimpelcom ltd.&#146;s securities held by the parties to the registration rights agreement in order to facilitate the sale and distribution of such securities in an underwritten offering. in addition, vimpelcom ltd. agreed to file a registration statement and all necessary amendments and supplements covering any such securities; to ensure that such securities are qualified for offer and sale under applicable law; to furnish copies of any registration statement, prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to legal counsel for each shareholder participating in such offering and the underwriters at least five days before filing; and to use its best efforts to maintain the listing of its adrs on the nyse. vimpelcom ltd. will not, however, be obligated to effect a registration (a) within six months after the effective date of a prior registration statement; (b) for a period of not more than 90 days past the date upon which the supervisory board determines in its good faith judgment that the filing of a registration statement would be seriously detrimental to the completion of a merger or consolidation in which vimpelcom ltd. is a participant; or (c) if vimpelcom ltd. has effected the registration and permitted the sale of securities pursuant to the registration rights agreement on at least six prior occasions. each shareholder&#146;s ability to dispose of securities upon the effectiveness of a registration statement is limited, and shareholders are required to notify vimpelcom ltd. of any changes in any plans of distribution following effectiveness of a registration statement. in addition, each shareholder selling securities pursuant to a registration statement must meet certain requirements, such as being named as a selling security holder in the prospectus, delivering a prospectus to purchasers, accepting civil liability provisions under the securities act in connection with any sales of registered securities; and consenting to be bound by the applicable provisions of the registration rights agreement. each shareholder also agreed to furnish to vimpelcom ltd. information about itself, the securities held by it and its proposed plan of
