("c-4") and the issuer entered into a non-binding interim plan of arrangement agreement (the "letter of intent") relating to a proposed amalgamation among inprimis, the issuer and c-4 pursuant to which all holders of issuer common stock would become shareholders of inprimis and issuer would become a wholly owned subsidiary of inprimis (such proposed amalgamation hereinafter referred to as the "plan of arrangement"). in connection with the letter of intent, on october 12, 2001, inprimis, c-4, glencoe group llc ("glencoe") and certain other parties entered into a share exchange agreement (the "share exchange agreement") pursuant to which c-4 and glencoe agreed, subject to certain conditions, to transfer all of their shares of issuer common stock to inprimis in exchange for shares of its common stock (the "share exchange"). in the event the conditions are not satisfied such that the share exchange is not consummated, each of c-4 and glencoe have agreed to enter into a lock-up agreement (as defined below). as an inducement for inprimis to enter into the letter of intent and share exchange agreement, and in consideration thereof, certain of the directors and officers and other shareholders of the issuer set forth on schedule b each entered into a lock-up agreement with inprimis (each a "lock-up agreement"). pursuant to the lock-up agreements, each such director, officer or other shareholder agreed to vote the shares of issuer common stock beneficially owned by him in favor of the plan of arrangement and against any competing transaction. inprimis did not pay additional consideration to any such director, officer or other shareholder of issuer in connection with the execution and delivery of the lock-up agreements. item 4. purpose of transaction. ---------------------- (a) - (b) as described in item 3 above, this statement relates to the share exchange and plan of arrangement. based on the current capitalization of the issuer and inprimis, inprimis will hold 40.472% of the issued and outstanding issuer common stock upon consummation of the share exchange agreement, and 100% of the issuer common stock upon consummation of the plan of arrangement. simultaneously with the entering into of the share exchange agreement, and pursuant to its terms, eduard will, president and ceo of inprimis, c-4 and another investor entered into a private placement agreement under which inprimis will, subject to certain conditions, issue 4,000,000 shares of a newly created class of series a preferred stock in consideration of an aggregate purchase price of $500,000 (the "private placement"). the share exchange under the share exchange agreement, c-4 and glencoe, which together hold an aggregate of 17,759,000 shares of issuer common stock representing 40.472% of the issued and outstanding issuer common stock, will transfer all of their shares to inprimis in exchange for 26,638,500 shares of inprimis common stock representing approximately 70% of the then issued and outstanding --------------------------- ------------------- cusip no. 237921200 13d page 5 of 12 pages --------------------------- ------------------- common stock of inprimis (the "share exchange"). the rate of exchange will be one share of issuer common stock for one and one-half (1 1/2) shares of inprimis common stock. because inprimis's articles of incorporation do not presently authorize a sufficient number of its common shares to effect the exchange, inprimis will, immediately upon the closing of the share exchange, issue 11,400,000 shares (representing 43% of the new shares) to c-4 and glencoe and will give to c-4 an interest-free subordinated promissory note in the amount of $4,571,550 that will convert into the balance of 15,238,500 shares on or prior to the close of business on july 1, 2002, provided inprimis's shareholders approve the necessary increase of its authorized common stock. upon the closing of the share exchange agreement, the agreement provides that inprimis shall use its best efforts to reconstitute its board of directors to consist of nine persons, with six directors appointed by c-4 and three directors being retained from the existing board. the share exchange agreement provides that, until the earlier of the closing of the plan of arrangement and the termination of the share exchange agreement by its terms, inprimis and its representatives, without the consent of c-4 or as required to comply with inprimis's directors' fiduciary duty, shall refrain from initiating or discussing or otherwise facilitating any inquiries or proposals for the sale, consolidation or similar transaction relating to all or any part of its business operations or for 20% or more of its outstanding capital stock, other than in connection with the plan of arrangement. closing of the share exchange agreement is subject to the granting of an exemption by nasdaq from its rule that an issuer receive shareholder approval of any issuance of greater than 20% of the voting power of its outstanding stock at the time of issuance. in the event the exemption from nasdaq is not obtained, the share exchange agreement provides that c-4 and glencoe will each enter into a lock-up agreement. the private placement pursuant to the private placement agreement, mr. will, c-4 and another investor have subscribed for 2,000,000, 1,600,000 and 400,000 shares, respectively, of a newly created class of series a preferred stock of inprimis, par value $0.01 per share, at a price of $0.125 per share. the aggregate proceeds from the private placement of $500,000 are intended for inprimis's current working capital needs. the series a preferred stock will have the same voting rights as the common stock of inprimis. contingent on approval by inprimis's shareholders of sufficient authorized common stock of inprimis, the series a preferred stock will be convertible into inprimis common shares (at a conversion rate of one for one) at inprimis's election at any time on or prior to the close of business on july 1, 2002. alternatively, at any time on or prior to the close of business on july 1, 2002, (and subject to the legal availability of funds therefor) inprimis may, at its option, redeem any or all of such shares in exchange for $0.125 (u.s.) per share of series a preferred stock and, for every two --------------------------- ------------------- cusip no. 237921200 13d page 6 of 12 pages --------------------------- ------------------- such shares to be redeemed, a one-year warrant for the purchase of a share of common stock of inprimis at an exercise price of $0.20 (u.s.). immediately following the close of business on july 1, 2002, any such shares issued and outstanding will automatically convert into common stock of inprimis at a conversion rate of one for one, except that any such shares that may not be so converted due to insufficient authorized and unissued common stock of inprimis shall be mandatorily redeemed on the terms described above. the closing of the private placement is subject to the granting of an exemption by nasdaq from its rule that an issuer receive shareholder approval of any issuance of greater than 20% of the voting power of its outstanding stock at the time of issuance, or, in the alternative, receipt of such shareholder approval. the plan of arrangement the letter of intent contemplates that issuer and inprimis will negotiate and execute a definitive plan of arrangement agreement substantially on the terms set forth in the letter of intent. the letter of intent provides that at the closing of the plan of arrangement: (i) all current holders of shares of issuer common stock will transfer their shares to an inprimis subsidiary in exchange for freely trading shares of common stock of inprimis at the rate of exchange of one share of issuer common stock for one and one-half (1 1/2) shares of inprimis common stock and (ii) all current holders of warrants and options for the purchase of issuer common stock will exchange such warrants and options for warrants and options on substantially similar terms to purchase shares of common stock of inprimis, with each such warrant or option for the purchase of a share of issuer common stock entitling the holder thereof to a warrant or option, as applicable, for the purchase of one and one-half (1 1/2) shares of inprimis common stock. upon completion of the plan of arrangement, it is anticipated that the current holders of issuer common stock will hold 84.99% of the outstanding shares of inprimis common stock (81.6% on a fully diluted basis), making current holders of issuer common stock majority owners of inprimis. the letter of intent contemplates that, upon the closing of the plan of arrangement, inprimis shall be governed by a board of directors consisting of nine directors, and that, for one year following the closing, six directors shall be appointed by the management of issuer and three directors shall be appointed by the current management of inprimis. the letter of intent provides that until the earlier of: the closing of the plan of arrangement or termination of the letter of intent by its terms, each of inprimis and issuer shall (i) refrain from discussing the acquisition or sale of all or any part of its business operations, except among each other or as required by law and (ii) without the written consent of the other, issue any securities, enter into contracts or otherwise act outside of the normal course of business, make payments to any related party except in the normal course of business, sell or negotiate to sell material assets of their business, or take any other action that would be considered by a prudent businessperson to materially and adversely affect inprimis or issuer, as applicable. --------------------------- ------------------- cusip no. 237921200 13d page 7 of 12 pages --------------------------- ------------------- closing of the plan of arrangement will be conditioned upon: o receipt of the board of directors of inprimis and issuer, respectively, of an opinion of valuation consultants that the transaction is fair to their respective shareholders; o the adoption of the plan of arrangement by the board of directors of inprimis and issuer, respectively; o the approval of the plan of arrangement by the requisite vote of the shareholders of issuer; o the approval of a majority of the shareholders of inprimis of additional authorized common stock sufficient to effect the plan of arrangement; o receipt of all necessary material consents of third parties to the plan of arrangement and the absence of any legal impediments to completing the plan of arrangement on its terms; o receipt of a ruling from a court of competent jurisdiction that the plan of arrangement is fair to the parties and their shareholders; and, o neither inprimis nor issuer having filed for bankruptcy, become the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or other insolvency proceeding or had a receiver appointed for its assets. the lock-up agreements as described above, certain directors, executive officers and other shareholders of issuer, representing 6.5% of its voting stock, have entered into lock-up agreements with inprimis. also, if the share exchange agreement is not consummated, then c-4 and glencoe will enter into lock-up agreements with inprimis covering their shares of issuer common stock which represent 40.472% of issuer's issued and outstanding common stock. c-4 also holds warrants for the purchase of 3,000,000 shares of issuer common stock. to the extent c-4 exercises any of such warrants, the share exchange agreement provides that c-4 must vote the shares of issuer common stock issued pursuant to such warrants in favor of the plan of arrangement. if c-4 enters into a lock-up agreement, any shares of issuer common stock issued pursuant to exercise of any such warrants will be subject to the lock-up agreement. each party to a lock-up agreement is hereinafter referred to as a lock-up shareholder. each lock-up shareholder has, or shall have, (1) agreed to vote such lock-up shareholder's shares of issuer common stock in favor of the plan of arrangement at a shareholders meeting called for the purpose of approving the plan of arrangement; (2) agreed not to, and to use its best efforts to cause its representatives and advisors not to, directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage (including, without limitation, by way of furnishing information) any proposed transaction (as defined in the lock-up agreement); (3) agreed to enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a proposed transaction or furnish to any other person any information with respect to the business, properties, operations, prospects or conditions (financial or otherwise) of issuer or inprimis or their subsidiaries or a proposed transaction or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt of any other person to do or seek to do any of the --------------------------- ------------------- cusip no. 237921200 13d page 8 of 12 pages --------------------------- ------------------- foregoing; (4) agreed (a) not to without the prior consent of inprimis, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey or mortgage, pledge or hypothecate any of such lock-up shareholder's shares of issuer common stock, or such lock-up shareholder's interest therein, except pursuant to the plan of arrangement; (b) not to exercise any shareholder rights or remedies available at common law or pursuant to applicable securities or corporate laws to delay, hinder, upset or challenge the plan of arrangement; (c) it will exercise all voting rights attached to such lock-up shareholder's shares of issuer common stock to vote against any resolution to be considered by the shareholders of issuer that, if approved, could reasonably be considered to reduce the likelihood of success of the plan of arrangement; and (d) it will not, directly or indirectly, take any action whatsoever which may prohibit, impede or otherwise negatively impact on the transaction. pursuant to the lock-up agreements, if the transaction and plan of arrangement are not approved by the requisite vote of issuer common stock, or if for any other reason the transaction does not close as contemplated by the interim plan of arrangement agreement, the lock-up shareholders agree to exchange their shares of issuer common stock for shares of inprimis common stock on the same terms and conditions provided in the share exchange agreement. the lock-up agreements may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the plan of arrangement by written notice to the non-terminating party (1) by mutual written consent of the parties; (2) by either inprimis or the lock-up shareholder if the circular (as defined in the lock-up agreement) is not mailed to holders of issuer common stock prior to december 22, 2001, or such later date as the parties shall have agreed in writing; (3) by either inprimis or the lock-up shareholder if the transaction is not closed within two (2) months of the closing date unless the failure to so close shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the lock-up agreement to perform the obligations under the lock-up agreement required to be performed by it; and (4) by either inprimis or the lock-up shareholder if a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the transaction, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate the lock-up agreement shall have used all commercially reasonable commercial efforts to remove such order, decree, ruling or injunction. the foregoing rights granted to inprimis pursuant to the terms of the lock-up agreements are referred to herein as the "lock-up rights." other than as set forth above, neither inprimis, nor to inprimis's knowledge, any of the persons set forth on schedule a have any right or power to vote, direct the voting of, dispose of or direct the disposition of the issuer common stock reported on this statement. the summaries of the share exchange
