markets. reporting party is currently in negotiations with two other shareholders of issuer to acquire 1,100,000 shares of issuer's stock. reporting party may seek to purchase other shares of issuer from other shareholders, but is not currently in negotiations with any other shareholders to purchase additional shares. on august 23, 2000, reporting party and issuer entered into a transaction involving the formation of a german company named nurescell ag to be owned 51% by issuer and 49% by reporting party. the investment agreement executed incident to the august 23, 2000 transaction provides that nurescell ag has the right to acquire up to $4,000,000 of issuer's stock for a period of five (5) years at 80% of the bid price of issuer determined at specified times. the investment

issuer's proprietary nuclear shielding technology in europe and russia, the term of which license expires august 15, 2020 or when certain patents expire which have been applied for by issuer, whichever later occurs. the license agreement provides for the payment of a license fee of $1,000,000 to issuer, to be paid quarterly unless $4,000,000 in capital is raised by nurescell ag, in which case the entire $1,000,000 is due in its entirety. reporting party is contributing $1,000,000 to nurescell ag for its 49% interest in nurescell ag which will, in turn, be used by nurescell ag to pay the license fee. the investment agreement executed incident to the august 23, 2000 transaction also provides for various changes to be made to the management and directors: mr. william a. wilson was to resign as president (but retain his position as chairman of the board) and mr. james samuelson was to be named president of issuer. both of these events occurred. mr. samuelson is a vice president,

have failed to promptly assume the defense of such action, claim, or proceeding, or (iii) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party and that the assertion of such defenses would create a conflict of interest such that counsel employed by the indemnifying party could not faithfully represent the indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, claim, or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action, claim, or proceeding, or separate but substantially similar or related actions, claims, or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, unless in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such action, claim, or proceeding, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels). the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent. section 12 contribution ------------ if the indemnification provided for in this agreement is unavailable to an indemnified party under section 9 or section 10 hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in such sections) in respect of any losses, then each applicable indemnifying party in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions, statements, or omissions which resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and the indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, omission, or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the partys' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement, or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 11 hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 12 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 12, joseph shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the shares sold by it exceeds the amount of any damages which such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11 (f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. section 13 right of first refusal ---------------------- in lieu of registering any shares under this agreement pursuant to section 2 or 3 hereof or rendering an opinion pursuant to

stock assignment separate from certificate and such other documents as company may reasonably demand. section 14 lock in ------- notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, joseph shall be prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, or encumbering the shares in any manner except to the extent of 600,000 shares per year as provided for in this agreement, provided, however, that joseph may sell, assign, transfer, or encumber the shares or any portion thereof to any person or entity provided that said person or entity specifically assume and agrees to be bound by the
