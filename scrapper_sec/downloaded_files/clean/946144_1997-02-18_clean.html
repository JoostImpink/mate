located at avenue olivier perroy, 13790 rousset, france. item 2.	 identity and background 	this statement is being filed by motorola, inc., a delaware corporation ("motorola"). motorola's principal executive offices are located at 1303 east algonquin road, schaumburg, il 60196. motorola, one of the world's leading providers of electronic equipment, systems, components and services for worldwide markets, is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale, principally under the motorola brand, of a diversified line of such products. 	the names, business addresses and present principal occupations of the directors and executive officers of motorola are set forth in the attached appendix i, which is incorporated by reference. appendix i also lists the principal business of any employer that employs a director who is not also an executive officer of motorola. to the best of motorola's knowledge, all directors and executive officers of motorola are citizens of the united states. 	neither motorola nor, to the best of motorola's knowledge, any director or executive officer of motorola listed on the attached appendix i has been, during the last five years, (a) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (b) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration 	the consideration for the 463,708 shares and the warrant (as defined in item 4) acquired by motorola consists of $686,686 cash and the assignment to pixtech of motorola's right to receive $1,500,000 from a subsidiary of pixtech, under the terms of the dlc patent cross-license agreement dated june 13, 1996 between motorola and pixtech, s.a., a subsidiary of pixtech (the "diamond license"). motorola has funded the cash consideration for the purchase of such shares and the warrant out of working capital. as further consideration for motorola's investment, motorola and pixtech will amend certain licensing and other terms in their existing cooperation and licensing agreement dated june 13, 1995 (the "cooperation agreement"). item 4.	 purpose of transaction 	motorola and pixtech have entered into a stock purchase agreement dated february 6, 1997 (the "spa") pursuant to which motorola agreed to purchase 463,708 shares. in addition, motorola received a warrant to purchase an additional 463,708 shares at an exercise price per share of $5.50, exercisable at any time up to december 31, 1998 (the "warrant"). the transactions contemplated by the spa were consummated as of february 14, 1997. 	pursuant to the spa, upon motorola's exercise of the warrant, pixtech will use its best efforts, at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors, to enlarge the number of members of the board and to elect a representative designated by motorola in writing to fill the vacancy so created. prior to the exercise of the warrant a representative of motorola will be permitted to observe (but not vote at) the board meetings. 	since 1995 motorola has participated, with pixtech and other parties, in a flat emission display alliance (the "fed alliance"). in june, 1995 motorola and pixtech entered into the cooperation agreement pursuant to which motorola has licensed certain flat emission display technology to pixtech (granting pixtech further rights to sublicense such technology to fed alliance members and others subject to the terms of the cooperation license). in connection with the purchase of the shares and warrants, pixtech and motorola are amending the cooperation agreement. 	motorola has acquired the shares and the warrant and entered into the amendment of the cooperation agreement described in this item 4 in order to provide additional working capital to pixtech and to participate to a greater extent in any future growth and success of pixtech. except as set forth in this item 4, neither motorola, nor to the best of motorola's knowledge, any of its executive officers or directors, has any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions or events specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. notwithstanding the foregoing, motorola may determine to change its investment intent with respect to pixtech at any time in the future. in reaching any conclusion as to its future course of action, motorola will take into consideration such factors as it deems relevant, including the business and prospects of pixtech, future developments concerning pixtech, other business opportunities available to motorola, developments with respect to the business of motorola, and general economic, financial and market conditions. motorola reserves the right to acquire additional securities of pixtech in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions (which may be with pixtech or third parties) or otherwise, to dispose of all or a portion of its holdings of securities of pixtech or to change its intention with respect to any or all of the matters referred to in this item 4. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer 	(a) 	as of february 14, 1997, motorola was the beneficial owner (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) of 927,416 shares, of which 463,708 shares are issuable upon exercise of motorola's warrant. this total represents 6.8% of all outstanding shares, based on information furnished to motorola by pixtech as of february 14, 1997 stating that 13,248,807 shares were outstanding as of february 14, 1997 and, after giving effect to the transactions described in item 4, 13,712,515 shares were outstanding as of february 14, 1997. to the best knowledge of motorola, no shares are beneficially owned by any of its executive officers or directors, nor do such executive officers and directors have the right to acquire any shares.

expenses in connection with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section 11 and the registration of the shares pursuant to the registration statement, other than fees and

director, employee, agent, affiliate or person deemed to be in control of motorola within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act; (b) the term "registration statement" shall mean any final prospectus, exhibit, supplement or amendment included in or relating to the registration statement referred to in section 11.1; and (c) the term "untrue statement" shall mean any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of, or any omission or alleged omission to state, in the registration statement a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. pixtech agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each selling stockholder from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such selling stockholder may become subject (under the securities act or otherwise) insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement on the effective date thereof, or arise out of any failure by pixtech to fulfill any undertaking included in the registration statement and pixtech will reimburse such selling stockholder for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that pixtech shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of, or is based upon, an untrue statement made in such registration statement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to pixtech by or on behalf of such selling stockholder specifically for use in preparation of the registration statement, or any statement or omission in any prospectus that is corrected in any subsequent prospectus that was delivered to motorola prior to the pertinent sale or sales by motorola. motorola agrees to indemnify and hold harmless pixtech (and each person, if any, who controls pixtech within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, each officer of pixtech who signs the registration statement and each director of pixtech) from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which pixtech (or any such officer, director or controlling person) may become subject (under the securities act or otherwise), insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement on the effective date thereof if such untrue statement was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of motorola specifically for use in preparation of the registration statement, and motorola will reimburse pixtech (or such officer, director or controlling person, as the case may be), for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, defending, or preparing to defend any such action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that motorola shall not be liable for any statement or omission in any prospectus that is corrected in any subsequent prospectus that was delivered to motorola prior to the pertinent sale or sales by motorola. promptly after receipt by any indemnified person of a notice of a claim or the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity is to be sought against an indemnifying person pursuant to this section 11.2, such indemnified person shall notify the indemnifying person in writing of such claim or of the commencement of such action, and, subject to the provisions hereinafter stated, in case any such action shall be brought against an indemnified person and such indemnifying person shall have been notified thereof, such indemnifying person shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person. after notice from the indemnifying person to such indemnified persons of its election to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying person shall not be liable to such indemnified person for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified person in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that if there exists or shall exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate, in the opinion of counsel to the indemnified person, for the same counsel to represent both the indemnified person and such indemnifying person or any officer, director, employee, agent, affiliate or person deemed to be in control of such indemnifying person within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, the indemnified person shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the expense of such indemnifying person. it is understood, however, that pixtech shall, in connection with any one such action, suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, suits, or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of only one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties not having actual or potential differing interests with pixtech or among themselves. 11.3 "stand-off" agreement. if motorola holds any shares at such time as pixtech proposes to offer shares of its common stock or other securities for sale in a registered public offering, then motorola agrees not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any such shares or other securities of pixtech held by it during the period commencing 10 days prior to, and expiring 180 days after, such registered public offering has become effective, provided, that all executive officers and directors of pixtech enter into similar agreements. pixtech may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares or other securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of any stand-off period. 11.4 termination. motorola's registration rights hereunder shall terminate as to any shares or warrant shares when such shares or warrant shares are no longer held by motorola. section 12. board attendance and representation. 12.1 observation rights. until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the warrant, (ii) the sale by motorola of any of the shares or (iii) the election of a representative of motorola to the board of directors of pixtech pursuant to section 12.2 hereof, pixtech shall permit one representative of motorola to attend, at motorola's expense, all meetings of the board of directors of pixtech, and of any other committee or group exercising responsibilities comparable to those exercised by the board of directors, as non-participating observers of such meetings. the company shall give each purchaser such notice and materials of any such meeting as shall be given to members of the board of directors or committees thereof. 12.2 election of board representative. in the event that motorola exercises the warrant in full, and has not at such time sold any of the shares, pixtech will use its best efforts to (i) at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors following such exercise, cause the directors to enlarge the number of members of the board and to elect a representative designated by motorola in writing to fill the vacancy so created (to the extent permitted by pixtech's restated by-laws and restated certificate of incorporation and applicable law) and (ii) thereafter support the reelection of such representative until motorola sells any of its shares of pixtech common stock; provided that the cashless exercise of the warrant pursuant to the conversion right (as defined in section 2.3 of the warrant) shall not constitute a sale of any shares of pixtech common stock for purposes of this section 12.2. if such representative of motorola resigns or is removed from the board of directors at any time that pixtech remains obligated pursuant to this section 12.2, then pixtech shall use its best efforts to cause a successor designated by motorola in writing to be elected to fill the vacancy created by such resignation or removal. section 13. survival of representations, warranties and agreements; assignibility of rights. notwithstanding any investigation made by any party to this agreement, all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by pixtech and motorola herein, except as otherwise provided herein, shall survive the execution of this agreement, the delivery to motorola of the shares and the warrant being purchased and the payment therefor. except as otherwise provided herein, (i) the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the company made herein shall bind the company's successors and assigns and shall insure to the benefit of motorola's successors and assigns and to transferees of the warrant and (ii) the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of motorola made herein shall bind motorola's successors and assigns and shall insure to the benefit of pixtech's successors and assigns. section 14. miscellaneous. 14.1 notices. any consent, notice or report required or permitted to be given or made under this

shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and (b) the number of warrant shares for which this warrant may be exercised immediately before such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the exercise price immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the exercise price immediately after such event. 5. reorganizations. in case of any capital reorganization or reclassification of the common stock, or any consolidation or merger of the company with or into another corporation (other than a merger or consolidation in which the company is the continuing corporation and which does not
