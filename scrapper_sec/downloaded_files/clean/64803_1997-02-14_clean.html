whereas, for united states federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the merger contemplated by this agreement qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of section 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "code"); whereas, for accounting purposes, it is intended that the merger be accounted for as a pooling of interests under united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"); and whereas, as a condition and inducement to cvs entering into this agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement, cvs is entering into a stockholder agreement with zell/chilmark fund, l.p. ("zell/chilmark") in the form of exhibit a hereto (the "zell/chilmark stockholder agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholder has agreed to vote the shares of revco common stock owned by such stockholder in favor of this agreement and the merger provided for herein; now, therefore, in consideration of the promises and the respective representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth herein and in the zell/chilmark stockholder agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: article 1 the merger section 1.01. the merger. (a) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement, at the effective time, merger subsidiary shall be merged (the "merger") with and into revco in accordance with the delaware general corporation law (the "delaware law"), whereupon the separate existence of merger subsidiary shall cease, and revco shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation"). (b) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, the closing of the merger (the "closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties (the "closing date"), which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in article 6, at the offices of davis polk & wardwell, 450 lexington avenue, new york, new york 10017, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. (c) upon the closing, revco and merger subsidiary will file a certificate of merger with the secretary of state of the state of delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by delaware law in connection with the merger. the merger shall become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware or at such later time as is agreed by cvs and revco and specified in the certificate of merger (the "effective time"). (d) the merger shall have the effects set forth in section 259 of the delaware law. section 1.02. conversion of shares. (a) at the effective time: (i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of revco (the "revco common stock") held by revco as treasury stock or owned by cvs or any subsidiary of cvs immediately prior to the effective time shall be cancelled, and no cvs common stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; (ii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of merger subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the surviving corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation; and (iii) each share (each, a "share" and collectively, the "shares") of revco common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall, except as otherwise provided in section 1.02(a)(i), be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of fully paid and non-assessable common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "cvs common stock"), of cvs equal to the sum of: (x) 0.4692 (the "fixed number"); and (y) that number (the "calculated number") (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) determined by dividing $20 by the cvs average closing price; provided that the calculated number shall not exceed 0.5405 and shall not be less than 0.4145. for purposes of this agreement, "cvs average closing price" means the average closing price per share of the cvs common stock on the new york stock exchange, inc. (the "nyse") for the random trading days; and "random trading days" means the ten trading days selected by lot out of the twenty trading days ending on and including the fifth trading day preceding the closing date. the random trading days shall be selected by lot by cvs and revco at 5:00 p.m. new york time on the fifth trading day prior to the closing date. the sum of the fixed number and the calculated number is referred to herein as the "conversion number". (b) from and after the effective time, all shares converted in accordance with section 1.02(a)(iii) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the merger consideration and any dividends payable pursuant to section 1.03(f). from and after the effective time, all certificates representing the common stock of merger subsidiary shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation into which they were converted in accordance with section 1.02(a)(ii). (c) the cvs common stock to be received as consideration pursuant to the merger by each holder of shares (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of cvs common stock) is referred to herein as the "merger consideration". (d) for purposes of this agreement, the word "subsidiary" when used with respect to any person means any other person, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such person or by any one or more of its subsidiaries. for purposes of this agreement, "person" means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization, including a governmental authority. section 1.03. surrender and payment. (a) prior to the effective time, cvs shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to revco (the "exchange agent") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing shares for the merger consideration. immediately following the effective time, cvs shall deposit with the exchange agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of revco common stock, certificates representing the cvs common stock issuable pursuant to section 1.02 in exchange for outstanding shares of revco common stock. promptly after the effective time, cvs will send, or will cause the exchange agent to send, to each holder of shares at the effective time (i) a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that delivery of the merger consideration shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates representing cvs common stock and revco common stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates representing shares to the exchange agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates representing shares in exchange for the certificates representing cvs common stock. (b) each holder of shares that have been converted into a right to receive the merger consideration, upon surrender to the exchange agent of a certificate or certificates representing such shares, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal covering such shares, will be entitled to receive the merger consideration payable in respect of such shares and any dividends payable pursuant to section 1.03(f). until so surrendered, each such certificate shall, after the effective time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the merger consideration and any dividends payable pursuant to section 1.03(f). (c) if any portion of the merger consideration is to be paid to a person other than the registered holder of the shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of cvs common stock to a person other than the registered holder of such shares represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. (d) after the effective time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares. if, after the effective time, certificates representing shares are presented to the surviving corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this article 1. (e) any portion of the merger consideration made available to the exchange agent pursuant to section 1.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares six months after the effective time shall be returned to cvs, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his shares for the merger consideration in accordance with this section 1.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to cvs for payment of the merger consideration and any dividends payable pursuant to section 1.03(f) in respect of his shares. notwithstanding the foregoing, cvs shall not be liable to any holder of shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares seven years after the effective time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of cvs free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
