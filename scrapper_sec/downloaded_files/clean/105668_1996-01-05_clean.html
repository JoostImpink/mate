(the "trustee"), a copy of which is filed as exhibit 6 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference, entered into a subscription agreement dated december 29, 1995 (the "subscription agreement") under which the trust subscribed for and the company agreed to issue to the trust 16,450,000 common shares (the "subscribed shares"). the subscribed shares 5 are to be paid for with exchangeable shares. a copy of the subscription agreement is filed as exhibit 7 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. the purpose of the subscription agreement is to provide voting rights to the reporting person which are equivalent to the voting rights that he would have if he were a holder of common shares. the subscribed shares, although not issued, provide the trust, in accordance with ohio law, with certain rights equivalent to those of a shareholder of the company, including the right to that number of votes at meetings of shareholders of the company equal to the number of common shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the exchange right. under the terms of the trust agreement, the reporting person has the sole right to direct the voting rights of the subscribed shares and to direct the trustee to complete the subscription and pay for the subscribed shares upon delivery to the trustee of an equal number of exchangeable shares in payment of the subscription price for the subscribed shares. under a guaranty agreement dated december 29, 1995 between the reporting person and the trust (the "guaranty agreement"), a copy of which is filed as exhibit 8 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference, the reporting person has guaranteed that he will deliver the exchangeable shares to the trust to enable the trust to pay for the subscribed shares unless the subscription agreement has been terminated as a result of there being no exchangeable shares outstanding except those held by the company. the exercise by the reporting person of the exchange right or the retraction right will result in the company being the only holder of the exchangeable shares and therefore the termination of the subscription agreement, with the result that the subscribed shares will not be paid for or issued. dividends under the terms of the exchangeable shares, the holder is entitled to receive dividends on each exchangeable share which are equivalent to the dividends declared on the common shares. the support agreement provides for the company to cause newco to be provided with such assets or funds as necessary to enable newco to declare and make payment of such equivalent dividends. escrowed shares the reporting person, the company, newco and the trust company of bank of montreal, as the escrow agent, are also party to an escrow agreement dated december 29, 1995 (the "escrow agreement") pursuant to which 411,250 of the exchangeable shares issued to the reporting person are held in escrow in connection with any claim for indemnification by the company against the reporting person, for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants in the share purchase agreement. any common shares received by the reporting person in exchange for exchangeable shares held in escrow will be held in escrow in accordance with the escrow agreement. a copy of the escrow agreement is filed as exhibit 9 and is incorporated herein by reference. resale of common shares under the share purchase agreement, the reporting person has agreed not to dispose of the common shares of the company issued to him upon exchange of the exchangeable shares unless such disposition has been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 act"), such disposition complies with rule 144 under the 1933 act or such disposition is exempt from the 1933 act. the exchange agreement obliges the reporting person to sell any common shares in compliance with all applicable securities laws and use his best efforts not to sell such common shares to a person who would beneficially own more than 5% of the common shares after giving effect to such purchase, other than a person who would be entitled to file a schedule 13g under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, with respect to such sale. a registration rights agreement between the reporting person and the company dated december 29, 1995 (the "registration rights agreement") obliges the company to register the common shares issued to the reporting person for resale in the united states by filing a registration statement under the 1933 act when requested by the reporting person, subject to certain conditions, and to list such shares on the new york stock exchange. the reporting person has been granted the right to request a registration at any time 6 after the company files with the securities and exchange commission financial statements including as least 30 days of combined operating results of the company and newco. the registration rights agreement further provides, among other things, that the company shall not be obligated to file more than eight requested registration statements. a copy of the registration rights agreement is filed as exhibit 10 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. except as described herein, the reporting person does not have any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the company, including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees or profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit 1 -- share purchase agreement exhibit 2 -- amendment to

section 1.2.2(b) with respect to all such newco exchangeable shares. as of and with effect from the automatic exchange date, seller shall cease to be the holder of the newco exchangeable shares

hereinbefore provided. wendy's shall have the right to deposit or cause to be deposited in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in canada (the "wendy's liquidation amount

deposited against presentation and -4- 5 surrender of the certificates representing such newco exchangeable shares to the wendy's liquidation amount depositary. upon such payment or deposit of the wendy's liquidation amount, seller shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the wendy's common shares either (i) delivered to him or the escrow agent, as the case may be, or (ii) deposited with the wendy's liquidation amount depositary. 1.3. exercise of exchange right subsequent to retraction. in the event that seller has exercised his right under article 6 of

full on all of the exchangeable shares then outstanding, any such dividends that remain unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by the board of directors on which the corporation shall have sufficient moneys, assets or property properly applicable to the payment of such dividends. 5 article 4 certain restrictions 4.1 so long as any of the exchangeable shares are outstanding, the corporation shall not at any time without, but may at any time with, the approval of the holders of the exchangeable shares given as specified in section 11.2 of these share provisions: (a) pay any dividends on the common shares or on any other shares ranking junior to the exchangeable shares, other than stock dividends payable in common shares, or any such other shares ranking junior to the exchangeable shares, as the case may be; (b) redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of common shares or any other shares ranking junior to the exchangeable shares; (c) redeem or purchase any other shares of the corporation ranking equally with, or superior to, the exchangeable shares with respect to the payment of dividends or on any liquidation distribution; or (d) issue any exchangeable shares or any other shares of the corporation ranking equally with, or superior to, the exchangeable shares other than by way of stock dividends to the holders of exchangeable shares. the restrictions in sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b) and 4.1(c) above shall not apply if all dividends on the outstanding exchangeable shares required by section 3.1 to have been declared and paid on the exchangeable shares have been declared and paid in full. article 5 distribution on liquidation 5.1 in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the corporation or any other distribution of the assets of the corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of exchangeable shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable law, the exercise by wendy's of the liquidation call right, and the terms of the escrow agreement to receive from the assets of the corporation in respect of each exchangeable share held by the holder on the date on which the assets of the corporation are distributed to its shareholders (the "liquidation date") in connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, in priority to any distribution of any part of the assets of the corporation among the holders of the common shares, or any other shares ranking junior to the exchangeable shares, an amount per share equal to (a) the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of the specified number of wendy's common shares on the last business day prior to the liquidation date, which shall be satisfied in full by the corporation causing to be delivered to such holder (or to the escrow agent in the case of exchangeable shares then being held in escrow pursuant to the escrow agreement) the specified number of wendy's common shares, plus (b) an additional amount equivalent to the amount by which the declared and unpaid dividends on one exchangeable share exceed, if at all, the declared and unpaid dividends on the specified number of wendy's common shares (calculated as of the date of declaration of such dividend or dividends in accordance with the provisions hereof) (collectively the "liquidation amount"). 5.2 on or promptly after the liquidation date, and subject to the exercise by wendy's of the liquidation call right, the corporation shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the exchangeable shares (or the escrow agent, if such exchangeable shares are then held in escrow 6 pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement) the liquidation amount for each exchangeable share upon presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such exchangeable shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of exchangeable shares under the act and the by-laws of the corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the corporation may reasonably require, at the registered office of the corporation. payment of the total liquidation amount for such exchangeable shares shall be made by delivery to each holder or the escrow agent, as the case may be, at the address of the holder or the escrow agent, as the case may be, recorded in the securities register of the corporation for the exchangeable shares or by holding (as specified in writing by such holder or the escrow agent) for pick up by the holder or the escrow agent, as the case may be, at the registered office of the corporation of certificates representing the specified number of wendy's common shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance other than any escrow requirements imposed by the escrow agreement) with respect to each such exchangeable share (less any wendy's common shares withheld in respect of any tax required to be deducted or withheld therefrom by the corporation) and a cheque of the corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the corporation in respect of the amount specified in section 5.1(b) hereof and comprising part of the total liquidation amount (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the corporation, including, without limitation, united states dividend withholding taxes to the extent the corporation or wendy's believes that such withholding may be required). on and after the liquidation date, the holders of such exchangeable shares shall cease to be holders of such exchangeable shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total liquidation amount, unless payment of the total liquidation amount for such exchangeable shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of share certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected to the extent the liquidation amount has not been paid until the total liquidation amount has been fully paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. the corporation shall have the right at any time after the liquidation date to deposit or cause to be deposited in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in canada the total liquidation amount in respect of the exchangeable shares represented by certificates that have not at the liquidation date been surrendered by the holders thereof or the escrow agent as the case may be and immediately upon making such deposit the corporation shall give notice thereof to the holders of the exchangeable shares. upon such deposit being made, the rights of the holders of exchangeable shares after such deposit shall be limited to the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement, their proportionate part of the total liquidation amount (less any tax required to be deducted or withheld therefrom, including, without limitation, united states dividend withholding taxes to the extent the corporation or wendy's believes that such withholding may be required) for the exchangeable shares with respect to which the liquidation amount has been so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such exchangeable shares to such bank or trust company. upon such payment or deposit of the total liquidation amount, the holders of the exchangeable shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holders of the wendy's common shares either (i) delivered to such holder or the escrow agent, as the case may be, or (ii) deposited with such chartered bank or trust company. 5.3 after the liquidation amount per exchangeable share has been paid or deposited, whether by the corporation pursuant hereto or by wendy's following the exercise of the liquidation call right, holders of exchangeable shares shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of the corporation. 5.4 in paying the liquidation amount the corporation shall not be required to deliver fractional shares of wendy's common shares but in lieu thereof may pay to the holders of exchangeable shares or the escrow agent, as the case may be, in accordance with section 5.2 an 7 amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of one wendy's common share on the last business day prior to the liquidation date. article 6 retraction of exchangeable shares by holder 6.1 subject to the provisions of the act, the exercise by wendy's of the retraction call right and otherwise upon compliance with the provisions of this article 6, a holder of exchangeable shares shall be entitled at any time, to require the corporation to redeem any or all of the exchangeable shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per share equal to (a) the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of the specified number of wendy's common shares on the last business day prior to the retraction date, which shall be satisfied in full by the corporation causing to be delivered to such holder (or to the escrow agent in the case of exchangeable shares then being held in escrow pursuant to the escrow agreement) the specified number of wendy's common shares for each exchangeable share presented and surrendered by the holder, or the escrow agent, as the case may be, plus (b) an additional amount equivalent to the amount, if any, by which the declared and unpaid dividends on one exchangeable share exceed the declared and unpaid dividends on the specified number of wendy's common shares (calculated as of the date of declaration of such dividends in accordance with the provisions hereof) (collectively the "retraction price"). to effect such redemption, the holder shall present and surrender at the registered office of the corporation the certificate or certificates representing the exchangeable shares which the holder desires to have the corporation redeem, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of exchangeable shares under the act and the by-laws of the corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the corporation may reasonably require, and together with a duly executed statement (the "retraction request") in the form of appendix 1 hereto or in such other form as may be acceptable to the corporation: (i) specifying that the holder desires to have all or any number specified therein of the exchangeable shares represented by such certificate or certificates (the "retracted shares") redeemed by the corporation; (ii) stating the business day on which the holder desires to have the corporation redeem the retracted shares (the "retraction date"), provided that the retraction date shall be not less than 10 business days nor more than 15 business days after the date on which the retraction request is received by the corporation and further provided that, in the event that no such business day is specified by the holder in the retraction request, the retraction date shall be deemed to be the tenth business day after the date on which the retraction request is received by the corporation; and (iii) acknowledging the overriding right (the "retraction call right") of wendy's to purchase all but not less than all the retracted shares directly from the holder and that the retraction request shall be deemed to be a revocable offer by the holder to sell the retracted shares to wendy's in accordance with the retraction call right on the terms and conditions set out in section 6.3 below. the holder shall also send a copy of the retraction request to wendy's. 6.2 subject to the exercise by wendy's of the retraction call right, upon receipt by the corporation in the manner specified in section 6.1 hereof of a certificate or certificates representing the number of exchangeable shares which the holder desires to have the corporation redeem, together with a retraction request, and provided that the retraction request is not revoked by the 8 holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the corporation shall redeem the retracted shares effective at the close of business on the retraction date and shall cause to be delivered to such holder (or to the escrow agent in the case of exchangeable shares then being held in escrow pursuant to the escrow agreement) the retraction price with respect to such shares in the manner provided in section 6.4 hereof. if only a part of the exchangeable shares represented by any certificate are redeemed (or purchased by wendy's pursuant to the retraction call right), a new certificate for the balance of such exchangeable shares shall be issued to the holder or to the escrow agent, if applicable, at the expense of the corporation. 6.3 upon receipt by the corporation of a retraction request, the corporation shall immediately notify wendy's thereof. in order to exercise the retraction call right, wendy's must notify the corporation and the holder in writing of its determination to do so (the "retraction call notice") within 5 business days of notification to wendy's by the corporation of the receipt by the corporation of the retraction request. if wendy's does not so notify the corporation within such 5 business day period, the corporation will notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that wendy's will not exercise the retraction call right. if wendy's delivers the retraction call notice within such 5 business day time period, and provided that the retraction request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the retraction request shall thereupon be considered only to be an offer by the holder to sell the retracted shares to wendy's in accordance with the retraction call right. in such event, the corporation shall not redeem the retracted shares and wendy's shall purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to wendy's on the retraction date the retracted shares for a purchase price (the "purchase price") per share equal to the retraction price per share in the manner set forth in the share exchange agreement. in the event that wendy's does not deliver the retraction call notice within such 5 business day period, and provided that the retraction request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the corporation shall redeem the retracted shares on the retraction date and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this article 6. 6.4 on the retraction date, subject to the exercise by wendy's of the retraction call right, the corporation shall deliver to the holder, or the escrow agent, as the case may be, at the address of the holder or the escrow agent, as the case may be, recorded in the securities register of the corporation for the exchangeable shares or at the address specified in the holder's retraction request or by holding for pick up by the holder or the escrow agent, as the case may be, at the registered office of the corporation, as specified in writing by such holder, certificates representing the specified number of wendy's common shares with respect to each such exchangeable share (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance other than any escrow requirement under the escrow agreement) registered in the name of the holder in payment of the total retraction price (less any wendy's common shares withheld in respect of any tax required to be deducted or withheld therefrom by the corporation) and a cheque of the corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the corporation in payment of the additional amount specified in section 6.1 (b) comprising part of the total retraction price (less any tax required to be deducted or withheld therefrom by the corporation, including, without limitation, united states dividend withholding taxes to the extent the corporation or wendy's believes that such withholding may be required) and such delivery of such certificates and cheque on behalf of the corporation shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total retraction price to the extent that the same is represented by such share certificates and cheque (plus any tax required and in fact deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to the proper tax authority) unless such cheque is not paid on due presentation. 6.5 on and after the close of business on the retraction date, the holder of the retracted shares shall cease to be a holder of such retracted shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive, subject to these share provisions and the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement, his proportionate 9 part of the total retraction price unless upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment of the total retraction price shall not be made, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected to the extent payment of the retraction price has not been made until the total retraction price has been fully paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. on and after the close of business on the retraction date, provided that presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the total retraction price or the total purchase price, as the case may be, has been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the retracted shares so redeemed by the corporation or purchased by wendy's shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the wendy's common shares delivered to it. 6.6 notwithstanding any other provision of this article 6, the corporation shall not be obligated to redeem retracted shares specified by a holder in a retraction request to the extent that such redemption of retracted shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law. if the corporation believes that on any retraction date it would not be permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the retracted shares tendered for redemption on such date, and provided that wendy's shall not have exercised the retraction call right with respect to the retracted shares, the corporation shall only be obligated to redeem retracted shares specified by a holder in a retraction request to the extent of the maximum number that may be redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and shall notify the holder at least 2 business days prior to the retraction date as to the number of retracted shares which will not be redeemed by the corporation. in any case in which the redemption by the corporation of retracted shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law, the corporation shall redeem retracted shares in accordance with section 6.4 of these share provisions on a pro rata basis and shall issue to each holder of retracted shares a new certificate, at the expense of the corporation, representing the retracted shares not redeemed by the corporation pursuant to section 6.4 hereof. provided that the retraction request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the holder of any such retracted shares not redeemed by the corporation pursuant to section 6.4 of these share provisions as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law shall be deemed by giving the retraction request to require wendy's to purchase such retracted shares from such holder on the retraction date or as soon as practicable thereafter on payment by wendy's to such holder or to the escrow agent, as applicable, of the purchase price for each such retracted share, all as more specifically provided in the share exchange agreement. 6.7 a holder of retracted shares may, by notice in writing given by the holder to the corporation before the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the retraction date, withdraw its retraction request in which event such retraction request shall be null and void and, for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the retraction request to sell the retracted shares to wendy's shall be deemed to have been revoked. as soon as practicable after having received such withdrawal notice the corporation shall return or cause to be returned, to the holder the exchangeable shares delivered to the corporation pursuant to section 6.1. 6.8 in paying the retraction price the corporation shall not be required to deliver fractional shares of wendy's common shares but in lieu thereof may pay to the holders of exchangeable shares or the escrow agent, as the case may be, in accordance with section 6.4 an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of one wendy's common share on the last business day prior to the retraction date. 10 article 7 redemption of exchangeable shares by the corporation 7.1 subject to applicable law, if directed by wendy's pursuant to the share exchange agreement, the corporation shall on the redemption date redeem the whole of the then outstanding exchangeable shares for an amount per share equal to (a) the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of the specified number of wendy's common shares on the last business day prior to the redemption date, which shall be satisfied in full by the corporation causing to be delivered to each holder of exchangeable shares (or to the escrow agent in the case of exchangeable shares then being held in escrow pursuant to the escrow agreement) the specified number of wendy's common shares for each exchangeable share held by such holder, plus (b) an additional amount equivalent to the amount, if any, by which the declared and unpaid dividends on one exchangeable share exceed the declared and unpaid dividends on the specified number of wendy's common shares (calculated as of the date of declaration of such dividend or dividends in accordance with the provisions hereof) (collectively the "redemption price"). 7.2 in the case of a redemption of exchangeable shares under this article 7, the corporation shall, at least 20 days before the redemption date, send or cause to be sent to each holder of exchangeable shares a notice in writing of the redemption by the corporation of the exchangeable shares held by such holder. such notice shall set out the formula for determining the redemption price and the redemption date. on or after the redemption date, the corporation shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the exchangeable shares to be redeemed the redemption price for each such exchangeable share upon presentation and surrender at the registered office of the corporation certificates representing such exchangeable shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of exchangeable shares under the act and the by-laws of the corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the corporation may reasonably require. payment of the total redemption price for such exchangeable shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, or the escrow agent, as the case may be, at the address of the holder or the escrow agent, as the case may be, recorded in the securities register of the corporation or by holding (as specified in writing by such holder or escrow agent) for pick up by the holder or the escrow agent, as the case may be, at the registered office of the corporation certificates representing the specified number of wendy's common shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance other than any escrow requirements imposed by the escrow agreement) with respect to each such exchangeable share (less any wendy's common shares withheld in respect of any tax required to be deducted or withheld therefrom by the corporation), and a cheque of the corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the corporation in respect of the additional amount specified in section 7.1(b) hereof comprising part of the total redemption price (less any tax required to be deducted or withheld therefrom by the corporation, including, without limitation, united states dividend withholding taxes to the extent the corporation or wendy's believes that such withholding may be required). on and after the redemption date, the holders of the exchangeable shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of such exchangeable shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total redemption price, unless payment of the total redemption price for such exchangeable shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total redemption price has been paid in full in the manner hereinbefore provided. the corporation shall have the right at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the exchangeable shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total redemption price of the exchangeable shares so called for redemption, or of such of the said exchangeable shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof or the escrow agent as the case may be, in connection with such redemption, in a custodial 11 account with any chartered bank or trust company in canada named in such notice and giving notice thereof to the holders of the exchangeable shares. upon the later of such deposit being made and the redemption date, the exchangeable shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after deposit or the redemption date, as the case may be, shall be limited to receiving, subject to the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement, their proportionate part of the total redemption price (less any tax required to be deducted or withheld therefrom, including, without limitation, united states dividend withholding taxes to the extent the corporation or wendy's believes that such withholding may be required) for such exchangeable shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. upon such payment or deposit of the total redemption price, the holders of the exchangeable shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the wendy's common shares delivered to them. 7.3 in paying the redemption price the corporation shall not be required to deliver fractional shares of wendy's common shares but in lieu thereof may pay to the holders of exchangeable shares or the escrow agent, as the case may be, in accordance with section 7.2 an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the canadian dollar equivalent of the current market price of one wendy's common share on the last business day prior to the retraction date. article 8 purchase for cancellation 8.1 subject to applicable law and the prior written consent of wendy's, the corporation may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the outstanding exchangeable shares at any price by agreement with a holder of record of exchangeable shares then outstanding or through the facilities of any stock exchange on which the exchangeable shares are listed or quoted at any price per share together with an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends thereon (less any tax required to be deducted or withheld therefrom by the corporation, including, without limitation, united states dividend withholding taxes to the extent the corporation or wendy's believes that such withholding may be required). article 9 dissent rights 9.1 a holder of exchangeable shares shall not be entitled to exercise any rights of dissent provided for in the act on a proposal to amend the articles of the corporation to (a) effect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of the exchangeable shares or (b) create a new class or series of shares equal or superior to the exchangeable shares. article 10 voting rights 10.1 except as required by applicable law, the holders of the exchangeable shares shall not be entitled as such to receive notice of or to attend any meeting of the shareholders of the corporations or to vote at any such meeting. 12 article 11 amendment and approval 11.1 the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the exchangeable shares may be added to, changed or removed but only with the approval of the holders of the exchangeable shares, voting separately as a class, given as hereinafter specified. 11.2 any approval given by the holders of the exchangeable shares to add to, change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition attaching to the exchangeable shares or any other matter requiring the approval or consent of the holders of exchangeable shares shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given if it shall have been given in accordance with applicable law subject to a minimum requirement that such approval be evidenced by resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at a meeting of holders of exchangeable shares duly called and held at which the holders of at least 50% of the outstanding exchangeable shares at that time are present and represented by proxy; provided that if at any such meeting the holders of at least 50% of the outstanding exchangeable shares at that time are not present or represented by proxy within one-half hour after the time appointed for such meeting then the meeting shall be adjourned to such date not less than 10 days thereafter and to such time and place as may be designated by the chairman of such meeting. at such adjourned meeting the holders of exchangeable shares present and represented by proxy thereat may transact the business for which the meeting was originally called and a resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at such meeting shall constitute the approval or consent of the holders of the exchanged shares. on every poll taken at any meeting of holders of exchangeable shares, each holder shall be entitled to one vote in respect of each exchangeable share held. subject to the foregoing, the formalities to be observed in respect of the giving or waiving of notice of any such meeting and the conduct thereof shall be those from time to time prescribed in the by-laws of the corporation with respect to meetings of shareholders. any approval or consent required to be given by the holders of exchangeable shares shall also be validly given if expressed by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by all the holders of exchangeable shares. article 12 adjustment to the specified number 12.1 if and whenever at any time up to and including the liquidation date, the outstanding wendy's common shares are subdivided or redivided into a greater number of wendy's common shares or are reduced, combined or consolidated into a smaller number of wendy's common shares (any of such events being hereinafter called a "common share reorganization"), the specified number shall be adjusted effective immediately upon the occurrence of the common share reorganization by multiplying the specified number at that time by the quotient or fraction, as the case may be, obtained when: (a) the number of wendy's common shares outstanding after the completion of such common share reorganization is divided by (b) the number of wendy's common shares outstanding before giving effect to the common share reorganization. 12.2 if and whenever at any time up to and including the liquidation date, the outstanding wendy's common shares shall be reclassified, exchanged or converted into other shares, securities or property, otherwise than as a result of a common share reorganization, or if the designation of or rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attached to the wendy's common shares are changed, or if there shall be an amalgamation, merger, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or other similar transaction affecting wendy's (other than a transaction which does not result in any reclassification of the outstanding wendy's common shares or a change of the wendy's common shares into other assets, securities or property), or a 13 transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of wendy's to another corporation or entity (any such event being referred to in this section 12.2 as a "reclassification"), then each such holder of exchangeable shares shall be entitled to receive and shall accept and the corporation shall deliver to each such holder (or to the escrow agent in the case of exchangeable shares then being held in escrow pursuant to the escrow agreement) at the time such holder would otherwise have received wendy's common shares, in lieu of the number of wendy's common shares such holder would have received at such time if there had been no reclassification, the aggregate number and kind of shares or other securities or amount of other property which such holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of the reclassification if, on the effective date thereof, he had been the registered holder of the number of wendy's common shares to which he was theretofore entitled at such time. 12.3 if wendy's shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all the holders of the outstanding wendy's common shares entitling such holders for a period expiring not more than forty-five (45) days after such record date, to subscribe for or purchase additional wendy's common shares (or securities convertible into wendy's common shares), the specified number shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the specified number in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the denominator shall be the total number of wendy's common shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of wendy's common shares equal to the number arrived at by dividing the aggregate price of the total number of additional wendy's common shares offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered) by the current market price per share of wendy's common shares on such record date and of which the numerator shall be the total number of wendy's common shares outstanding on such record date plus the total number of additional wendy's common shares offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible); provided, however, that any wendy's common shares owned by or held for the account of wendy's shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. if such rights, options or warrants are not so issued or to the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the specified number shall be readjusted to the specified number which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed, or to the specified number which would then be in effect based upon the number of wendy's common shares (or securities convertible into wendy's common shares) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, as the case may be. 12.4 if wendy's shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all or substantially all the holders of outstanding wendy's common shares of (i) shares of any class other than wendy's common shares, or (ii) rights, options or warrants (excluding those referred to in section 12.3), or (iii) evidences of its indebtedness, then in each such case the specified number shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the specified number in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the denominator shall be the total number of wendy's common shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the current market price per share of wendy's common shares on such record date less the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive) of such shares or rights, options or warrants or evidences of indebtedness or assets so to be distributed, and of which the numerator shall be the total number of wendy's common shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by such current market price per share of wendy's common shares, provided, however, wendy's common shares owned by or held for the account of wendy's shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. to the extent that such distribution is not so made, the specified number shall be readjusted to the specified number which would then be in effect based upon such shares or rights, options or warrants or evidences of indebtedness or assets actually distributed. 14 12.5 if and whenever at any time up to and including the liquidation date, wendy's shall take any action affecting or relating to wendy's common shares, other than an event described in section 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 or 12.4, which in the opinion of the board of directors would prejudicially affect the rights of the holders of exchangeable shares, then the specified number shall be adjusted in such manner, if any, and at such time, as the board of directors may determine in their sole discretion to be equitable in the circumstances to the holders of exchangeable shares. any such determination shall be binding upon the corporation, wendy's and each holder of exchangeable shares. the failure by the board of directors to take any action to provide for an adjustment on or prior to the effective date of any action by wendy's affecting the wendy's common shares shall be conclusive evidence that the board of directors has determined that it is equitable to make no adjustment in the circumstances. 12.6 if a dispute shall at any time arise with respect to the adjustments provided for herein, such dispute shall be conclusively determined by the board of directors acting in good faith and any such determination shall be binding upon the corporation, wendy's and all holders of exchangeable shares. 12.7 no adjustment in the specified number shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one per cent in such rate; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this section 12.7 are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. the

"registrable securities": any wendy's common shares (or any shares of capital stock issued in exchange therefor or reclassification thereof) issued to shareholder pursuant to the ancillary agreements, except that particular registrable securities shall cease to be registrable securities if and at such time as 2 (i) a registration statement with respect to the sale of such securities shall have been declared effective under the 1933 act and such securities shall have been disposed of in accordance with such registration statement or (ii) such securities shall have been sold or otherwise transferred in a privately negotiated transaction, pursuant to rule 144 under the 1933 act, or otherwise, to a party other than ronald v. joyce or his legal representatives. 1.2. "sec": the u.s. securities and exchange commission, or any successor thereto. 1.3. "share exchange agreement": the share exchange agreement, dated as of the date hereof, among wendy's, newco and shareholder. 1.4. "1933 act": the u.s. securities act of 1933, as amended. 2. demand registrations. 2.1. at any time, and from time to time, after wendy's shall have filed with the sec financial statements including at least 30 days of combined operating results of wendy's and newco, upon written request of shareholder or his legal representatives, wendy's shall use its best efforts to file with the sec as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 90 days after receiving such request) a registration statement under the 1933 act covering the registrable securities included in such request, and wendy's shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as expeditiously as practicable; provided, however, that if wendy's, in its sole good faith judgment, determines that filing or maintaining the effectiveness of a registration statement covering registrable securities (or any disclosure which may be reasonably required to be contained therein) is reasonably likely to materially interfere with any financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization, merger or other transaction, or require premature disclosure of any material circumstance, relating to wendy's, wendy's may postpone such filing or terminate the effectiveness thereof for a period not to exceed 135 days. wendy's shall not be obligated (i) to file more than eight registration statements pursuant to this section 2, (ii) to file more than one registration statement (including any registration statement filed by wendy's other than pursuant to this section 2) during any consecutive 180-day period, or (iii) to file a registration statement covering registrable securities in an amount representing less than 7.5% of the total number of wendy's common shares which are exchangeable for the total number of newco exchangeable shares purchased by shareholder under the purchase agreement (as adjusted to give effect to any subsequent changes in the wendy's common shares). - 2 - 3 2.2. any request by shareholder or his legal representatives pursuant to this section 2 shall (1) express shareholder's present intent to offer a specified number of registrable securities for distribution; (2) describe in reasonable detail the nature or method of the proposed offer and sale thereof; and (3) contain an undertaking to furnish all such information and materials and take all such action as may be required in order to permit wendy's to comply with all applicable requirements of the sec, to obtain acceleration of the effective date of the registration statement and to comply with all reasonable requests of the underwriters, if any. 2.3. shareholder agrees that, prior to any sale of its registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement, he will have exchanged newco exchangeable shares for wendy's common shares in an amount necessary to effect such sale. 2.4. if an offering pursuant to this section 2 shall be effected through underwriters, the managing underwriters therefor shall be jointly selected by wendy's and shareholder. such underwriters shall agree to be bound by the provisions of section 5.6(b) of the share exchange agreement. 2.5. wendy's shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this section 2 if at the time wendy's receives shareholder's request to effect a registration, wendy's is not eligible to use form s-3 or any successor form thereto. 3. expenses. wendy's shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by wendy's in connection with any registration of registrable securities pursuant to section 2, including, without limitation, all sec and blue sky registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of legal counsel and accountants for wendy's and transfer agents' and registrar's fees, fees and disbursements of experts used by wendy's in connection with such registration, and expenses incidental to any post-effective amendment to any such registration statement; provided, however, wendy's shall not be required to bear, and shareholder hereby agrees to bear, such costs and expenses attributed to the registration which consist of underwriters' commissions, brokerage fees, or transfer taxes, or fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants of the parties (other than wendy's) whose shares are covered by the registration statement. notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this section 3 shall be deemed automatically amended to the extent necessary to cause these expense provisions to comply with the "blue sky" or similar securities laws of each jurisdiction in which an offering of registrable securities is made. - 3 - 4 4. requirements with respect to registration. if and whenever wendy's is required by the provisions hereof to register registrable shares, wendy's will, as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement and such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the 1933 act with respect to the disposition of all registrable securities covered by such registration statement for the period required to effect the distribution of such shares, but in no event shall wendy's be required to do so for a period of more than 120 days following the effective date of such registration statement. (b) furnish at its expense to shareholder such number of copies of a preliminary, final, supplemental or amended prospectus, or other prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 act as shareholder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of its registrable securities, but only while wendy's is required, under the provisions hereof, to cause the registration statement to remain current. (c) use its best efforts to register or qualify the registrable securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the u.s. as shareholder shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and things which may be necessary or advisable to enable shareholder to consummate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by him in such jurisdiction; provided, however, that wendy's shall in no event be required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified, to conform the composition of its assets at the time to the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdiction, to execute or file any general consent to service of process under the laws of any jurisdiction, to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits other than those arising out of the offer and sale of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement or to subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it has not theretofore done so. (d) as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective date of any such registration statement, and in any event, within 16 months thereafter, make generally available to its shareholders an earnings statement (which need not be audited) complying with section 11(a) of the 1933 act and covering a period of at least twelve consecutive months beginning after the effective date of any such registration statement. - 4 - 5 (e) deliver promptly to shareholder copies of all correspondence between the sec and wendy's, its counsel or auditors, and permit shareholder to do such reasonable investigation upon reasonable advance notice with respect to information contained in the registration statement as it deems reasonably necessary and to supply such additional information concerning wendy's or the registration statement as shall be reasonably necessary to enable it to fulfill its responsibilities under the 1933 act. (f) obtain a "comfort letter" from wendy's independent public accountants, in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "comfort letters" as shareholder shall reasonably request. (g) deliver an opinion of counsel (who may be an employee of wendy's) for wendy's, addressed to shareholder, and any underwriter, in the form usual and customary in connection with secondary public offerings of securities. (h) enter into such customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement containing such representations and warranties by wendy's and such other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements for comparable offerings) as the seller or the underwriters participating in such offering may reasonably request. (i) use its best efforts to list all the registrable securities covered by the registration statement on the same securities exchange or inter dealer quotation systems as the voting common equity securities of wendy's are then listed or quoted, and to pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith. (j) furnish unlegended certificates representing ownership of the registrable securities being sold in such denominations as shall be requested by the holders thereof, or the underwriters in the case of an underwritten offering, in connection with any sale pursuant to a registration statement. 5. indemnification by wendy's. in the event of any registration of registrable securities under the 1933 act pursuant to section 2 above, wendy's shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by law shareholder, any other person whose shares are included in such registration statement (for the purposes of this section, shareholder and such persons shall be referred to individually as a "seller" and collectively as "sellers"), any underwriter and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 act, against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, joint or several, to which each such seller or underwriter - 5 - 6 or controlling person may become subject, under the 1933 act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such registration statement or preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of such registration statement) or final or summary prospectus contained therein (if used during the period wendy's is required to keep the registration statement effective), or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each such seller, underwriter and controlling person for any legal or any other out of pocket expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim, excluding any amounts paid in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of wendy's; provided, however, that wendy's will not be liable to a particular seller or underwriter in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in said registration statement, said preliminary prospectus or said final or summary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to wendy's by seller or its affiliates, or by that underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for use in the preparation thereof. in addition, wendy's will not be liable for legal expenses of more than one law firm representing seller, any underwriters and controlling persons and will not indemnify any underwriter or any person who controls such underwriter if such underwriter failed to send or to give a copy of the final prospectus to the person asserting the claim at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such shares to such person and if the untrue statement or omission concerned had been corrected in such final prospectus and if wendy's advises the underwriter in writing of such correction at or before the time such final prospectus becomes available. 6. indemnification by shareholder. in the event of any registration of shares under the 1933 act pursuant to section 2 above, shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by law wendy's, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed such registration statement and each other person, if any, who controls wendy's within the meaning of the 1933 act, against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, joint or several, to which wendy's or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the 1933 act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such registration statement, or preliminary prospectus or final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise - 6 - 7 out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse wendy's, such directors, officers and controlling persons for all legal or other out of pocket expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim, excluding any amounts paid in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of shareholder; but in all such cases only if, and to the extent that, any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission therein made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to wendy's by shareholder or its affiliates specifically for use in the preparation thereof. in no event shall the liability of shareholder under this section 6 be greater in amount than the u.s. dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any underwriting discount) received by shareholder and its affiliates upon the sale of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement; provided, however, that if, at the time a claim is made against shareholder under this section 6, all of the registrable securities included in the registration statement have not been sold, then the limit on shareholder's liability set forth herein shall be increased by the u.s. dollar amount shareholder and its affiliates would have received for such unsold registrable securities had they been sold on the day the registration statement was first declared effective, calculated, in the case of an underwritten offering, using the amount (net of underwriting discounts) shareholder and its affiliates would have received from the underwriter and in the case of an offering that is not underwritten, using the price that wendy's common shares last traded on such date. 7. actions commenced. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under sections 5 or 6 above of notice of the commencement of any action involving any claim, loss, damage or liability referred to in such sections, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under any of such sections, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action. the failure of an indemnified party to provide such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnity obligations, except to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party that it so chooses, such indemnifying party shall not be liable for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that if either (i) the indemnifying party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to diligently defend such claim within 30 days after receiving notice from the indemnified party that the indemnified party believes - 7 - 8 it has failed to do so, or (ii) if such indemnified party who is a defendant in any action or proceeding which is also brought against the indemnifying party reasonably shall have concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party which are not available to the indemnifying party, then in either such case the indemnified party may assume its own defense and the indemnifying party shall be liable for any expenses therefor (but not of more than one counsel). no indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment or settle any claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party. 8. contribution. 8.1. if for any reason the indemnity set forth in sections 5 or 6 above is unavailable or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party thereunder, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from such offering of securities. if, however, the allocation provided in the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this section 8.1 were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the preceding sentences of this section 8.1. the amount paid or payable shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the 1933 act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8.2. the indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain operative and in full force - 8 - 9 and effect regardless of any investigation made or omitted by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 9. miscellaneous. 9.1. amendments, modifications, etc. this agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties hereto in any manner, except by an instrument in writing signed by duly authorized officers or representatives of wendy's and shareholder. 9.2. no waiver. the failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any way to effect the validity of this agreement or any party hereof or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. no waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance. 9.3. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of ohio, without regard to its conflict of law rules. 9.4. notices. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered in person or sent by facsimile or via a reputable international overnight courier service to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice), and shall be deemed given on the date on which delivered by hand or otherwise on the date of receipt: if to wendy's: wendy's international, inc. p.o. box 256 4288 west dublin-granville road dublin, ohio 43017 attention: lawrence e. schauf, esq. facsimile no.: (614) 764-3243 -
