other party if such other party is in breach of any material representation, warranty, or covenant contained in the merger agreement, (c) by either royal grip or fmp if the merger fails to receive the

nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated business, financial condition or results of operations of rg and its subsidiaries (an "rg material adverse effect"). each rg subsidiary is a corporation duly organized,

adverse effect; (c) will not violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to rg or the rg subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets, except for

a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. the 1996 and 1995 consolidated financial statements of rg included in or incorporated by reference into the rg reports (including the related notes and schedules) present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of rg at december 31, 1996 and 1995, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended of rg in conformity with gaap

of rg, overtly threatened against rg or the rg subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets, at law or in equity, or before or by any federal or state commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an rg material adverse effect, or would prevent or delay the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this agreement. neither rg nor any of the rg subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree which, insofar as can be reasonably foreseen, individually or in the aggregate, in the future would have an rg material adverse effect or would prevent or delay the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby. 4.9. absence of certain changes. since the rg
