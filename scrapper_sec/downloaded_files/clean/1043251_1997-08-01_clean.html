("nhtc"), gha and the stockholders of gha (including cd and alp). capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms under the nhtc agreement. under the nhtc agreement, nhtc has issued or delivered, or may be obligated to issue and deliver, shares of its common stock, par value $.001 per share, as follows: (i) 5,800,000 shares issuable at the one or more closings (the "firm shares"); (ii) 800,000 shares contingently issuable promptly after the 60th day after the end of the first contingent shares measure period (the "first contingent shares"); and (iii) a presently-undeterminable number of shares (up to $45,000,000 worth) contingently issuable promptly after the 60th day after the end of the second contingent shares measure period (the "second contingent shares"). under the nhtc agreement, each stockholder of gha immediately prior to the initial closing ("gha stockholders") thereunder is entitled to receive a proportion of the firm shares and any first contingent shares and second contingent shares that are issued (collectively, the "nhtc shares") equal to such stockholder's "percentage". for this purpose, percentage means, with respect to any gha stockholder, the percentage obtained by dividing: (i) the number of shares of common stock of gha held by such cusip no. 63888p-10-9 exhibit c page 71 of 91 pages - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gha stockholder (as indicated opposite such gha stockholder's name on theappropriate "agreement signature page" to the nhtc agreement), by (ii) the total number of such shares outstanding on the closing date; provided that a gha stockholder's percentage may be adjusted to the extent that such gha stockholder has acquired or transferred its rights to any of the nhtc shares from or to any other gha stockholder. the purpose of this letter is to set forth our agreement with respect to our respective nhtc shares, as follows. 1. ownership of contingent shares. it is hereby agreed that, as between the undersigned cd and alp (and notwithstanding any inconsistent issuance or delivery of nhtc shares by nhtc), cd shall own (or otherwise be entitled to all the benefits of ownership of) 60%, and alp shall own (or otherwise be entitled to all the benefits of ownership of) 40%, of all of the first contingent shares and second contingent shares (collectively, the "contingent shares") that may be issued or delivered to cd and alp; provided, however, that, in the event that sir brian wolfson shall not have remained an officer or director of nhtc substantially continuously from the date hereof until the end of the second contingent shares measure period, then cd shall own (or otherwise be entitled to all the benefits of ownership of) 50%, and alp shall own (or otherwise be entitled to all the benefits of ownership of) 50%, of all of the contingent shares that may be issued or delivered to cd and alp. the nhtc shares that, as a result of the foregoing agreement, cd shall own (or be entitled to the benefits of ownership of) in excess of the approximately 33%/67% cd/alp gha shares proportion are hereinafter referred to as the "excess shares". 2. transfer;
