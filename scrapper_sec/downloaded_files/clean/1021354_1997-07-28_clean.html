dated as of may 20, 1997, by and between paul g. allen and hsni (the "stock exchange agreement"), hsni acquired 12,283,014 shares (the "shares") of ticketmaster common stock in exchange for the issuance to mr. allen of 7,238,507 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of hsni ("hsni com- mon stock"), subject to the issuance of up to an additional 3,257,328 shares of hsni common stock to be reserved for con- tingent issuance in july 1998 if the average market price of hsni common stock over a specified period prior to such date is below $29 per share. a copy of the stock exchange agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 1 and is incorporated herein by ref- erence, and the description herein of the stock exchange agree- ment is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. on july 24, and 25, 1997, hsni acquired, in open market purchases, 70,000 and 42,000 shares, respectively, of ticketmaster common stock for $16 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $1,792,000 (excluding commissions). hsni's working capital was used to make such purchases. item 4. purpose of transaction. the stock exchange agreement was entered into, and the shares were purchased, in order that hsni could acquire and hold a significant ownership stake in ticketmaster for invest- ment purposes while exploring all alternatives relative to ticketmaster available to hsni. those alternatives may in- clude, without limitation, acquiring additional shares of tick- etmaster common stock in the open market or otherwise (which may include by merger) and/or pursuing strategic opportunities between hsni and ticketmaster relating to fulfillment and other arrangements. while hsni has not reached any definite conclusions concerning its future course of action with respect to ticketmaster and the ticketmaster common stock beneficially owned by it and will continue to consider all of its options, hsni is considering the possibility of proposing a merger. however, there can be no assurance that any such merger proposal will be made or, even if made, as to what the terms or timing of such proposal would be. in reaching any conclusion as to its future course of action hsni will take into consideration various factors, including, but not limited to, ticketmaster's business and prospects, other developments concerning ticketmaster, other business opportunities available to hsni, developments with respect to the businesses of hsni, general economic conditions and money and stock market condi- tions, including, but not limited to, the market price of the ticketmaster common stock. under the stock exchange agreement, mr. allen was re- quired to use all reasonable efforts to cause ticketmaster to take such action so that, effective upon the closing under the stock exchange agreement, the board of directors of ticketmas- ter would consist of up to a majority of persons designated by hsni (the precise number of which was to be determined by -4- hsni). under this provision, barry diller, chairman and chief executive officer of hsni, and james held, president and chief executive officer of home shopping network, inc. and vice chairman of hsni, joined the ticketmaster board of directors as of the closing under the stock exchange agreement. hsni reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to: (i) acquire additional shares of ticketmaster common stock, in open market or privately negotiated transactions, through merger, or otherwise; (ii) dispose of all or a portion of its holdings of ticketmaster common stock; (iii) continue to hold all or a part of such shares and exercise voting control over ticketmaster, or to hold such shares as a passive invest- ment; (iv) take other actions which could involve one or more of the types of transactions or have one or more of the results described in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d; or (v) change its intention with respect to any or all of the matters referred to in this item 4. except as set forth in this item 4, hsni presently has no plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. on july 17, 1997, the company consummated the transac- tions contemplated by the stock exchange agreement and acquired from paul g. allen 12,283,014 shares of ticketmaster common stock, of which hsni holds sole voting and dispositive power. an additional 112,000 shares of ticketmaster common stock were acquired in open market purchases from july 24 to july 25, 1997. based upon 24,739,715 shares of ticketmaster common stock out- standing as of may 20, 1997, the shares of ticketmaster common stock held by hsni represent approximately 50.1% of the total number of shares of ticketmaster common stock outstanding. bruce ramer, a director of hsni, owns 2,500 shares of ticketmaster common stock for which he holds sole voting and dispositive power. hsni disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares owned by mr. ramer. william savoy, as a director of ticketmaster received on june 10, 1997 a grant of options to acquire 10,000 shares of ticketmaster common stock (exercisable at $13.875 per share beginning on december 10, 1997). hsni disclaims beneficial ownership of the options and underlying shares owned by mr. savoy. except as set forth in item 3 and this item 5, no transactions involving ticketmaster common stock have been effected during the past 60 days by hsni or, to the best knowledge of hsni, by its directors, executive officers or control persons. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understanding or relation- ships with respect to securities of the issuer. the information set forth under items 3 and 4 of this schedule 13d is incorporated herein by reference. hsni has entered into a letter agreement with fredric d. rosen (the "letter agreement") in connection with the stock exchange agreement, under which hsni will extend the period -5- during which mr. rosen may exercise his "tag-along rights" in respect of the 306,208 shares of ticketmaster common stock cov- ered by the shareholders agreement, dated as of december 15, 1993, by and among mr. allen, mr. rosen and certain other par- ties (the "shareholders agreement"). mr. rosen may exercise, and hsni will honor, mr. rosen's tag-along rights under the shareholders agreement, provided that mr. rosen notify hsni of his decision to exercise his tag-along rights no later than january 6, 1998. a copy of the letter agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 2 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the de- scription herein of the letter agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. item 7. material to be

notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the company fails to comply with the covenants contained herein despite the stockholder's efforts, for purposes of hsni's rights under this agreement, such failure shall be a breach of the applicable covenant, permitting, to the full extent of hsni's rights under this agreement, hsni to terminate this agreement, and there shall be no liability on the part of the -36- stockholder for the company's failure (provided the stockholder acts in good faith). section 13.06. applicable law. this agreement shall -------------- be governed by, construed and

event that any of the covenants contained in this agreement were not performed in all material respects by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or conditions or were otherwise breached, and that money damages are an inadequate remedy for breach thereof because of the difficulty of ascertaining and quantifying the amount of damage that will be suffered by the parties hereto in the event that such covenants are not performed in accordance with their terms or are otherwise breached. it is accordingly hereby agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to restrain, enjoin and prevent breaches and violations of any of the covenants contained in this agreement by the other parties and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the united states or any state having competent jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition to and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies to which the other parties are entitled to at law or in equity. section 13.09. no waiver. the failure of any party at any --------- time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall not affect the right at a later

otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of any other provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty of this agreement. -37- section 13.10. counterparts. this agreement may be executed ------------ in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
