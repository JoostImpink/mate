whereas, pursuant to the merger, each outstanding share (a "share") of the company's common stock (the "company common stock"), shall be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration (as defined in section 1.6(a)), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and whereas, as an inducement to parent to acquire the company, and as a condition to parent's willingness to enter into this agreement, parent, merger sub and the herbert h. freedland trust (the "shareholder") are entering into a shareholder agreement (the "shareholder agreement") pursuant to which the shareholder has agreed to (i) grant parent and merger sub an irrevocable option to buy its shares at $37.00 per share, and (ii) in the event that such irrevocable option is not theretofore exercised, to vote its shares in favor of the merger, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein;

(b) by-laws. unless otherwise determined by parent prior to the effective time, the by-laws of the company, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, shall be the by-laws of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the mbca, the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation and such by-laws. section 1.5 directors and officers. the board of directors of merger sub immediately prior to the effective time shall be the initial board of directors of the surviving corporation, each member to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the surviving corporation, and the officers of merger sub immediately prior to the effective time shall be the initial officers of the surviving corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. section 1.6 effect on capital stock. at the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the parent, merger sub, the company or the holders of any of the following securities: (a) conversion of securities. each share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding any shares to be canceled pursuant to section 1.6(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive $37.00, in cash, without interest (the "merger consideration"). (b) cancellation. each share owned by parent, merger sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company or parent immediately prior to the effective time shall, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and cease to exist. (c) stock options. at or immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding employee and director stock option to purchase shares (an "option") granted under the howell industries, inc. 1995 stock incentive plan for key employees (such plans or arrangements, the "company stock option plan"), shall be canceled, and each holder of any such option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be paid by the company, at or immediately prior to the effective time for each such option, in consideration therefor an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of $37.00 per share over the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of shares such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all options) had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the effective time. the company shall use all reasonable efforts to effectuate the foregoing, including without limitation, amending the option plans and obtaining any necessary consents from option holders; provided, however, that prior to the effective time, the board of directors of the company shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to adjust and which action, if any, shall be acceptable in all reasonable respects to the parent, effective immediately prior to the effective time, the terms of each outstanding option as to which any such consent is not obtained prior to the effective time to provide that such option shall be converted into the right, upon exercise of such option at any time after the effective time, to receive an amount in cash equal to $37.00 for each share subject to such option, or, alternatively, upon the surrender and cancellation of such option at any time after the effective time to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of $37.00 per share over the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of shares subject to such option, in either case without interest or any other adjustment thereto. (d) capital stock of merger sub. each share of common stock, without par value, of merger sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the surviving corporation. section 1.7 exchange of certificates. (a) exchange agent. parent shall designate nbd bank, comerica bank, michigan national bank, or other bank or trust company satisfactory to the company, to act as agent for holders of company common stock (the "exchange agent"), to receive funds to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to section 1.6(a). parent shall deposit immediately prior to or at the effective time such funds with the exchange agent. such funds shall be invested by the exchange agent as directed by parent or the surviving corporation in trust for the benefit of the holders of company common stock, for payment in accordance with this section 1.7 in exchange for outstanding shares. (b) exchange procedures. as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, parent will instruct the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of certificates (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as parent and the company may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the certificates in exchange for payment of the merger consideration. upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration, and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. in the event of a transfer of ownership of shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the company as of the effective time, the merger consideration may be paid in accordance with this article i to a transferee if the share is presented to the exchange agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this section 1.7(b) and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. until surrendered as contemplated by this section 1.7(b) such certificates shall represent solely the right to receive the merger consolidation with respect to each of the shares represented thereby. (c) transfers of ownership. if any merger consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to the payment thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the merger consideration to any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or have established to the satisfaction of parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable. (d) termination of fund; no liability. at any time following six months after the effective time, the surviving corporation shall be entitled to require the exchange agent to deliver to it any funds (including interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the exchange agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the surviving corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the merger consideration payable upon the surrender of their certificates, without any interest thereon. notwithstanding the foregoing, neither parent, merger sub nor the company shall be liable to any holder of company common stock for any merger consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (e) withholding rights. parent or the exchange agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of company common stock such amounts as parent or the exchange agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. to the extent that amounts are so withheld by parent or the exchange agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement

the stock transfer books of the company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of company common stock thereafter on the records of the company. section 1.9 no

immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, shares are presented to the surviving corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this article i. section 1.10 lost, stolen or destroyed certificates. in the event any certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the exchange agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the merger consideration as provided in this article; provided, however, that parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against parent or the exchange agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. section 1.11 taking of necessary action; further action. each of parent, merger sub and the company will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the merger in accordance with this agreement as promptly as practicable. if, at any time after the effective time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this agreement and to vest the surviving corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the company and merger sub, the officers and directors of the company and merger sub immediately prior to the effective time are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action. section 1.12
