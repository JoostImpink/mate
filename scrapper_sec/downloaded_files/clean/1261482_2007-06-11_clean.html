(b) an extraordinary corporate transaction involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (f) any other material change in the issuer&#146;s business or corporate structure, including but not limited to, if the issuer is a registered closed-end investment company, any plans or proposals to make any changes in its investment policy for which a vote is required by section 13 of the investment company act of 1940; (g) changes in the issuer&#146;s charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person; (h) causing a class of securities of the issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) a class of equity securities of the issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the act; or (j) any action similar to any of those actions enumerated above. notwithstanding the foregoing, at the date of this statement, the reporting persons do have plans or proposals which would result in: (a) the acquisition of additional securities of the issuer. pursuant to the purchase agreement, prior to the maturity date of the senior secured note, the issuer will seek stockholder approval for the issuance and sale to perseus vii of: (i) a senior secured convertible promissory note with an aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000 (the &#147;senior secured convertible note&#148;) and (ii) a warrant to purchase shares of common stock (the &#147;subsequent warrant&#148; and together with the initial warrant, the &#147;warrants&#148;). assuming such stockholder approval is obtained and other conditions set forth in the purchase agreement are satisfied or waived, the issuer will issue and sell to perseus vii the senior secured convertible note, the proceeds of which will be used in part to repay in full the senior secured notes. the senior secured convertible note will be convertible at perseus vii&#146;s election into shares of common stock at a price per share equal to the lower of $1.20 and 75% of the volume weighted average price of the common stock on the nasdaq global market for the ten trading day period ending on the day prior to the date of the closing of the sale of the senior secured convertible note. the senior secured convertible note will bear interest at a rate of 12.5% per annum and will, in the issuer&#146;s discretion, be paid either in cash or in kind by the issuance of additional senior secured convertible promissory notes (the &#147;additional convertible notes&#148; and together with the senior secured convertible note, the &#147;convertible notes&#148;). the additional convertible notes would also be convertible into shares of common stock on the same terms as described above for the senior secured convertible note. simultaneously with the issuance of the senior secured convertible note, the issuer will issue to perseus vii the subsequent warrant. the subsequent warrant will allow perseus vii to purchase a maximum of (i) 1,989,629 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.80 per share and (ii) 33,000,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $1.00 to $3.00 per share. (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction. the issuer has undertaken in the purchase agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the business of its wholly owned subsidiary, proton energy systems, inc (&#147;proton&#148;). the purchase agreement requires the issuer to engage an investment bank to assist in soliciting offers to purchase this business by june 21, 2007. (c) the sale of a material amount of assets of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries. as noted directly above, the issuer has undertaken to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the business of its wholly owned subsidiary, proton. such a transaction may constitute the sale of a material amount of assets of the issuer and its subsidiary. (d) a change in the present board of directors of the issuer. a precondition to the purchase of the senior secured convertible note by perseus vii is that the issuer shall have reduced the size of its board to five members. upon the issuance of the senior secured convertible note, perseus vii will be entitled to representation on the issuer&#146;s board equal to at least its percentage ownership of the issuer assuming exercise of the warrants and conversion of the convertible notes. based upon the issuer&#146;s current capitalization, we believe that perseus vii could have the right to name three of five directors. (g) impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person. under the terms of the purchase agreement, perseus vii has a right of first refusal with respect to (i) all subsequent transactions to finance wind projects and (ii) all other financings until the issuer has, in the aggregate, raised $20,000,000 in net investment proceeds, including financings through the issuance of any equity security or any security convertible into or exercisable for any equity security of the issuer. by exercising its right of first refusal, perseus vii could impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by other persons. additionally, the senior secured notes provide that perseus vii&#146;s prior written consent is required for the issuer to enter into any transaction, or a series of related transactions, which would result in, a change of control. &#147;change of control&#148; is defined to include, among other things: (i) any merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other business combination involving the issuer or any of its material subsidiaries, in which the shareholders of the issuer immediately prior thereto do not own, directly or indirectly, outstanding voting power of the surviving entity or (ii) the sale of voting securities of the issuer in a transaction or series of related transactions that results in the purchaser owning more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer or any of its material subsidiaries. perseus vii also has plans or proposals that would result in changes in the issuer&#146;s charter. in connection with the issuance of the senior secured convertible note and the subsequent warrant, it will be necessary for the issuer to amend its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of common shares authorized for issuance. the issuer will seek stockholder approval of such amendment. item 5. interest in securities of issuer. (a) each of the reporting persons may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 7,954,536 shares of common stock. this number represents the maximum number of shares of common stock that the reporting persons could beneficially own, assuming full exercise of the initial warrant. based on calculations made in accordance with rule 13d-3, this number represents approximately 16.66% of the issuer&#146;s common stock (based on the 39,792,574 shares outstanding on may 31, 2007 plus the 7,954,536 shares of common stock reported in this statement ). (b) perseus vii will have sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the 7,954,536 shares of common stock beneficially owned by perseus vii. by virtue of the relationships between and among the reporting persons described in item 2 of this statement, mr. pearl may be deemed to have the power to direct the voting and disposition of the 7,954,536 shares of common stock beneficially owned by perseus vii.

(d) limitations . the company shall not be obligated to (i) effect more than two registrations under section 2(b) in any twelve month period, (ii) effect any registration where the aggregate estimated sales price for the registrable securities to be included therein is less than $500,000, or (iii) effect more than two registrations on form s-1 or any other long-form registration statement; provided , that a registration pursuant to this section 2 shall not be counted unless the registration statement pursuant to which such registrable securities are being registered is declared effective by the securities and exchange commission (the &#147; commission &#148;). 3. piggy-back registration .
