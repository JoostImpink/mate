purchaser price per share equal to the average market price per share on the date of the company's notice given pursuant to this section 5, that number of shares of common stock which, if purchased by the purchaser, would result in the purchaser's retaining the percentage interest in the total voting power of the company in effect prior to such reduction of its interest, up to a percentage interest of twenty-five percent (25%). for purposes of this agreement, the average 9 4 page 10 of 11 market price of any security at any date shall be the average of the closing prices for a share of such security on the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the trading date last preceding the date of determination of such price, as reported on the nasdaq national market system ("nms") or, if such

sale of shares of common stock under this section 5. the issuance of such shares shall be subject to compliance with applicable stock exchange or nasdaq requirements and there shall not then be in effect any order enjoining or restraining such exercise on issuance. notwithstanding the foregoing, if any issuance of securities or rights to acquire securities requiring the company to make an offer under this section 5 shall be for a number of securities representing less than 3% of the total voting power of this company in effect immediately following such issuance, the company shall have the right to delay giving the notice otherwise required by this section 5 until the earlier of (i) the next issuance which, together with all issuances after which notice was delayed pursuant to this sentence, shall represent an aggregate of 3% or more of the total voting power of the company then in effect or (ii) the 45th calendar day next preceding the last day of the company's then fiscal year

the total voting power of the company held by adlt declining below twenty-two percent (22%). as used in this agreement, the term "total voting power of the company" means the total number of votes which may be cast in the election of directors of the company at any meeting of shareholders of the company if all securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the company were present
