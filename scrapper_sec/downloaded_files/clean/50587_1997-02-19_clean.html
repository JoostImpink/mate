at least a majority of all outstanding shares (for purposes of this clause (x) only, "shares" shall be deemed to refer only to shares outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement) and (y) that number of shares which, together with the shares subject to the stockholder agreement that shall not have been so tendered, would represent at least a majority of the fully diluted shares as of the date of determination (determined on a fully diluted basis for all outstanding stock options and any other rights to acquire shares) (the conditions in (x) and (y) collectively, the "minimum condition"). the minimum number of shares that would satisfy the minimum condition shall be referred to as the "minimum number of shares." acquisition has reserved the right (subject to obtaining the express written consent of the issuer and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission), to waive or reduce the minimum condition and to elect to purchase, pursuant to the offer, less than the minimum number of shares. the offer has been made pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of february 10, 1997 (the "merger agreement"), among j&j, acquisition and the issuer pursuant to which, following the consummation of the offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, acquisition will be merged with and into the issuer, with the issuer surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of j&j (the "merger"). in the merger, each outstanding share not tendered in the offer (other than shares owned by the issuer as treasury stock or by j&j, acquisition or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of j&j or by stockholders, if any, who are entitled to and who properly exercise dissenters' rights under delaware law) will be page 19 of 51 pages schedule 13d ------------ issuer: innotech, inc. cusip number: 45766m 10 0 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- converted into the right to receive the per share price paid in the offer in cash, without interest. the merger is subject to a number of other conditions, including approval by stockholders of the issuer, if such approval is required by applicable law. in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum have entered into a stockholder agreement dated as of february 10, 1997 (the "stockholder agreement"), with acquisition and j&j, pursuant to which cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum have agreed to sell to acquisition, and acquisition has agreed to purchase, all 3,331,608 shares beneficially owned by them, as well as any shares subsequently acquired by cvca, cibcwg or dr. blum through the exercise of options or otherwise, at a price per share equal to $13.75, provided that such obligation to sell and such obligation to purchase are subject to acquisition having accepted shares for payment under the offer and the minimum condition having been satisfied. pursuant to the terms of the stockholder agreement, acquisition has the right to require cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum to tender the shares subject to the stockholder agreement into the offer. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum each has also executed and delivered a proxy for the benefit of acquisition with respect to the shares subject to the stockholder agreement owned by such party to vote such shares against certain competing transactions. according to the offer, if the minimum condition is satisfied and acquisition accepts for payment shares tendered pursuant to the offer and acquisition purchases the shares subject to the stockholder agreement pursuant to such agreement, or cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum tender such shares pursuant to the offer, acquisition will be able to elect a majority of the members of the issuer's board of directors and to effect the merger without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder of the issuer. item 5. interest in securities of the

insofar as the requirements of this item 5 of this schedule 13d statement require that, in addition to cvca, the cibc reporting persons and dr. blum, the information called for herein should be given with respect to j&j and jjdc, the information provided in items 3 and 4 with respect to j&j and jjdc is incorporated by reference herein and should be considered fully responsive. the filing of this

issuer: innotech, inc. cusip number: 45766m 10 0 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. reference is made to the information disclosed under items 2, 3 and 4 of this schedule 13d statement which is incorporated by reference in response to this item. in addition to such information, the following contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships are reported hereunder. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, each of cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum will sell, and acquisition will purchase, all shares beneficially owned by such party, at a price per share equal to $13.75. such obligations to sell and to purchase are subject to acquisition having accepted shares for payment under the offer and the minimum condition having been satisfied. the stockholder agreement also provides that each of cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum may, and at the request of acquisition shall, tender its shares subject to the stockholder agreement in the offer. any shares of cvca, cibcwg or dr. blum not purchased in the offer will be purchased at the same time as payment is made pursuant to the offer. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, each of cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum has agreed, until the stockholder agreement has terminated, among other things, not to: (i) sell, transfer, give, pledge or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of, the shares subject to the stockholder agreement owned by such party other than pursuant to the terms of the offer or the merger, (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, in connection with, directly or indirectly, any takeover proposal (as defined in the stockholder agreement); (iii) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of, any takeover proposal; or (iv) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any takeover proposal; provided, that clause (iv) will not be deemed to have been violated if in response to an unsolicited inquiry, such party states that it or he is subject to the provisions of the stockholder agreement. the stockholder agreement, by reference to the merger agreement, defines "takeover proposal" as any proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of the issuer or 20% or more of any class of outstanding equity securities of the issuer, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the issuer or any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantially all the assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the issuer, other than the transactions contemplated by merger agreement. each of cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum has also agreed, and the stockholder agreement includes an irrevocable proxy provision for the benefit of acquisition with respect to the shares subject to the stockholders agreement owned by such party, to vote such shares (i) at any meeting of stockholders of the issuer called to vote upon the merger and the merger agreement or at any page 22 of 51 pages schedule 13d ------------ issuer: innotech, inc. cusip number: 45766m 10 0 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval (including by written consent) with respect to the merger and the merger agreement is sought, in favor of the merger, the adoption by the issuer of the merger agreement and the approval of the terms thereof and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) at any meeting of stockholders of the issuer or at any adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which such party's vote, consent or other approval is sought, such party shall vote (or cause to be voted) the shares subject to the stockholder agreement (and each class thereof) against (i) any takeover proposal or (ii) any amendment of the issuer's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other proposal or transaction involving the issuer, which amendment or other proposal or transaction would be reasonably likely to impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of each class of the common stock. the stockholder agreement provides that in the event that the merger agreement shall have been terminated under circumstances where j&j is or may become entitled to receive the termination fee (as defined in the stockholder agreement), each of cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum shall pay to acquisition on demand an amount equal to the difference between the proceeds received by such party from the consummation of any transaction which gives rise to the issuer's obligation to pay the termination fee pursuant to the merger agreement and the consideration such party would have received had it or he tendered its or his shares pursuant to the offer (without taking into account any modifications to the offer as in effect on the february 14, 1997), as determined in accordance with the stockholder agreement. the stockholder agreement, by reference to the merger agreement, defines "termination fee" as a fee equal to $6.25 million in immediately available funds payable by the issuer to j&j in the event the merger agreement is terminated by j&j or the issuer under certain circumstances. in addition, in the event that (x) prior to the effective time of the merger, a takeover proposal shall have been made and (y) the effective time of the merger shall have occurred and j&j for any reason shall have increased the amount of the per share price payable in the offer in cash, without interest, over that set forth in the merger agreement in effect on the date thereof (the "original merger consideration"), each of cvca, cibcwg and dr. blum agrees in the stockholder agreement to pay to j&j on demand an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of such party subject to the stockholder agreement and (ii) 100% of the excess, if any, of (a) the per share cash consideration or the per share fair market value of any noncash consideration, as the case may be, received by such party as a result of the merger, as amended, determined as of the effective time of the merger, over (b) the amount of the original merger consideration determined as of the time of the first increase in the amount of the original merger consideration. item 7. material to be

(each, a "stockholder" and, collectively, the "stockholders"). whereas parent, sub and the company propose to enter into an agreement and plan of merger dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended or supplemented, the "merger agreement") providing for (i) the making of a cash tender offer (as such offer may be amended from time to time as permitted under the merger agreement, the "offer") by sub for all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the company ("company common stock") and (ii) for the merger of sub with and into the company (the "merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement; and whereas each stockholder owns the number of shares of company common stock set forth opposite his or its name on schedule a attached hereto (such shares of company common stock, together with any other shares of capital stock of the company acquired by such stockholders after the date hereof and during

and whereas, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the merger agreement, parent has requested that each stockholder enter into this agreement; now, therefore, to induce parent to enter into, and in consideration of its entering into, the merger agreement, and in consideration of the premises and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows: 1. representations and warranties of each stockholder. each stockholder hereby, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to parent as of the date hereof in respect of himself or itself as follows: (a) authority. the stockholder has all requisite power and authority to enter into this agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. this agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the stockholder and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the stockholder enforceable against such stockholder in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity). except for the expiration or termination of the waiting periods under the hsr act, informational filings with the sec and the existence of the pledge agreement described in exhibit i hereto (the "pledge agreement"), the execution and delivery of this agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the terms hereof will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under any provision of, any trust agreement, loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, notice, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the stockholder or

applicable to the stockholder or any of the stockholder's properties or assets, including the subject shares. if the stockholder is a natural person and is married, and the stockholder's subject shares constitute community property or otherwise need spousal or other approval for this agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of, the stockholder's spouse, enforceable against such spouse in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity). no trust of which such stockholder is a trustee requires the consent of any beneficiary to the execution and delivery of this agreement or to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. (b) the subject shares. except with respect to shares subject to the pledge agreement, the stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of, or is trustee of a trust that is the record holder of, and whose beneficiaries are the beneficial owners of, and has good and marketable title to, the subject shares set forth opposite his or its name on schedule a attached hereto, free and clear of any claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever. the stockholder does not own, of record or beneficially, any shares of capital stock of the company other than the subject shares set forth opposite his or its name on schedule a attached hereto. the stockholder has the sole right to vote such subject shares, and none of such subject shares is subject to any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting of such subject shares, except as contemplated by this agreement. 2. purchase and sale of shares. each stockholder hereby severally agrees to sell to sub, and sub hereby agrees to purchase, all subject shares set forth opposite such stockholder's name on schedule a hereto, at a price per share equal to $13.75 per share; provided that such obligation to sell and such obligation to purchase are subject to sub having accepted shares for payment under the offer and subject to the minimum condition having been satisfied. such stockholder may tender such subject shares into the offer and sub may direct that such stockholder tender such subject shares and not withdraw any subject shares so tendered. any subject shares not purchased in the offer will be purchased at the same time as payment is made under the offer. 3. representation and warranty of parent and sub. parent and sub each hereby represents and warrants to each stockholder that each of them has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. the execution, delivery and performance of this agreement by each of parent and sub, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of parent and sub. this agreement has been duly executed and delivered by parent and sub and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of parent and sub enforceable against parent and sub in accordance with its terms. the execution and delivery of this agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under any provision of, the articles of incorporation or by-laws of parent and sub, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, lease, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation or any judgment, order, notice, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to either parent or sub or to parent or sub's property or assets. 4. covenants of each stockholder. until the termination of this agreement in accordance with section 10, each stockholder, severally and not jointly, agrees as follows: (a) at any meeting of stockholders of the company called to vote upon the merger and the merger agreement or at any adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval (including by written consent) with respect to the merger and the merger agreement is sought, the stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) the subject shares in favor of the merger, the adoption by the company of the merger agreement and the approval of the terms thereof and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. (b) at any meeting of stockholders of the company or at any adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which the stockholder's vote, consent or other approval is sought, the stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) the subject shares (and each class thereof) against (i) any takeover proposal as such term is defined in section 6.02(a) of the merger agreement or (ii) any amendment of the company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other proposal or transaction involving the company, which amendment or other proposal or transaction would be reasonably likely to impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of each class of company common stock. subject to section 12, the stockholder further agrees not to enter into any agreement inconsistent with the foregoing. (c) the stockholder shall not, prior to the earliest of (a) the effective time and (b) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, (i) sell, transfer, give, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of (including by gift) (collectively, "transfer"), consent to any transfer of, any or all of such subject shares or any interest therein or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) with respect to the transfer of, the subject shares to any person other than pursuant to the terms of the offer or the merger or (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, in connection with, directly or indirectly, any takeover proposal and agrees not to commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions. (d) subject to the terms of section 12, during the term of this agreement, the stockholder shall not, nor shall it permit any investment banker or attorney retained by, or any other adviser or representative of, such stockholder to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of, any takeover proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any takeover proposal; provided, that it is understood that this clause (ii) will not be deemed to have been violated if in response to an unsolicited inquiry, the stockholder states that it or he is subject to the provisions of this agreement. without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by an investment banker or attorney retained by, or other adviser or representative of, such stockholder, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of such stockholder, shall be deemed to be a violation of this section 4(d) by such stockholder. (e) until after the merger is consummated or the merger agreement is terminated, the stockholder shall, at the expense of parent, use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. (f) such stockholder, and any beneficiary of a revocable trust for which such stockholder serves as trustee, shall not take any action to revoke or terminate such trust or take any other action which would restrict, limit or frustrate in any way the transactions contemplated by this agreement. each such beneficiary hereby acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the terms of this agreement applicable to it. (g) (i) in the event that the merger agreement shall have been terminated under circumstances where parent is or may become entitled to receive the termination fee, each stockholder shall pay to parent on demand an amount equal to all profit determined in accordance with section 4(g)(ii) of such stockholder from the consummation of any transaction which gives rise to the company's obligation to pay the termination fee pursuant to the merger agreement. (ii) for purposes of this section 4(g), the profit of any stockholder from any takeover proposal shall equal (a) the aggregate consideration that would have been received by such stockholder pursuant to such takeover proposal if such stockholder held the same number of subject shares at the consummation of such takeover proposal as he held at the time the merger agreement was terminated (including any consideration that would have been received in respect of any unexercised stock options or warrants or similar instruments held at the time the merger agreement was terminated), valuing any noncash consideration (including any residual interest in the company) at its fair market value on the date of such consummation less (b) the fair market value of the aggregate consideration that would have been issuable or payable to such stockholder (assuming all stock options, warrants or similar instruments held by such stockholder were exercised) if he had received the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement as originally executed (without giving effect to any increase in such merger consideration). (iii) in the event that (x) prior to the effective time, a takeover proposal shall have been made and (y) the effective time of the merger shall have occurred and parent for any reason shall have increased the amount of merger consideration payable over that set forth in the merger agreement in effect on the date hereof (the "original merger consideration"), each stockholder shall pay to parent on demand an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of subject shares of such stockholder and (ii) 100% of the excess, if any, of (a) the per share cash consideration or the per share fair market value of any noncash consideration, as the case may be, received by the stockholder as a result of the merger, as amended, determined as of the effective time of the merger, over (b) the amount of the original merger consideration determined as of the time of the first increase in the amount of the original merger consideration. (iv) for purposes of this section 4(g), the fair market value of any noncash consideration consisting of: (a) securities listed on a national securities exchange or traded on the nasdaq/nms shall be equal to the average closing price per share of such security as reported on such exchange or nasdaq/nms for the twenty trading days prior to the date of determination; and (b) consideration which is other than cash or securities of the form specified in clause (a) of this section 4(g)(iv) shall be determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm mutually agreed upon by the parties within 10 business days of the event requiring selection of such banking firm; provided, however, that if the parties are unable to agree within two business days after the date of such event as to the investment banking firm, then the parties shall each select one firm, and those firms shall select a third investment banking firm, which third firm shall make such determination; provided further, that the fees and expenses of such investment banking firm shall be borne by parent. the determination of the investment banking firm shall be binding upon the parties. (v) any payment of profit under this section 4(g) shall (x) if paid in cash, be paid by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by parent and (y) if paid through a transfer of securities (with the method and timing of such transfer to be mutually agreed), be paid as soon as practicable through delivery of such securities, suitably endorsed for transfer; provided that the stockholder shall be required to pay cash under this section 4(g) only to the extent the fair market value of the securities transferred pursuant to clause (y) is less than such stockholders' profit. 5. covenant of ronald blum. ronald blum shall have his shares released from the pledge pursuant to the pledge agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof but in any event within ten business days after the date hereof. 6. grant of irrevocable proxy; appointment of proxy. (a) each stockholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints, parent and james r. utaski and james r. hilton, in their respective capacities as officers of parent, and any individual who shall hereafter succeed to any such office of parent, and each of them individually, such stockholder's proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such stockholder, to vote such stockholder's subject shares, or grant a consent or approval in respect of such subject shares against (i) any takeover proposal or (ii) any amendment of the company's articles of incorporation or by-laws, or other proposal or transaction (including any consent solicitation to remove or elect any directors of the company) involving the company which amendment or other proposal or transaction would be reasonably likely to impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify, or result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the company under or with respect to, the offer, the merger, the merger agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. (b) such stockholder represents that any proxies heretofore given in respect of such stockholder's shares are not irrevocable, and that any such proxies are hereby revoked. (c) such stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this section 6 is given in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of the stockholder under this agreement. such stockholder hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and may under no circumstances be revoked. such stockholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of section 212(e) of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"). 7. further assurances. each stockholder will, at parent's expense, from time to time, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents, documents and other instruments as parent may reasonably request for the purpose of effectively carrying out the transactions contemplated by this agreement. 8. certain events. (a) each stockholder agrees that this agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach to such stockholder's subject shares and shall be binding upon any person or entity to which legal or beneficial ownership of such subject shares shall pass, whether by operation of law or otherwise, including without limitation such stockholder's heirs, guardians, administrators or successors. in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, merger, reorganization, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the company affecting the company common stock, or the acquisition of additional shares of company common stock or other voting securities of the company by any stockholder, the number of subject shares listed in schedule a beside the name of such stockholder shall be adjusted appropriately and this agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach to any additional shares of company common stock or other voting securities of the company issued to or acquired by such stockholder. (b) each stockholder agrees that such stockholder will tender to the company, within 10 business days after the date hereof (or, in the event subject shares are acquired subsequent to the date hereof within 10 business days after the date of such acquisition), any and all certificates representing such stockholder's subject shares in order that the company may inscribe upon such certificates the legend in accordance with section 7.10 of the merger agreement. 9. assignment. neither this agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that (i) sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any subsidiary of parent that may be substituted for sub as contemplated by section 2.01 of the merger agreement, and (ii) parent may assign, in its sole discretion, any and all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of parent, provided that parent will remain liable for its obligations hereunder in the event of any assignment pursuant to this clause (ii). subject to the preceding sentence, this agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 10. termination. this agreement, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall terminate upon the date upon which the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, provided that a termination fee has not become, and could not at any time in the future become, payable under the merger agreement, in which case sections 4(g), 7 (as it relates to the other sections of this agreement that survive such termination), 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 shall survive until such termination fee is paid. 11. general provisions. (a) amendments. this agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. (b) notice. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or sent by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to parent in accordance with section 10.02 of the merger agreement and to the stockholders at their respective addresses set forth on schedule a attached hereto (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice). (c) interpretation. when a reference is made in this agreement to sections, such reference shall be to a section to this agreement unless otherwise indicated. the headings contained in this agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this agreement. wherever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this agreement shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the merger agreement. (d) counterparts. this agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more of the counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart. (e) entire agreement; no third-party beneficiaries. this agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) (i) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. (f) governing law. this agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of delaware regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof. (g) voidability. if prior to the execution hereof, the board of directors of the company shall not have duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action, this agreement, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, so that by the execution and delivery hereof parent or sub would become, or could reasonably be expected to become an "interested

the company have approved the acquisition of the company by parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement; whereas, in furtherance of such acquisition, parent proposes to cause sub to make a tender offer to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the company (the "company common stock"; all the outstanding shares of company common stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "shares") at a purchase price of $13.75 per share (the "offer price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this agreement, the "offer"); and the board of directors of the company

parent to enter into this agreement, parent, sub and certain stockholders of the company are entering into a stockholder agreement (the "stockholder agreement") pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other things, agreed to sell all such stockholders' shares to sub at a cash price per share equal 2 to the offer price, or such higher price per share as may be offered by sub in the offer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the stockholder agreement; whereas, concurrently with the execution of this agreement and as an inducement to parent to enter into this agreement, parent and certain stockholders of the company who are employed by the company are entering into noncompetition agreements (the "noncompetition agreements") pursuant to which such

hereby, parent, sub and the company hereby agree as follows: article i the offer section 1.01. the offer. (a) provided that none of the conditions set forth on exhibit a hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than five business days after the date of the public announcement (on the date hereof or the following day) by parent and the company of this agreement, sub shall, and parent shall cause sub to, commence (within the meaning of rule 14d-2 under the exchange act (as hereinafter defined)) the offer. the obligation of sub to, and of parent to cause sub to, commence the offer, conduct and consummate the offer and accept for payment, and pay for, any shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in exhibit a (the "offer conditions") (any of which (other than the condition as to hsr act (as hereinafter defined) compliance) may be waived in whole or in part by sub in its 3 sole discretion, provided that, without the express written consent of the company, sub may not waive the minimum condition (as defined in exhibit a)). sub expressly reserves the right, subject to compliance with the exchange act, to modify the terms of the offer, except that, without the express written consent of the company, sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares subject to the offer, (ii) reduce the offer price, (iii) add to or modify the offer conditions, (iv) except as provided in the next sentence, extend the offer, (v) change the form of consideration payable in the offer or (vi) amend or alter any other term of the offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the shares. notwithstanding the foregoing, sub may, without the consent of the company, (a) extend the offer for a specified period, if at the scheduled or any extended expiration date of the offer any of the offer conditions shall not be satisfied or waived, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, but in no event to a date more than 90 calendar days from the commencement of the offer, (b) extend the offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") or the staff thereof applicable to the offer, (c) extend the offer pursuant to section 9.01(d) and (d) extend the offer for any reason on one or more occasions for an aggregate period of not more than 5 business days beyond the latest expiration date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (a), (b) or (c) of this sentence; provided, however, that the aggregate period of all extensions under clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) may not extend the expiration date of the offer to a date more than 90 calendar days from the commencement of the offer. subject to the terms and conditions of the offer and this section 1.01(a), sub shall, and parent shall cause sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer that sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the offer.

(b) on the date the offer documents are filed with the sec, or promptly thereafter, the company shall file with the sec a solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 with respect to the offer (such schedule 14d-9, as amended from time to time, the "schedule 14d-9") containing the recommendation described in paragraph 1.02(a) and shall mail the schedule 14d-9 to the stockholders of

stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the company with respect to written information supplied by parent or sub specifically for inclusion in the schedule 14d-9. each of the company, parent and sub agrees promptly to correct any written information provided by it for use in the schedule 14d-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the company further agrees to

14d-9 prior to its filing with the sec or dissemination to stockholders of the company. the company agrees to provide parent and its counsel any comments the company or its counsel may receive from the sec or its staff with respect to the schedule 14d-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments. 6 (c) in connection with the offer and the merger, the company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of shares as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other information in the company's possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of shares, and shall furnish to sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as parent may reasonably request in communicating the offer to the company's stockholders. subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the offer documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the merger, parent and sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection with the offer and the merger and, if this agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request, promptly deliver, and will use their best efforts to cause their agents promptly to deliver,

(c) no further ownership rights in company common stock. all cash paid upon the surrender of certificates in accordance with the terms of this article iii shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares formerly represented by such certificates. at the effective time, the stock transfer 11 books of the company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, certificates are presented to the surviving corporation or the paying agent for any reason except notation thereon that a stockholder has elected to exercise his right to appraisal pursuant to the dgcl they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this article iii. (d) no liability. any funds deposited with the paying agent that remain unclaimed by the former stockholders of the company for six (6) months after the effective time shall be paid to the surviving corporation upon demand, and any former stockholders of the company who have not theretofore complied with the instructions for exchanging their certificates provided herein shall thereafter look only to the surviving corporation for payment of their claims for the merger consideration set forth in section 3.01 hereof for each share held by such stockholder, without any interest thereon. none of parent, sub, the company or the paying agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. if any certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the effective time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any payment pursuant to this article iii would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity (as defined in section 4.05)), the cash payment in respect of such certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the surviving corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto. article iv representations and warranties of the company the
