or &#8220;split-off&#8221; transaction. such spin-off or split-off transaction will generally be permitted only if spinco is combined with bhge in a merger transaction, which is referred to as the &#8220;spinco merger,&#8221; in which spinco shareholders will exchange their shares of spinco stock for shares of common stock. no approval or other action of the conflicts committee will be required with respect to these transactions so long as (i)&#160;the number of shares of spinco stock are equal to the number of paired interests held by spinco, (ii)&#160;the exchange ratio of spinco stock for common stock in the spinco merger is equal to the then-current exchange rate set forth in the exchange agreement and (iii)&#160;spinco has no liabilities other than certain specified liabilities. in addition, in connection with the spinco merger, bhge will be required to enter into customary transaction documents, including customary additional documentation if ge intends for the spin-off or split-off transaction to qualify for tax-free treatment. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conflicts committee objects to or proposes to modify any other term of the spinco merger (other than to enforce the key conditions and customary nature of the documentation described above), ge may undertake the spin-off and split-off transaction without the spinco merger so long as spinco agrees to assume ge&#8217;s obligations under the stockholders agreement. ge&#8217;s right to effect a spin-off or split-off transaction as described above is also subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement, including the restriction on transferring shares of common stock for two years. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; dissolution &#160; the bhge llc agreement provides that the unanimous consent of all members holding voting common units is required to voluntarily dissolve bhge llc. in addition to a voluntary dissolution, bhge llc may be dissolved upon the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution or upon other circumstances in accordance with delaware law. upon a dissolution event, the proceeds of a liquidation are distributed in the following order: (i)&#160;pay the expenses of winding up bhge llc; (ii)&#160;pay debts and liabilities owed to creditors of bhge llc; and (iii)&#160;to the members pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage ownership interests in bhge llc (as determined based on the number of common units held by a member relative to the aggregate number of all outstanding common units). &#160; &#160; corporate opportunities and waiver of fiduciary duty &#160; the bhge llc agreement provides that, subject to the stockholders agreement, ge and bhge llc may enter into certain agreements or transactions with each other or agree to restraints on their competition with each other, and such agreements or restraints on competition will not be considered contrary to any fiduciary duty owed by ge or any officer or director of bhge llc to bhge llc or any holder of an equity interest in bhge llc. the bhge llc agreement also provides that, subject to certain limitations, ge has no duty to refrain from (i)&#160;engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as bhge llc or (ii)&#160;doing business with any of the clients, customers or vendors of bhge llc, and neither ge nor any of its officers or directors will be deemed to have breached any fiduciary duty owed to bhge llc because it engages in any of the preceding activities. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; indemnification and d&amp;o insurance &#160; the bhge llc agreement provides for indemnification by bhge llc of any member or affiliate, the managing member or any of its affiliates, any officer of bhge or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, or any individual who, while an officer of bhge llc or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, is serving at the request of bhge llc or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries as an officer, director, principal, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise. such persons are entitled to payment in advance of expenses, including attorneys&#8217; fees, that they incur in defending a proceeding, but they will be required to repay any such advance if it is ultimately determined that they were not entitled to indemnification by bhge llc. indemnification is not available for any expenses, liabilities, damages and losses suffered that are attributable to any such person&#8217;s or its affiliates&#8217; gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violation of the law or for any present or future breaches of any representations, warranties or covenants contained in the bhge llc agreement or in other agreements with bhge llc. furthermore, no indemnification is available to any such person in respect of any taxes or related interest or penalties imposed on such person as a result of certain tax allocations pursuant to the bhge llc agreement. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; under the bhge llc agreement, bhge llc maintains and will maintain directors and officers liability insurance. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; tax classification &#160; the bhge llc agreement provides that the members intend that bhge llc be treated as a partnership for u.s. federal and, if applicable, state or local income tax purposes, and that each member and bhge llc will file all tax returns and will take all tax and financial reporting positions in a manner consistent with such tax treatment. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; amendments &#160; the bhge llc agreement may be amended with the consent of its managing member and the holders of a majority of the voting common units not held by bhge members. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; exchange agreement &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; at closing, ge, bhge and bhge llc entered into the exchange agreement, and ge oil &amp; gas us holdings i, inc., ge oil &amp; gas us holdings, iv, inc. and ge holdings (us), inc. signed joinders thereby becoming party thereto, pursuant to and subject to the terms of which ge and such affiliates of ge (together, the &#8220; ge parties &#8221;) have the right to surrender paired interests to bhge llc in exchange for (i)&#160;shares of class&#160;a common stock on a one-to-one basis, subject to (x)&#160;customary exchange rate adjustments for stock or unit splits, stock or unit dividends or distributions, reclassifications and other similar transactions, (y)&#160;adjustments to reflect any repurchases of class&#160;a common stock by bhge to the extent that the repurchase was not funded by a redemption of common units by bhge llc and (z) any adjustments to reflect any purchases of common units by bhge that are not funded by an issuance of class a common stock or (ii)&#160;at the option of bhge (or bhge llc on behalf of bhge), an amount of cash equal to the aggregate value of the shares of class&#160;a common stock that otherwise would be received by the applicable ge party in the exchange. however, the ge parties do not have the right to exchange any paired interests if, after making the exchange and after giving effect to any disposition of class&#160;a common stock made by a ge party immediately following the exchange, the ge parties would collectively own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of class&#160;a common stock. &#160; the following summary of the terms of the exchange agreement is not a complete description thereof and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such agreement which is filed as exhibit 99.6 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. &#160; subject to certain restrictions under the stockholders agreement, in the event of a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to class&#160;a common stock, the ge parties will be permitted to exchange paired interests for an equivalent number of shares of class&#160;a common stock and participate in the transaction. after the trigger date, the ge parties will be required to participate in the transaction if it is (i)&#160;a merger or consolidation that would result in holders of common stock immediately prior to the merger or consolidation holding a majority of the voting power of the capital stock in a different entity following the merger or consolidation, (ii)&#160;the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of bhge or (iii)&#160;the acquisition by any party other than ge of a majority of the outstanding equity interests of bhge that are entitled to vote in elections of directors to the bhge board. &#160; bhge is required at all times to reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued class&#160;a common stock, solely for the purpose of the issuance upon an exchange, the maximum number of shares of class a common stock to be delivered in an exchange, and is required to take all other actions necessary to preserve the one-to-one ratio (or, if different, the applicable exchange rate) between the common units owned by bhge members and the number of shares of class&#160;a common stock then outstanding. bhge and bhge llc are required to take all actions necessary so that the number of common units outstanding equals the aggregate number of shares of class&#160;a common stock and class&#160;b common stock outstanding, except to the extent that the exchange rate is not one-to-one. &#160; furthermore, following an exchange in accordance with the terms of the exchange agreement, each share of class&#160;b common stock subject to the exchange will be canceled by bhge and the common unit constituting a component of the exchange will be deemed transferred from ge to bhge. if the exchange is made for a cash payment, as described in the first paragraph of this summary of the exchange agreement, instead of shares of class&#160;a common stock, such common unit will be redeemed (or canceled and deemed redeemed) by bhge llc. &#160; registration rights agreement &#160; at closing, bhge entered into the registration rights agreement to grant ge certain registration rights with respect to its registrable securities, consisting of shares of class&#160;a common stock (including shares issuable upon the exchange of class&#160;b common stock and common units and other securities issued or issuable with respect to such shares). &#160; &#160; the following summary of the terms of the registration rights agreement is not a complete description thereof and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such agreement which is filed as exhibit 99.7 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. &#160; ge may require bhge pursuant to a demand to register under the securities act or the exchange act all or any portion of these registrable securities under the securities act or the exchange act for their public offering, listing or trading. ge may also demand registration of securities of any wholly owned subsidiary of ge in connection with, and subject to the requirements applicable to, a permitted spin transaction (as defined in the bhge llc agreement). bhge will not be obligated to effect a demand registration within 60 days after the effective date of a previous demand registration, other than a shelf registration or if the demand request is for a number of registrable securities with a market value of less than $50&#160;million. &#160; subject to certain exceptions, bhge may defer the filing of a registration statement after a demand request has been made if: (i)&#160;the bhge board determines in good faith that such registration would be materially detrimental to bhge and its stockholders, or (ii)&#160;prior to receiving such demand request, the bhge board had determined to effect a registered public offering of bhge securities for its account and bhge has taken substantial steps to effect such offering. &#160; in addition, ge has piggyback registration rights, which means that ge and its permitted transferees may include their registrable securities in future registrations of equity securities by bhge, whether or not that registration relates to a primary offering by bhge or a secondary offering by or on behalf of any other stockholders of bhge. &#160; the demand registration rights and piggyback registrations are each subject to market cut-back exceptions, with specified priorities. &#160; bhge will pay all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to the registration rights agreement, except underwriting discounts, commissions or fees attributable to the sale of shares by the registering stockholder. the registration rights agreement sets forth customary registration procedures, including an agreement by bhge to make its management available for road show presentations in connection with any underwritten offerings. bhge also agrees to indemnify ge and its affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted by law, with respect to liabilities resulting from untrue statements or omissions in any registration statement used in any such registration, other than untrue statements or omissions resulting from information furnished to bhge for use in the registration statement by ge or the registering stockholder. &#160; ge may transfer its rights under the registration rights agreement to any permitted transferee under the stockholders agreement who becomes a party to, and agrees to be bound by the terms of, the registration rights agreement. the rights of ge and its permitted transferees under the registration rights agreement will remain in effect with respect to the registrable securities covered by the agreement until those securities: (i)&#160;have been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act; (ii)&#160;have been sold to the public pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act; (iii)&#160;have been transferred in a transaction where the subsequent public distribution of the securities would not require registration under the securities act or any similar state law; (iv)&#160;are no longer outstanding; (v)&#160;in case of registrable securities held by a holder other than ge or its affiliates, such holder holds less than 5% of the then outstanding registrable securities and such securities are eligible for sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act; or (vi)&#160;in the case of registrable securities held by ge or its affiliates, ge or its affiliates holds less than 3% of the then outstanding registrable securities and such securities are eligible for sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act. &#160; &#160; tax matters agreement &#160; at closing, bhge, ge, ehhc and bhge llc entered into a tax matters agreement (the &#8220; tax matters agreement &#8221;). the tax matters agreement governs the administration and allocation between the parties of tax liabilities and benefits arising prior to, as a result of, and subsequent to the transactions, including certain restructuring transactions in connection therewith, and the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of ge and bhge, with respect to various other tax matters. &#160; the following summary of the terms of the tax matters agreement is not a complete description thereof and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such agreement which is filed as exhibit 99.8 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. &#160; under the tax matters agreement, bhge llc generally is responsible for any (i)&#160;pre-closing taxes of baker hughes and its subsidiaries, and (ii)&#160;pre-closing non-income taxes of ge o&amp;g, in each case, other than certain taxes related to the transactions, including restructuring transactions, for which ge will be responsible. ge generally is responsible for (i)&#160;any pre-closing income taxes of ge o&amp;g, and (ii)&#160;certain taxes related to the transactions, including restructuring transactions, undertaken by ge and baker hughes (and their respective subsidiaries). &#160; following closing, bhge or bhge llc (or their respective subsidiaries) may be included in group tax returns with ge. if and to the extent a bhge or bhge llc entity is included in such group tax returns, (i) bhge or bhge llc will be required to pay ge an amount intended to approximate the amount that such entity would have paid if it had not been included in such group tax returns and had filed separate tax returns, and (ii) ge will be required to pay bhge or bhge llc the amount of any reduction in taxes payable with respect to the applicable group tax return that results from losses that would have been reflected on such separate tax returns. &#160; the tax matters agreement also provides for the sharing of certain tax benefits (i) arising from the transactions, including restructuring transactions, and (ii) resulting from allocations of tax items by bhge llc. ge is entitled to 100% of these tax benefits to the extent that ge has borne any taxes, after utilization of legacy bhge tax attributes, arising from certain of the transactions, including restructuring transactions. thereafter, these tax benefits will be shared by ge and bhge in accordance with their economic ownership of bhge llc, which immediately following closing is approximately 62.5% and approximately 37.5%, respectively. bhge llc may be required to make cash payments to bhge members or ge relating to the sharing of these tax benefits. any such cash payments may be subject to adjustment based on certain subsequent events, including tax audits or other determinations as to the availability of the tax benefits with respect to which such cash payments were previously made. &#160; ge also is entitled to 50% of the actual tax savings of bhge derived from certain tax attributes resulting from an exchange by ge of paired interests for shares of class&#160;a common stock (or, at the option of bhge, cash) pursuant to the exchange agreement (referred to below as the &#8220; exchange benefits &#8221;). such an exchange by ge is precluded for a period of two years beginning on the closing date. &#160; upon an exchange (other than in connection with a spin-off or split-off), exchange benefits would generally be expected to relate to an adjustment of the tax basis of the assets of bhge llc based on the difference between the fair market value at the time of the exchange and the historic tax basis. such a change in tax basis of assets would cause a revaluation of deferred taxes of bhge based on the difference between the book value of assets and the new tax basis of assets. any resulting deferred tax asset would be subject to a valuation allowance if, and to the extent, it is not more likely than not to be realized. in addition, bhge&#8217;s liability to ge would be recorded at the best estimate of any eventual payments to be made when such payments are considered probable and estimable. &#160; &#160; in the event of certain material breaches by bhge of its payment obligations with respect to exchange benefits together with certain events relating to the creditworthiness of bhge, obligations under the tax matters agreement with respect to the exchange benefits would accelerate and become payable based on certain assumptions, including the assumption that bhge would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize any potential future exchange benefits. in addition, upon certain mergers, assets sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, all payments with respect to exchange benefits following such a change of control would be mutually determined by ge and bhge acting in good faith based on projected standalone taxable income of bhge llc as of immediately prior to such change of control. &#160;
