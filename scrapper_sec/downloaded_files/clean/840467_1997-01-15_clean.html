understanding via overnight delivery november 26, 1996 mr. donald b. hawthorne vice president and cfo biocircuits corporation 1324 chesapeake terrace sunnyvale, ca 94089 re: amendments to agreements dear don: in october, 1996 biocircuits corporation completed a round of equity financing in excess of $3,250,000 (the "october equity financing"). this event satisfied a condition precedent set forth in section 8 of biocircuits' convertible secured promissory note (the "note") held by beckman dated august 15, 1995 which gave beckman the right to convert the note to biocircuits' stock and warrants. in consideration for beckman waiving that right, biocircuits agreed to make certain changes in the note and the related investment rights agreement between the parties dated august 15, 1995 ("rights agreement"). these changes are set forth below. note - ---- 1. with respect to the october equity financing only, beckman waives its rights to convert the note granted by section 8 of the note. 2. the december 31, 1996 date in section 9 of the note is changed to november 15, 1996. 3. in any 30 day period after the conversion by beckman of the note into biocircuits' equity, beckman covenants not to sell more than one-twelfth (the "allotment shares") of the total number of shares issued by biocircuits to beckman upon such conversion. if, however, in any subsequent 30 day period, beckman fails to sell any portion of the allotment shares from the prior 30 day period, then beckman may sell up to mr. donald b. hawthorne november 26, 1996 page 2 one-sixth of the total number of shares issued to beckman in such subsequent 30 day period. in no event, however, may beckman sell more than one-sixth of the shares issued to it by biocircuits in any 30 day period. rights agreement - ---------------- 1. clauses (ii), (iv) and (v) of section 2.2.2 are deleted. 2. clause (iii) of section 2.2.2 is amended to read in its entirety as follows: "(iii) (x) for the period prior to and including december 15, 1996, if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the chairman of the board of directors of the company stating that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, the requested filing of a form s-3 at such time would have a material adverse effect on the company and its stockholders; provided, however, that the company will not initiate, take or support any action that would, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors, cause such material adverse effect to occur, or (y) for the period after december 15, 1996, if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the chairman of the board of directors of the company stating that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, the requested filing of a form s-3 at such time would have a material adverse effect on the company; provided, however, that if either of the events specified in this clause (iii)(x) or (y) shall occur, then in such event, the company shall have the right to defer the filing of the form s-3 registration statement for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the initiating holders under this section 2.2; provided, further, that such right to delay a request shall be exercised by the company not more than twice in any one-year period, and in any event not consecutively with respect to any one request. 3. registrable securities includes common stock issued upon conversion of the note, subject to the terms and conditions of section 2.2 of the rights agreement,
