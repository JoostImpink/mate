(c) the stockholders and the company acknowledge that, in any such case, to the extent a court might hold that the conduct of such activity is a breach of a duty to the company, the stockholders and the company hereby waive any and all claims and causes of action that the stockholders or the company may have for such activities. the stockholders and the company further agree that the waivers and agreements in this agreement identify certain types and categories of activities which do not violate the director's duty of loyalty to the company, and such types and categories are not manifestly unreasonable. the waivers and agreements in this agreement apply equally to activities conducted in the future and that have been conducted in the past. -13- 22. jurisdiction; consent to service of process. ------------------------------------------- (a) each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to submit, for itself and its property, to the jurisdiction of the new york state court located in the borough of manhattan, city of new york or the united states district for the southern district of new york (as applicable, a "new york court"), and any appellate court from any such court, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment resulting from any such suit, action or proceeding, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the new york court.

(a) requests for registration. at any time and from time to time 180 calendar days after the date on which a registration statement of the company on form s-1 or any similar form with respect to the common stock of the company filed by the company becomes effective, the holders of registrable securities will have the right by written notice delivered to the company (a "demand notice") to require the company to register (a "demand registration") under and in accordance with the provisions of the securities act a number of registrable securities that would reasonably be expected to result in aggregate gross proceeds from such offering of not less than $10,000,000 ($1,000,000 with respect to any demand registration requested to be effected as a "shelf" registration on form s-3 or any similar successor form) (each, the "minimum amount"); provided, however, that no demand notice may be given prior to 60 calendar days after the effective date of the immediately preceding demand registration. the company will be responsible for all registration expenses related to the first three demand registrations pursuant to this section 3(a) that are underwritten offerings; provided, however, that there shall be excluded therefrom (1) any demand registration that is an underwritten registration if the managing underwriter or underwriters have advised the holders of registrable securities that the total number of registrable securities requested to be included therein exceeds the number of registrable securities that can be sold in such offering in accordance with the provisions of this agreement without adversely affecting the success of such offering, (2) any demand registration that does not become effective or is not maintained effective for the period required pursuant to section 3(b) hereof, unless in the case of this clause (2) such demand registration does not become effective after being filed by the company solely by reason of the refusal to proceed by the holders of registrable securities unless (i) the refusal to proceed is based upon the advice of counsel relating to a matter with respect to the company or (ii) the holders of the registrable securities elect to pay all registration expenses in connection with such demand registration, (3) any demand registration in connection with which any other stockholder of the company exercises a right of first refusal which it may otherwise have and purchases all the stock registered and to be sold pursuant to the demand registration, and (4) any demand registration as to which the company exercises any rights under sections 3(d) or 4(b) hereof. -3- (b) filing and effectiveness. the company will file a registration statement relating to any demand registration within 30 calendar days, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the same to be declared effective by the sec within 90 calendar days, of the date on which the holders of registrable securities first give the demand notice required by section 3(a) hereof with respect to such demand registration. all requests made pursuant to this section 3 will specify the number of registrable securities to be registered and will also specify the intended methods of disposition thereof, provided, that if the holders demanding such registration specify one particular type of underwritten offering, the company will use its reasonable best efforts to use such method of disposition as the type of underwritten offering or a series of such underwritten offerings (as such demanding holders of registrable securities may elect) during the period during which the registration statement is effective. if any demand registration is requested to be effected as a "shelf" registration by the holders of registrable securities demanding such demand registration, the company will keep the registration statement filed in respect thereof effective for such period as may be requested by the holder demanding such registration, but will not be required to keep the registration statement effective in respect of any single demand registration for longer than twelve months from the date on which the sec declares such registration statement effective (subject to extension pursuant to sections 5 and 6 hereof) or such shorter period that will terminate when all registrable securities covered by such registration statement have been sold pursuant to such registration statement. within five calendar days after receipt of such demand notice, the company will promptly serve written notice thereof (the "notice") to all other holders of registrable securities and will, subject to the provisions of section 3(c) hereof, include in such registration all registrable securities with respect to which the company receives written requests for inclusion therein within 15 calendar days after the receipt of the notice by the applicable holder. the holders of registrable securities will be permitted to withdraw registrable securities from a registration at any time prior to the effective date of such registration provided the remaining number of registrable securities subject to a demand notice is not less than the applicable minimum amount. (c) priority on demand registration. with respect to any demand registration of registrable securities to be sold in one or more firm commitment underwritten offerings, the company may also provide written notice to holders of its shares (other than registrable securities), if any, who have piggyback registration rights with respect thereto and permit all such holders who request to be included in the demand registration to include any or all shares held by such holders in such demand registration on the same terms and conditions as the registrable securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of the offering to which such demand registration relates advise the holders of registrable securities that the total amount of registrable securities and securities that such equity security holders intend to include in such demand registration is in the aggregate such as to adversely affect the success of such offering, then (i) first, the amount of securities to be offered for the account of the holders of such other shares (other than registrable securities) will be reduced, to zero if necessary (pro rata among such holders on the basis of the amount of such other securities to be included therein by each such holder), and (ii) second, the number of registrable securities included in such demand registration will, if necessary, be reduced and there will be included in such firm commitment underwritten offering only the number of registrable securities that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without adversely affecting the success of such offering, allocated pro rata among the holders of registrable securities on the basis of the amount of registrable securities requested to be included therein by each such holder. -4- (d) postponement of demand registration. the company will be entitled to postpone the filing period (or suspend the effectiveness) of any demand registration for a reasonable period of time not in excess of 60 calendar days during any twelve-month period, if the company determines, in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment, that such registration and offering could materially interfere with bona fide financing plans of the company or would require disclosure of information, the premature disclosure of which could materially and adversely affect the company. if the company postpones the filing of a registration statement, it will promptly notify the holders of registrable securities in writing of the postponement, the reasons therefor and the proposed length of the postponement and promptly notify such holders in writing when the events or circumstances permitting such postponement have ended. 4. piggyback registration. (a) right to piggyback. if at any time the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering of any class of shares (other than a registration statement (i) on form s-4, s-8 or any successor form thereto or (ii) filed solely in connection with an offering made solely to employees of the company), whether or not for its own account, then the company will give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of registrable securities promptly, but in any event at least 15 calendar days before the anticipated filing date. such notice will offer such holders the opportunity to register such amount of registrable securities as each such holder may request (a "piggyback registration"). subject to section 4(b) hereof, the company will include in each such piggyback registration all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein. the holders of registrable securities will be permitted to withdraw all or part of the registrable securities from a piggyback registration at any time prior to the effective date of such piggyback registration. if the company offers any securities for its own account in any piggyback registration, the company will be responsible for all registration expenses related to such piggyback registration. if the company does not offer any securities for its own account in a piggyback registration, all registration expenses shall be borne pro rata among all holders of registrable securities whose shares are being registered in such piggyback registration based on the number of registrable securities included therein. (b) priority on piggyback registrations. the company will cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit holders of registrable securities requested to be included in the registration for such offering to include therein all such registrable securities requested to be so included on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities, if any, of the company included therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering deliver an opinion to the holders of registrable securities to the effect that the total amount of securities which such holders, the company and any other persons having rights to participate in such registration propose to include in such offering is such as to adversely affect the success of such offering, then: (i) if such registration is a primary registration on behalf of the company, the amount of securities to be included therein for the account of all other persons other than holders of registrable securities and the company will be reduced (to zero if necessary) pro rata in proportion to the respective amounts of securities requested to be included therein to the extent necessary to reduce the total amount of securities to be included in such offering to the amount recommended by such managing underwriter or underwriters and, thereafter, if such reduction is not sufficient so as, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, to permit the inclusion of registrable securities without -5- adversely affecting the success of the offering, the amount of registrable securities so included in the registration statement for the account of holders of registrable securities (allocated pro rata among such holders on the basis of the registrable securities requested to be included therein by each such holder) will be reduced (to zero if necessary) to the amount recommended by such managing underwriter or underwriters, provided, however, that the company may exercise the right under this section 4(b) on only two occasions; and (ii) if such registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of securities of the company other than the company or holders of registrable securities, then the priority provisions applicable to demand registrations under section 3(c) will apply. (c) registration of securities other than registrable securities. without the written consent of the holders of 66% of the then-outstanding registrable securities, the company will not grant to any person the right to request the company to register any equity securities of the company under the securities act unless the rights so granted are subject to the prior rights of the holders of registrable securities set forth herein and, if exercised, would not otherwise conflict or be inconsistent with the provisions of, this agreement. 5. restrictions on sale by holders of registrable securities. each holder of registrable securities whose registrable securities are covered by a registration statement filed pursuant to section 3 or section 4 hereof agrees, and will confirm such agreement in writing if such holder is so requested (pursuant to a timely written notice) by the managing underwriter or underwriters in an underwritten offering, not to effect any public sale or distribution of any of the company's shares (except as part of such underwritten offering), including a sale pursuant to rule 144, during the 10-calendar day period prior to, and during the 90-calendar day period (or such shorter period as to which the managing underwriter or underwriters may require of any officer, director or other stockholder bound by any similar limitation in connection with any underwritten public offering.) beginning on, the closing date of each underwritten offering made pursuant to such registration statement. if a request is made pursuant to this section 5, the time period during which a demand registration (if a shelf registration) is required to remain continuously effective pursuant to section 3(b) will be extended by 100 calendar days or such shorter period that will terminate when all such registrable securities not so included have been sold pursuant to such registration statement. 6. registration procedures. in connection with the company's registration obligations pursuant to sections 3 and 4 hereof, the company will effect such registrations to permit the sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the company will as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement or registration statements on any appropriate form under the securities act available for the sale of the registrable securities by the holders thereof in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and cause each such registration statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided, however, that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto -6- (including documents that would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), the company will furnish to the holders of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement, the special counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, and will provide such holders, the special counsel and such underwriters a reasonable period of time to review and comment on such documents. the company will not file any such registration statement or amendment thereto or any prospectus or any supplement thereto (including such documents which, upon filing, would or would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) to which the holders of a majority of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement, the special counsel or the managing underwriter, if any, shall reasonably object on a timely basis; (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and post-effective amendments to each registration statement as may be necessary to keep such registration statement continuously effective for the applicable period specified in section 3; cause the related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) under the securities act; and comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement as so amended or to such prospectus as so supplemented; (c) notify the selling holders of registrable securities, the special counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, promptly, and (if requested by any such person) confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any request by the sec or any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a registration statement or related prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the sec or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) if at any time the representations and warranties of the company contained in any agreement contemplated by section 6(m) hereof (including any underwriting agreement) cease to be true and correct in any material respect, (v) of the receipt by the company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (vi) of the occurrence of any event which makes any statement made in such registration statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or which requires the making of any changes in a registration statement, prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the registration statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and, in the case of the prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated or is necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vii) of the company's determination that a post-effective amendment to a registration statement would be appropriate. (d) use every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption -7- from qualification) of any of the registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest reasonably possible moment; (e) if requested by the managing underwriters, if any, or the holders of a majority of the registrable securities being registered, (i) promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post- effective amendment such information as the managing underwriters, if any, and such holders agree should be included therein as may be required by applicable law and (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; provided, however, that the company will not be required to take any actions under this section 6(e) that are not, in the opinion of counsel for the company, in compliance with applicable law; (f) furnish to each selling holder of registrable securities, the special counsel and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, at least one conformed copy of the registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements (but excluding schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits, unless requested in writing by such holder, counsel or underwriter); (g) deliver to each selling holder of registrable securities, the special counsel and the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of the prospectus or prospectuses relating to such registrable securities (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such persons may request; and the company hereby consents to the use of such prospectus or each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling holders of registrable securities and the underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the registrable securities covered by such prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto provided that each such selling holder and each of the underwriters shall cease using such prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto immediately upon receipt of written notice from the company; (h) prior to any public offering of registrable securities, register or qualify or cooperate with the selling, holders of registrable securities, the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such registrable securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions within the united states as any seller or underwriter reasonably requests in writing; keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period such registration statement is required to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdiction of the registrable securities covered by the applicable registration statement; provided, however that the company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business or pay taxes in any jurisdiction in which it is not then so qualified or so required or (ii) take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction in which it is not then so subject; (i) cooperate with the selling holders of registrable securities and the managing underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing registrable securities to be sold, which certificates will not bear any restrictive legends; and enable such registrable securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriters, if any, shall request at least two business days prior to any sale of registrable securities to the underwriters; -8- (j) cause the registrable securities covered by the applicable registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities within the united states except as may be required solely as a consequence of the nature of such selling holder's business, in which case the company will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the filing of such registration statement and the granting of such approvals as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities; (k) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by section 6(c)(vi) or 6(c)(vii) hereof, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to each registration statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the stockholders of the registrable securities being sold thereunder, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (l) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all registrable securities covered by such registration statement to be listed on each securities exchange, if any, on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed; (m) enter into such agreements (including, in the event of an underwritten offering, an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings) and take all such other actions in connection therewith (including those requested by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities being sold or, in the event of an underwritten offering, those requested by the managing underwriters) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such registrable securities and in such connection, whether or not an underwriting agreement is entered into and whether or not the registration is an underwritten registration, (i) make such representations and warranties to the holders of such registrable securities and the underwriters, if any, with respect to the business of the company and its subsidiaries, the registration statement, prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same if and when requested; (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the managing underwriters, if any, and the holders of a majority of the registrable securities being sold) addressed to such selling holders of registrable securities and each of the underwriters, if any, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by such holders and underwriters, including without limitation the matters referred to in clause (i) above; (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the company (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the company or of any business acquired by the company for which financial statements and financial data is, or is required to be, included in the registration statement), addressed to each selling holder of registrable securities and each of the underwriters, if any, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings; and (iv) deliver such documents and certificates as may be requested by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities being sold, the special counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, to -9- evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the company and its subsidiaries made pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or similar agreement entered into by the company. the foregoing actions will be taken in connection with each closing under such underwriting or similar agreement as and to the extent required thereunder; (n) make available for inspection by a representative of the holders of registrable securities being sold, any underwriter participating in any disposition of registrable securities, and any attorney or accountant retained by such selling holders or underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the company and its subsidiaries, and cause the officers, directors and employees of the company and its subsidiaries to supply all information reasonably requested by any such representative, underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with such registration statement;

(a) indemnification by the company. the company will, without limitation as to time, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each holder of registrable securities registered pursuant to this agreement, the officers, directors and agents and employees of each of them, each person who controls such holder (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act) and the officers, directors, agents and employees of any such controlling person, from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including without limitation the costs of investigation and attorneys' fees) and expenses (collectively, 'losses"), as incurred, arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are based solely upon information furnished in writing to the company by such holder expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable to any holder of registrable securities to the extent that any such losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus if either (a) (i) such holder failed to send or deliver a copy of the prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale by such holder of a registrable security to the person asserting the claim from which such losses arise and (ii) the prospectus would have completely corrected such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or such omission or alleged omission; or (b) such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or such omission or alleged omission is completely corrected in an amendment or supplement to the prospectus previously furnished by or on behalf of the company with copies of the prospectus as so amended or supplemented, and such holder thereafter fails to deliver such prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently with the sale of a registrable security to the person asserting the claim from which such losses arise. the rights of any holder of registrable securities hereunder will not be exclusive of the rights of any holder of registrable securities under any other agreement or instrument of any holder of registrable securities to which the company is a party. nothing in such other agreement or instrument will be interpreted as limiting or otherwise adversely affecting a holder of registrable securities hereunder and nothing in this agreement will be interpreted as limiting or otherwise adversely affecting the holder of registrable securities' rights under any such other agreement or instrument, provided, however , that no indemnified party will be entitled hereunder to recover more than its indemnified losses. (b) indemnification by holders of registrable securities. in connection with any registration statement in which a holder of registrable securities is participating, such holder of registrable securities -11- will furnish to the company in writing such information as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any registration statement or prospectus and will severally indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the company, its directors and officers, agents and employees, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons, from and against all losses arising out of or based upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or arising out of or based upon any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is finally judicially determined to have been contained in any information so furnished in writing by such holder to the company expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus and was relied upon by the company in the preparation of such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus. in no event will the liability of any selling holder of registrable securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of payment of all expenses and underwriter's discounts and commissions) received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any person shall become entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "indemnified party"), such indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the party from which such indemnity is sought (the "indemnifying party") of any claim or of the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any obligation or liability except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been prejudiced materially by such failure. all fees and expenses (including any fees and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or proceeding) will be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within five calendar days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). the indemnifying party will not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or otherwise seek to terminate any action or proceeding in which any indemnified party is or could be a party and as to which indemnification or contribution could be sought by such indemnified party under this section 8, unless such judgment, settlement or other termination includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release, in form and substance satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation for which such indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses or is insufficient to hold such indemnified party harmless, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, will, jointly and severally, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or indemnifying parties, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party or indemnifying parties, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or related to information supplied by, such -12- indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses will be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any action or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provision of this section 8(d), an indemnifying party that is a selling holder of registrable securities will not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities sold by such indemnifying party and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the provisions of this section 8 will survive so long as registrable securities remain outstanding, notwithstanding any transfer of the registrable securities by any holder thereof or any termination of this agreement. 9. rules 144 and 144a. the company will file the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act in a timely manner, and will cooperate with any holder of registrable securities (including without limitation by making such representations as any such holder may reasonably request), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitations of the exemptions provided by rules 144 and 144a (including without limitation the requirements of rule 144a(d)(4)). upon the request of any holder of registrable securities, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such filing requirements. 10. underwritten registrations. if any of the registrable securities covered by any demand registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the holder of registrable securities that gave the demand notice with respect to such offering; provided, that such investment banker or manager shall be reasonably satisfactory to the company. if any piggyback registration is an underwritten offering, the company will have the right to select the investment banker or investment bankers and managers to administer the offering. 11. miscellaneous. (a) no inconsistent agreements. except for the prior registration rights, which shall terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the date of this agreement, the company has not, as of the date hereof, and will not, on or after the date hereof, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of registrable securities in this agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. -13- (b) amendments and waivers. the provisions of this exhibit, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the company has obtained the written consent of holders of 66% of the then-outstanding registrable securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of holders of registrable securities whose securities are being sold pursuant to a registration statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other holders of registrable securities may be given by holders of a majority of the registrable securities being sold by such holders; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. (c) owner of registrable securities. the company will maintain, or will cause its registrar and transfer agent to maintain, a stock book with respect to the common stock, in which all transfers of registrable securities of which the company has received notice will be recorded. the company may deem and treat the person in whose name registrable securities are registered in the stock book of the company as the owner thereof for all purposes, including without limitation the giving of notices under this agreement. (d) attorneys' fees. in any action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision of this agreement, or where any provision hereof is validly asserted as a defense, the prevailing party, as determined by the court, will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other available remedy. -14- ex-3 4 lock-up agreement exhibit 3 lock-up agreement _________, 1999 thomas weisel
