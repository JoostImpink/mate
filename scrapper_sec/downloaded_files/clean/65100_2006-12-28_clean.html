with nasd concerning mlpf&s's alleged failure to include a legend regarding contingent deferred sales charges on certain written confirmations it provided to its customers relating to certain securities issued by ml&co. without admitting or denying the allegations, mlpf&s consented to a censure and agreed to pay a $20,000 fine. in october 2006, merrill lynch entered into a consent agreement with the virginia department of securities pursuant to which, without admitting or denying the allegations, merrill lynch agreed to change its policies and procedures to address certain criticisms noted by the virginia department of securities relating to recommendations for merrill lynch's clients based in virginia and paid $75,000 to defray the cost of the investigation. as part of a settlement relating to managing auctions for auction rate securities, the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "commission") accepted the offers of settlement of 15 broker-dealer firms, including mlpf&s, and issued a settlement order on may 31, 2006. the commission found, and mlpf&s neither admitted nor denied, that respondents (including mlpf&s) violated section 17(a)(2) of the securities act of 1933 by managing auctions for auction rate securities in ways that were not adequately disclosed or that did not conform to disclosed procedures. mlpf&s consented to a cease and desist order, a censure, a civil money penalty, and compliance with certain undertakings. in march 2005, ml&co. and certain of its affiliates (ml&co. and its affiliates collectively, "merrill lynch") reached agreements with the state of new jersey and the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") and reached an agreement in principle with the state of connecticut pursuant to which merrill lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a settlement that included findings that it failed to maintain certain books and records and to reasonably supervise a team of former financial analysts ("fas") who facilitated improper market timing by a hedge fund client. merrill lynch terminated the fas in october 2003, brought the matter to the attention of regulators, and cooperated fully in the regulators' review. the settlement will result in aggregate payments of $13.5 million. the settlement resulted in aggregate payments of $13.5 million. on november 22, 2006, the agreement in principle with the state of connecticut was finalized. in march 2005, merrill lynch reached an agreement in principle with the nyse pursuant to which merrill lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations, later consented to a settlement that included findings with regard to certain matters relating to the failure to deliver prospectuses for certain auction rate preferred shares and open-end mutual funds; the failure to deliver product descriptions with regard to certain exchange-traded funds; the failure to ensure that proper registration qualifications were obtained for certain personnel; issues with regard to the retention, retrieval and review of e-mails; isolated lapses in branch office supervision; late reporting of certain events such as customer complaints and arbitrations; the failure to report certain complaints in quarterly reports to the nyse due to a systems error; and partial non-compliance with continuing education requirements. the settlement resulted in a payment of $10 million to the nyse. on november 3, 2004, a jury in houston, texas convicted four former merrill lynch employees of criminal misconduct in connection with a nigerian barge transaction that the government alleged helped enron inflate its 1999 earnings by $12 million. the jury also found that the transaction led to investor losses of $13.7 million. those convictions were reversed by a federal appellate court on august 1, 2006, except for one conviction against one employee based on perjury and obstruction of justice. the government has appealed the reversals. in 2003, merrill lynch agreed to pay $80 million to settle commission charges that it aided and abetted enron's fraud by engaging in two improper year-end transactions in 1999, including the nigerian barge transaction. the $80 million paid in connection with the settlement with the commission will be made available to settle investor claims. in september 2003, the united states department of justice agreed not to prosecute merrill lynch for crimes that may have been committed by its former employees related to certain transactions with enron, subject to certain understandings, including merrill lynch's continued cooperation with the department, its acceptance of responsibility for conduct of its former employees, and its agreement to adopt and implement new policies and procedures related to the integrity of client and counter-party financial statements, complex structured finance transactions and year-end transactions. on or about june 27, 2003, the attorney general for the state of west virginia brought an action against the defendants that participated in the april 28, 2003, settlement described below. the action, filed in the west virginia - --------------------- ----------------- cusip no. 247126105 schedule 13d page 9 of 30 - --------------------- ----------------- state court, alleged that the defendants' research practices violated the west virginia consumer credit and protection act. on september 16, 2005, the circuit court of marshall county, west virginia, dismissed the case, following an earlier decision by the west virginia supreme court holding that the west virginia attorney general lacked authority to bring the claims. on october 31, 2003, the united states district court for the southern district of new york entered final judgments in connection with alleged conflicts of interest affecting research practices. the final settlements pertaining to merrill lynch, which involved both monetary and non-monetary relief, brought to a conclusion the regulatory actions against merrill lynch related to its research practices. merrill lynch entered into these settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and findings by the regulators, and the settlements did not establish wrongdoing or liability for purposes of any other proceedings. for further information, reference is made to the form adv of merrill lynch on file with, and

million of common stock in the reorganized issuer as follows: (i) each investor would purchase (a) for $35.00 per share, each investor's proportionate share of 6,300,000 shares of the reorganized

on schedule 2 to the investment agreement. additionally, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the investment agreement, the investors would purchase any unsubscribed shares of the reorganized issuer's new common stock in connection with an approximately $2.0 billion rights offering that would be made available to holders of common stock as of a record date to be determined by the issuer. in accordance with the investment agreement, the issuer would distribute certain rights to holders of common stock to acquire new common stock of the reorganized issuer subject to the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the commission, approval of the bankruptcy court and satisfaction of other terms and conditions. the rights, which would be transferable by the original eligible holders, would permit holders to purchase their pro rata share of new common stock of the reorganized issuer at $35.00 per share. altogether, the investors could invest up to an aggregate of $3.4 billion in the reorganized issuer. the investment agreement is subject to the completion of due diligence to the satisfaction of the investors in their sole discretion, satisfaction or waiver of

sole discretion) and the non-exercise by either the issuer or the investors of certain termination rights, all of which are more fully described in the investment agreement. - --------------------- ----------------- cusip no. 247126105 schedule 13d page 11 of 30 - --------------------- ----------------- the investors would be entitled to payment of certain commitment fees and an alternate transaction fee at the times and under the circumstances set forth in the investment agreement. plan of reorganization framework the investors, the issuer and gm also executed on december 18, 2006, a plan framework support agreement (the "plan framework support agreement") which contains terms pursuant to which the parties agree to support confirmation and consummation of a plan of reorganization for the issuer which will be based on the terms contained in the plan framework support agreement (the "plan framework"). a copy of the plan framework support agreement is attached as exhibit 99.a of the form 8-k filed by delphi corporation on december 18, 2006. the plan framework provides for, among other things, the distributions to be made to creditors and stockholders, the treatment of gm's claims against the issuer, the resolution of certain pension funding issues and the corporate governance of the reorganized issuer. the plan framework support agreement as well as the economics and structure of the plan framework itself are conditioned on reaching consensual agreements with the issuer's u.s. labor unions and gm. both the issuer and the investors are permitted to terminate the investment agreement (which terminates the plan framework support agreement) if consensual agreements are not reached with the issuer's u.s. labor unions and gm by january 31, 2007. corporate governance structure the investment agreement and the plan framework support agreement also include certain corporate governance provisions for the reorganized issuer. under the terms of the proposed plan, the reorganized issuer would be governed by a 12 member board of directors, two of whom would be a new executive chairman and a new chief executive officer and president. pursuant to the term sheet for preferred stock attached as an exhibit to the investment agreement (the "preferred term sheet") and plan framework support agreement, rodney o'neal would be the chief executive officer and president of the issuer. a five member selection committee, consisting of john d. opie, the lead independent director of the issuer's current board of directors, a representative of each of the issuer's two statutory committees and a representative of each of appaloosa and cerberus will select the company's post-emergence executive chairman as well as four other directors (one of whom may be from the issuer's current board of directors). appaloosa and cerberus must both concur in the selection of the executive chairman, but do not vote on the four other directors. each of appaloosa and cerberus would appoint three board members comprising the remaining six members of the reorganized issuer's new board of directors. the reporting persons do not have any right to appoint any members of the new board of directors. the new board of directors would be required to satisfy all independence requirements imposed by the relevant stock exchange on which the reorganized issuer's common stock would be traded. executive compensation for the reorganized issuer must be on market terms, must be reasonably acceptable to adah and dolce, and the overall executive compensation plan design must be described in the issuer's disclosure statement and incorporated into the plan of reorganization. the holders of the series a preferred stock will have certain approval rights with respect to certain significant corporate transactions such as incurring debt, transferring assets and engaging in mergers or acquisitions, as more fully described in the preferred term sheet. the reporting persons will not beneficially own any shares of series a preferred stock. except as described in this item 4 or otherwise described in this statement, the reporting persons currently have no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any transaction, event or action enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of the form of schedule 13d promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. subject to the terms of the investment agreement and the plan framework support agreement, each of the reporting persons reserves the right, in light of its or his ongoing evaluation of the issuer's financial condition, business, operations and prospects, the market price of the common stock, conditions in the securities markets generally, general economic and industry conditions, its or his business objectives and other relevant factors, to change its or his plans and intentions at any time, as it or he deems appropriate. in particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing (but subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement), any one or more of the reporting persons (and their respective affiliates) reserves the right, in each case subject to any applicable limitations imposed on the sale of any of their common stock by the securities act of 1933, as amended, or other applicable law, to (i) purchase additional shares of common stock or other securities of the issuer, (ii) sell or transfer shares of common stock or other securities beneficially owned by them from time to time in public or private transactions and (iii) cause any of the reporting persons to distribute in kind to their respective stockholders, - --------------------- ----------------- cusip no. 247126105 schedule 13d page 12 of 30 - ---------------------
