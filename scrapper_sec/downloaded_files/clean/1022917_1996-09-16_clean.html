and (ii) whether the indemnifying party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the indemnified party against such third party claim. if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party within the third party claim response period that the indemnifying party desires to defend the indemnified party against the third party claim, then the indemnifying party at its sole cost and expense shall defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, such third party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted to a final conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the indemnifying party (with the consent of the indemnified party which shall not be unreasonably withheld). the indemnified party will cooperate in such defense at the sole cost and expense of the indemnifying party. the indemnified party may, at its sole cost and expense, at any time prior to the indemnifying party's delivery of the notice referred to in the last sentence of the preceding paragraph, file any pleadings or take any other action that the indemnified party reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to protect its interests. the indemnified party, at its expense, may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any third party claim conducted by the indemnifying party pursuant to this section 8.4(a). if the indemnifying party fails to notify the indemnified party within the third party claim response period that the indemnifying party desires to defend the third party claim or if the indemnifying party gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the third party claim, then the indemnified party shall defend, at the sole cost and expense of the indemnifying party, the third party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the indemnified party in a reasonable manner and in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the indemnified party (with the consent of the - 31 - 43 indemnifying party which shall not be unreasonably withheld). the indemnifying party will, at its sole cost and expense, cooperate in such defense. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 8.4(a), if the indemnifying party is determined not to be liable for such third party claim pursuant to the last paragraph of this section 8.4(a) and section 8.4(c), the indemnifying party will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the indemnified party's defense of the third party claim or the indemnifying party's participation therein pursuant to this section 8.4(a), and the indemnified party will reimburse the indemnifying party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the indemnifying party in connection with such defense. if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party that it does not dispute its liability to the indemnified party with respect to the third party claim under this article viii or fails to notify the indemnified party within the third party claim response period whether the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party with respect to such third party claim, the losses resulting from such third party claim as finally determined will be conclusively deemed to be a liability of the indemnifying party under this article viii, and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such losses to the indemnified party on demand. if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party within the third party claim response period that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party with respect to such claim, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with section 8.4(c) hereof. (b) other claims. in the event any indemnified party should have a claim under this article viii against any indemnifying party that does not involve a third party claim, the indemnified party shall promptly give written notice and the details thereof, including copies of all relevant information and documents (collectively, an "indemnity notice"), to the indemnifying party within a period of thirty (30) days following the discovery of the claim by the indemnified party (the "claim notice period"). the failure by any indemnified party to give the indemnity notice within the claim notice period shall not impair the indemnified party's rights hereunder except to the extent that an indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been prejudiced thereby. the indemnifying party will notify the indemnified party within a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of the indemnify notice by the indemnifying party (the "indemnity response period") whether the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under this article viii with respect to such claim. if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party that it does not dispute the claim described in such indemnity notice or fails to notify the indemnified party within the indemnity response period whether the indemnifying party disputes the claim described in such indemnity notice, the losses resulting from such claim as finally determined will be conclusively deemed to be a liability of the indemnifying party under this article viii and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such losses to the indemnified party on demand. if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party within the indemnity response period that the indemnifying party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within a period of thirty - 32 - 44 (30) days from the date of such notice, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with section 8.4(c) hereof. (c) resolution of disputes. any dispute required to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to this section 8.4 shall be finally and conclusively determined in accordance with the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce (the "rules of arbitration") then in effect by the decision of three (3) arbitrators selected in accordance with the rules of arbitration unless the company and the purchaser shall agree on a single arbitrator (the "board of arbitration"). the board of arbitration shall meet in new york, new york and shall render a decision in writing (concurred in by a majority of the members of the board of arbitration if more than one) with respect to and stating the amount, if any, which the indemnifying party is required to pay to the indemnified party in respect of the claim made by the indemnified party. to the extent practical, the decision of the board of arbitration shall be rendered no more than thirty (30) days following commencement of proceedings with respect thereto. the board of arbitration shall cause its written decision to be delivered to the indemnified party and the indemnifying party. any decision made by the board of arbitration (either prior to or after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period) shall be final, binding and conclusive on the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and entitled to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law and entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. the company and the purchaser hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the foregoing board of arbitration and to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court located in the states of new york or delaware and any national court located in france for the purpose of enforcing the decision or award of the board of arbitration. the company and the purchaser agree that service of process may be made on any such party by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail addressed to the appropriate party at the address for such party specified in section 10.1 hereof. the submission to the jurisdiction of the courts referred to above for the purpose of enforcing the decision or award of the board of arbitration shall not (and shall not be construed so as to) limit the right of either the company or the purchaser to file or commence proceedings against the other in any other court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the decision or award of the board of arbitration nor shall the filing or commencement of proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions for such purpose preclude the filing or taking of proceedings in any other jurisdiction for such purpose (whether concurrently or not) if and to the extent permitted by applicable law. each and every arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this section 8.4(c) shall be consolidated with any arbitration proceeding then pending under this section 8.4(c). section 8.5 continued liability for indemnity claims. the liability of any indemnifying party hereunder with respect to claims hereunder shall continue for so long as any claims for indemnification may be made hereunder pursuant to section 8.8 hereof and, with respect to any such indemnification claims duly and timely made, thereafter until the indemnifying party's liability therefor is finally determined and satisfied. - 33 - 45 section 8.6 limitations on indemnification.

(a) requests for registration. at any time during the registration period, the holders of at least fifty percent (50%) of the registrable securities may request the company to effect a registration under the securities act of all or part of their registrable securities. each request for a demand registration shall specify the number of registrable securities requested to be registered. within ten (10) days after receipt of any such request, the company will give written notice of such requested registration to all other holders of registrable securities and will include in such registration, subject to section 1(c) hereof, all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the company's notice. (b) number of demand registrations. the holders of registrable securities, as a group and not individually, will be entitled to require only one demand registration pursuant to this section 1, provided, however , that in the event all of the holders of the registrable securities irrevocably decide to sell all of the registrable securities then owned by such holders as soon as is practical and so notify the company in writing, then the limitation otherwise imposed by this section 1(b) shall not apply (whether or not a registration has been previously made pursuant to 51 section 1(a)) and such holders shall be entitled to, and do hereby irrevocably agree that they will in fact continue to, exercise their rights set forth in section 1(a), promptly and to the maximum extent permitted by the managing underwriter with respect to any particular registration, until such time as such holders have disposed of all the registrable securities owned by them. a registration will not be considered to be a demand registration unless and until: (i) it has remained effective for three hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days or such shorter period as shall be required to sell all of the securities registered pursuant thereto (but not terminating before the expiration of the applicable prospectus delivery period); and (ii) all registrable securities requested to be included therein are effectively included therein and saleable thereunder. (c) priority on registration. the company may include in any demand registration any securities which are not registrable securities but which are of the same class as the registrable securities and which are held by holders who have piggyback registration rights with respect to the demand registration rights provided under this agreement. if a demand registration is an underwritten offering and the managing underwriters advise the company in writing that in their opinion the number of registrable securities and, if permitted hereunder, other securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number of registrable securities and other securities, if any, which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the holders of a majority of the registrable securities, then the company will include in such registration, prior to the inclusion of any securities which are not registrable securities, the number of registrable securities requested to be included pro rata among the respective holders thereof on the basis of the amount of registrable securities requested by such holders to be included in such registration, so that no securities other than registrable securities will be included in such registration if the inclusion of such securities would result in a limitation on the number of registrable securities to be included therein. (d) restrictions on demand registration. the company may postpone for up to three (3) months the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration if (i) the company, in the good faith judgment of its board of directors, determines that such demand registration would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any proposal or plan by the company or any of its subsidiaries to engage in any acquisition (other than in the ordinary course of business) or any merger, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization, tender offer or similar transaction or negotiations, discussions or pending proposals with respect thereto or would require the company to make premature public disclosure of information, the premature disclosure of which would have a material adverse effect on the business or prospects of the company, or would otherwise be seriously detrimental to the company or its stockholders, and (ii) the company provides the holders of the registrable securities with a written certificate signed by the president of the company stating the reasons of the board of directors for such delay, - 2 - 52 provided, however, that the company may not utilize this right more than once in any twelve (12) month period, and provided further, that, in such event, the holders of registrable securities initially requesting such demand registration will be entitled to withdraw such request and, if such request is withdrawn, such demand registration will not be considered to be a demand registration hereunder, and the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with such registration. (e) selection of underwriters. if any demand registration is in the form of an underwritten offering, the company will select and retain the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that administer the offering; provided, however, that such selection will be subject to the approval of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities participating in such registration, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. the company shall (together with all holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting) enter into and perform its (their) obligations under an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting. if any holder of registrable securities disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the managing underwriter. the registrable securities so withdrawn shall also be withdrawn from registration. section 2. piggyback registrations. (a) right to piggyback. whenever the company proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act (including securities registered for selling stockholders with demand registration rights, subject to the limitations set forth in section 2(d) below) and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of registrable securities, the company will give prompt written notice to all holders of registrable securities, and to the holders of any other securities of the company having registration rights compatible with the proposed registration form, of its intention to effect such a registration and will include in such registration all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the company's notice (a "piggyback registration "). if the company gives notice of such a proposed registration, the total number of registrable securities which shall be included in such registration shall be limited to such number, if any, as in the reasonable opinion of the manager of such offering would not adversely affect the marketability or offering price of all of the securities proposed to be offered by the company in such offering; provided, however, if the holders of registrable securities having registration rights upon a piggyback registration are not permitted to include all of such registrable securities by reason of such determination by the manager of the offering, the registrable securities to be included in the offering shall be determined in accordance with sections 2(c) and 2(d) below. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any holder of registrable securities, withdraw such registration statement and abandon such proposed public offering. - 3 - 53 (b) piggyback expenses. the registration expenses of the holders of the registrable securities will be paid by the company in all piggyback registrations, including proposed piggyback registrations which are abandoned.

(c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. promptly after receipt by an identified party under sections 12(a) or 12(b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this section, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereto is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying party of the threat or commencement thereof, provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. if any such claim or action referred to under sections 12(a) or 12(b) above is brought against any indemnified party and it then notifies the indemnifying party of the threat or commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of any such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this section 12 for any legal expenses of counsel or any other expenses (other than reasonable costs of investigation) subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such claim or action or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such action. the indemnifying party shall not be required to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to any amounts paid in settlement of any action, proceeding or investigation entered into without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. no indemnifying party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of the indemnified party unless (i) such judgment or settlement does not impose any obligation or liability upon the indemnified party other than the execution, delivery or approval thereof, and (ii) such judgment or settlement - 15 - 65 includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a full release and discharge from all liability in respect of such claim and a full release of all persons that may be entitled to or obligated to provide indemnification or contribution under this section. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 12 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under sections 12(a) or 12(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to in sections 12(a) or 12(b) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements, omissions, actions or inactions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party, any action or inaction by any such party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, omission, action or inaction. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) pursuant to this section 12(d) shall be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim (which shall be limited as provided in section 12(c) if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof) which is the subject of this section 12(d). no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 12(d) of written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof with respect to which a claim for contribution may be made against an indemnifying party under this section 12(d), such indemnified party shall, if a claim for contribution in respect thereto is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof (if the notice specified in section 12(c) has not been given with respect to such action), provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any obligation to provide contribution which it may have to any indemnified party under this section 12(d), except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by the failure to give notice. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 12(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section 12(d). if indemnification is available under this section 12, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the fullest extent provided in sections 12(a) - 16 - 66 and 12(b) hereof, without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this section 12(d). the provisions of this section 12(d) shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party, and shall survive the transfer of securities by any such party. (e) indemnification and contribution of underwriters. in connection with any underwritten offering contemplated by this agreement which includes registrable securities, the company and all sellers of registrable securities included in any registration statement shall agree to customary provisions for indemnification and contribution (consistent with the other provisions of this section 12) in respect of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the underwriters of such offering.
