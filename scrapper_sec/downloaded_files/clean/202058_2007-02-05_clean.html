&#148;), between harris and the issuer. other than the matters described herein and in item 4, harris, and to the best of harris&#146; knowledge, the persons listed on schedules i-a and i-b have no other contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer. the investor agreement scope of agreement page 5 of 17 pages the investor agreement sets forth certain terms and conditions upon which harris will hold its equity interests in the issuer. the investor agreement further provides that if there is any inconsistency between the terms of the investor agreement and the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the issuer, the issuer and harris will take all necessary action to amend the certificate of incorporation and bylaws to eliminate the inconsistency to the fullest extent permitted by law. governing instruments and class b shares the investor agreement and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the issuer provide that the class a and class b shares are identical in all respects except that holders of class b shares have the additional right to vote separately as a class to elect, remove and replace the class b directors (as defined below), the right to receive class b shares instead of class a shares in certain circumstances, the absence of certain duties and obligations with respect to corporate opportunities and preemptive rights providing holders of class b shares with the right to participate in additional offerings of the issuer&#146;s common stock. voluntary exchange rights the holders of class b shares have the right at any time to exchange: &#149; any outstanding class a shares held by the holder for an equal number of class b shares or &#149; any outstanding class b shares held by the holder for an equal number of class a shares. mandatory exchange rights each class b share will automatically convert into one class a share under the following circumstances: &#149; the holders of all of the class b shares (assuming all voluntary exchanges of class a to class b shares are made) are collectively entitled to cast less than 10% of the total voting power (as defined below); or &#149; such class b share is transferred by a holder to any person who is not an affiliate of the holder or nominee of the holder or one of its affiliates unless such transfer is part of transfer by the holder and its affiliates of all of the class b shares then owned by them. for purposes of the investor agreement, &#147;total voting power&#148; means, at any time, the total number of votes then entitled to be cast generally in the election of class a directors (as defined below) by all holders of all classes of capital stock or securities of the issuer then outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of class a directors (including the holders of class b shares). page 6 of 17 pages board of directors of the issuer initial board of directors pursuant to the investor agreement, the current board of directors of the issuer consists of nine directors, five of whom were appointed by harris and four of whom were appointed by the former board of directors of stratex. directors appointed by the holders of class b shares pursuant to the investor agreement are referred to as the &#147;class b directors&#148;, and the remaining directors are referred to as the &#147;class a directors.&#148; harris has appointed as class b directors howard l. lance, chairman, president and chief executive officer of harris, guy m. campbell, former president of the microwave communications division of harris and currently chief executive officer and president of the issuer, dr. james c. stoffel, a current director of harris, eric c. evans, and dr. mohsen sohi. the investor agreement also provides that, until the second anniversary of the closing date, one of the class b directors must meet the independence requirements for directors serving on an audit committee as prescribed by the nasdaq rules and one must not be an employee of harris or any of its subsidiaries (without regard to the issuer or any of its subsidiaries). the initial directors will serve until their successors are elected at the issuer&#146;s first annual meeting. the issuer&#146;s directors will be elected at each annual meeting. if the class b shares constitute a majority at all times when the holders of all class b shares (assuming all voluntary exchanges of class a to class b shares are made) are collectively entitled to cast a majority of the total voting power: &#149; the issuer will rely on the &#147;controlled company&#148; exemption under the nasdaq rules which provides that if more than 50% of the voting power of a company listed on nasdaq is held by another company, the nasdaq listed company is not required to comply with certain director independence requirements that it would otherwise be subject to; &#149; there will be nine directors of the issuer; &#149; the holders of class b shares will be permitted to elect five of the issuer&#146;s directors separately as a class; and &#149; the quorum for action by the board of directors of the issuer will be a majority of the board of directors of the issuer, which majority must include at least four class b directors. the remaining four directors of the issuer will be class a directors nominated by a nominating committee consisting solely of class a directors then in office and elected by the holders of class a and class b shares voting together as a single class. harris will vote, or caused to be voted, all classes of capital stock or securities of the issuer owned by it or its affiliates entitled to vote generally in the election of class a directors, in favor of the election of the class a directors nominated by the nominating committee. in addition, at all times when the issuer is required to have directors who satisfy the independence requirements for directors serving on an audit committee as prescribed by the nasdaq rules, a sufficient number of the class a directors must satisfy those requirements so that there are enough class a directors, together with any class b directors who are required to or otherwise satisfy those independence requirements, to constitute an audit committee of the board of directors of the issuer which complies with the applicable nasdaq rule. page 7 of 17 pages if the class b shares constitutes less than a majority at all times when the holders of all class b shares (assuming all voluntary exchanges of class a to class b shares are made) are collectively entitled to cast less than a majority but equal to or greater than 10% of the total voting power, the holders of class b shares will be permitted to elect a number of class b directors equal to their percentage of total voting power times the total number of directors comprising the board of directors of the issuer (rounding down to the next whole number of directors). the remaining directors of the issuer will be class a directors nominated by a nominating committee meeting the requirements of the applicable nasdaq rules and elected by the holders class a and class b shares voting together as a single class. in addition, at all times when the issuer is required to have directors who satisfy the applicable independence requirements as prescribed by the nasdaq rules, a sufficient number of the class a directors must satisfy those requirements so that there are enough class a directors, together with any class b directors who are required to or otherwise satisfy those independence requirements, to cause the issuer to comply with the applicable nasdaq rules. removal and vacancies holders of class b shares will have the right to remove any class b director with or without cause at any time for any reason and will have the right to elect any successor director to fill the vacancies created by such removal. any vacancy created by the resignation, death or incapacity of a class b director will be filled by the other class b directors then in office and, if none, by the holders of class b shares. only holders of class a shares, voting separately as a class, will be permitted to remove the class a directors without cause or fill vacancies created by such removal, if not filled by the class a directors then in office. holders of class a and class b shares, voting together as a single class, will have the sole right to remove the class a directors for cause and the sole right to elect successor directors to fill any vacancy caused by such removal. to the extent harris owns any class a shares it has agreed that it will not vote those shares for the removal of any class a director without cause and will vote all of its class a shres for any individual nominated by the nominating committee to replace any class a director who has been removed with or without cause. committees at all times the audit, nominating and compensation committees of the board of directors of the issuer must comply with the applicable requirements under the nasdaq rules (after taking advantage of all available exemptions for controlled companies). voting requirements all actions of the board of directors of the issuer must be approved by a majority of a quorum. page 8 of 17 pages related party transactions harris and its affiliates are only permitted to enter into transactions with the issuer if the transaction is approved by a majority of the directors not elected by harris or is on terms no less favorable in any material respect to the issuer than those that could have been obtained by the issuer, taking into consideration the then prevailing facts and circumstances, if it had negotiated the transaction with an informed, unrelated third party. however, if a transaction has a fair market value of more than $5 million, it must be approved in advance by a majority of the class a directors. harris and the issuer have agreed that certain specified transactions relating to the payment of directors fees, employee benefits and other similar arrangements, indemnification arrangements and tax sharing arrangements between the issuer and any other entity with which the issuer files a consolidated tax return or with which the issuer is part of a consolidated group for tax purposes will not be subject to these restrictions. freedom of action and corporate opportunities subject to the terms of the non-competition agreement entered into by the issuer and harris on january 26, 2007 or other than opportunities offered to an individual who is a director or officer of both the issuer and harris in writing solely in that person&#146;s capacity as an officer or director of the issuer, harris and its affiliates will have the right to, and will have no fiduciary duty or other obligation to the issuer or any of the issuer&#146;s stockholders not to, take any of the following actions: &#149; engage in the same or similar activities or lines of business as the issuer or any of its subsidiaries or develop or market any products or services that compete, directly or indirectly, with those of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; &#149; invest or own any interest in, or develop a business relationship with, any entity or person engaged in the same or similar activities or lines of business as, or otherwise in competition with, the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; &#149; do business with any client or customer of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; or &#149; employ or otherwise engage any former officer or employee of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries. neither harris nor any of its affiliates nor any officer, director, employee or former employee of harris or any of its affiliates that is not currently an employee of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries (including any class b directors) will have any obligation, or be liable, to the issuer, any of its subsidiaries or any of their stockholders for, or arising out of, the conduct described in the preceding paragraph or the exercise of harris&#146; rights under the formation agreement or any related agreement, and none of these persons will be deemed to have acted (1) in bad faith, (2) in a manner inconsistent with the best interests of the issuer, any of its subsidiaries or any of their stockholders or (3) in a manner inconsistent with, or opposed to, any fiduciary duty owed by them to the issuer, any of its subsidiaries or any of their stockholders because of such conduct or the exercise of their rights as contemplated by the formation agreement and any related agreement. if harris or any of its subsidiaries or any of their directors, officers or employees, including any such individuals who are also directors, officers or employees of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, acquires knowledge of a potential opportunity, transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both harris or any of its subsidiaries and the issuer, then each harris person or entity will have the right to, and none of them shall have any fiduciary duty or other obligation not to, pursue such corporate opportunity for page 9 of 17 pages itself or to direct the corporate opportunity to any of its affiliates or to any third party. under the circumstances described in the immediately preceding sentence, no harris person or entity: &#149; will have any duty to communicate, offer or present the corporate opportunity to the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees; &#149; will have any liability to the issuer, any of its subsidiaries or any of their stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty, as a stockholder, director, officer or employee of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries or in any other capacity; or &#149; will be deemed to have acted (x) in bad faith, (y) in a manner inconsistent with the best interests of the issuer, any of its subsidiaries or any of their stockholders or (z) in a manner inconsistent with, or opposed to, any fiduciary duty owed by them to the issuer, any of its subsidiaries or any of their stockholders because any harris person or entity pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity for itself, directs the corporate opportunity to any of its affiliates or any third party, or does not communicate information regarding the corporate opportunity to the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees. however, a corporate opportunity offered to a person who is a director or officer of both the issuer and harris will belong to the issuer if the corporate opportunity is expressly offered to the person in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the issuer. standstill provision harris has agreed that, for two years following the completion of the proposed transactions, it will not acquire or dispose of any of its voting securities in the issuer with the following exceptions: &#149; pursuant to preemptive rights provided to the issuer further described below; &#149; unless approved in advance by a majority of the non-harris directors; and &#149; as a result of actions taken by the issuer that do not increase or decrease harris&#146; percentage of total voting power which harris and its affiliates are entitled to cast in respect of all classes of capital stock or securities of the issuer then outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of class a directors (including the holders of class b shares) beneficially owned by harris. in addition, harris has agreed that from the second to the fourth anniversary of the completion of the proposed transactions, it will not (1) beneficially own more than 80% of the voting power of the issuer without the prior approval of a majority of the non-harris directors or (2) transfer all or a portion of its interest in the issuer to a person if, following such transfer, that person would be entitled to cast a majority of the outstanding votes in an election of the directors of the issuer (other than an election of the class b directors) unless a majority of the non-harris directors approve such transfer in advance or the person purchasing harris&#146; interest in the issuer offers to acquire all the outstanding voting securities of the issuer at the same price and on the same terms as apply to the transfer from harris. there are no prohibitions or restrictions on any pro rata dividends or other pro rata distributions of the issuer voting securities to the stockholders of harris or any bona fide sale to the public of the issuer&#146;s securities pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act or a bona fide registered public offering. page 10 of 17 pages preemptive rights harris has the right to preserve its proportionate interest in the issuer by participating in any issuance of capital stock, but only when harris holds a majority of the total number of votes entitled to be cast generally in an election of the directors of the issuer (other than an election of the class b directors). if it elects to participate in the issuance, harris has the right to purchase up to that number of shares necessary to preserve its voting percentage at the same price on the same terms and conditions otherwise being offered by the issuer. the foregoing preemptive right does not apply to any issuances pursuant to any stock option, restricted stock or employee benefit plan of the issuer. however, at the end of each month, the issuer will give the holders of class b shares written notice of all of the proposed issuances pursuant to any stock option, restricted stock or employee benefit plan, and each holder of class b shares will have the right within 15 days of receiving such notice to purchase for cash up to a sufficient number of class b shares to prevent its total voting power from decreasing. the per share price for a purchase of class b shares pursuant to the monthly exercise notice will be the closing price of the class a shares on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the issuer received the notice of exercise. other provisions access to information; financial, accounting and disclosure matters the investor agreement also includes provisions relating to harris&#146; right to access the books and records of the issuer and its subsidiaries and perform examinations and audits. in addition, it sets out various covenants relating to the issuer&#146;s obligations to comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. and disclosure controls and procedures as required by the exchange act. the investor agreement also prescribes certain guidelines for the exchange of annual and quarterly accounting information between harris and the issuer to permit the companies to prepare their respective financial statements and other information. auditors the investor agreement provides that ernst &#038; young llp, the current independent registered public accounting firm of harris, will initially serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the issuer and its subsidiaries. the issuer will thereafter maintain as its auditor the same firm as harris, unless and until the audit committee of the issuer determines in good faith that it is required by law or that it is in the best interest of the stockholders of the issuer to appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm than that appointed by harris as harris&#146; independent registered public accounting firm. option exercise if the issuer determines to use the proceeds from the exercise of any options to acquire the issuer&#146;s common stock to repurchase class a shares in the market at the then prevailing market price, whether or not at the request of harris, that determination or repurchase will not be deemed to be subject to the related party transaction provisions of the investor agreement or a breach by harris or any class b director of any duty or obligation they may have to the issuer or its stockholders. page 11 of 17 pages termination the investor agreement terminates the first time at which the total voting power of all classes of capital stock or securities of the issuer then outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of class a directors (including the holders of class b shares) owned by harris or its affiliates represent less than 10% of the total voting power. assignment harris is permitted to assign all of its rights and obligations under the investor agreement to any person to whom it transfers all of the ownership interests in the issuer then owned by harris and its affiliates if the transferee delivers a written undertaking to the issuer in which such person expressly assumes all of harris&#146; obligations under the investor agreement. except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no party may assign the investor agreement or any rights, benefits, obligations or remedies thereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, except that no such consent shall be required for a transfer by operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation of a party. subsidiaries for purposes of the investor agreement, neither the issuer nor any of its subsidiaries are deemed to be a subsidiary or affiliate of harris. registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement between harris and the issuer contains the following terms, among others: &#149; securities that may be registered under the agreement include (1) class a and class b shares or other securities acquired by harris from the issuer, (2) any securities issued or distributed regarding, or in exchange for, any such class a or class b shares or securities (whether directly or indirectly or in one or a series of transactions) pursuant to any reclassification, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other transaction or procedure and (3) any securities issued or distributed regarding, or in exchange for, any securities described in clause (2) or this clause (3) (whether directly or indirectly or in one or a series of transactions) pursuant to any reclassification, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other transaction or procedure, other than, in the case of each of clauses (1), (2) and (3), any
