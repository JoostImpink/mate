and subject to the conditions contained in the registration rights agreements, the purchaser and the manager have certain demand and &#147;piggyback&#148; registration rights with respect to their special series a shares and the common shares into which their special series a shares convert (&#147;registrable securities&#148;). in addition, if the company becomes eligible to use a form s-3 registration statement, then the purchaser and the manager may, subject to certain conditions, require the company to effect a shelf registration for their registrable securities. 8 8 this description of the registration rights agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms of the registration rights agreements, which are attached as exhibits 10.16 and 10.17 to this current report and incorporated herein by reference. tax benefits preservation plan on march 5, 2010, the board delegated to the rights plan evaluation committee (the &#147;committee&#148;) the full power and authority of the board to consider and declare if it so deems advisable a distribution of one series b special share purchase right (a &#147;right&#148;) for each common share, convertible community reinvestment act preferred share (the &#147;ccra preferred shares&#148;), series a convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares (the &#147;series a cra preferred shares&#148;), special preferred voting shares (the &#147;special preferred voting shares&#148;), and 15 rights for each special series a share of the company outstanding at the close of business on or after the date of the committee&#146;s resolution approving the distribution. the committee has declared such distribution in respect of all such shares as of march 22, 2010 (the &#147;record date&#148;). the special series a shares, the common shares, the ccra preferred shares, the series a cra preferred shares and the special preferred voting shares are collectively referred to herein as the &#147;existing shares.&#148; as long as the rights are attached to the existing shares, the company will issue one right (subject to adjustment) with each new common share, cra share, series a cra share and special preferred voting share, and 15 rights with each new special series a share issued prior to the distribution date or the expiration date (as defined below) so that all such shares will have attached rights. when exercisable, each right will entitle the registered holder to purchase from the company one one-millionth of a series b special share (the &#147;series b shares&#148;) at a price of $0.66 per one one-millionth of a series b share, subject to adjustment (the &#147;purchase price&#148;). the description and terms of the rights are set forth in a tax benefits preservation plan, dated as of march 5, 2010, as the same may be amended from time to time (the &#147;rights agreement&#148;), between the company and computershare trust company, n.a., a federally chartered trust company (the &#147;rights agent&#148;). by adopting the rights agreement, the board is seeking to protect the company&#146;s ability to carry forward its net operating losses and certain other tax attributes (collectively, the &#147;nols&#148;). the company has experienced and may continue to experience substantial net operating losses, and for federal and state income tax purposes, the company may &#147;carry forward&#148; net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset current and future taxable income, which will reduce federal and state income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. these federal and state nols can be a valuable asset of the company, which may inure to the benefit of the company and it shareholders. however, if the company experiences an &#147;ownership change&#148;, as defined in section 382 of the code, its ability to use the nols could be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the nols could be substantially delayed, which would significantly impair the value of the company&#146;s nol asset. generally, an &#147;ownership change&#148; occurs if the percentage of the shares of beneficial interest in the company ( i.e. , the existing shares) owned by one or more &#147;five percent shareholders&#148; increases by more than fifty percentage points over the lowest percentage of shares of beneficial interest owned by such shareholder at any time during the prior three-year period or, if sooner, since the last &#147;ownership change&#148; experienced by the company. therefore, an nol rights agreement with a 5% &#147;trigger&#148; threshold is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or entity acquiring 5% or more of the outstanding existing shares without the prior approval of the board. this would protect the company&#146;s nol asset because changes in ownership by a person or entity owning less than 5% of the existing shares are not included in the calculation of &#147;ownership change&#148; for purposes of section 382 of the code. 9 9 until the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth business day following a public announcement that a person, entity or group of affiliated or associated persons or entities has become a five percent (5%) shareholder (as defined in the rights agreement) (an &#147;acquiring person&#148;) or (ii) ten business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the board prior to such time as any person, entity or group of affiliated persons or entities becomes an acquiring person) following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in a person becoming an acquiring person (the earlier of (i) and (ii) being called the &#147;distribution date&#148;), the rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the certificates evidencing existing shares outstanding as of the record date, by such certificate (or, with respect to any existing shares held in book entry form, by notation in book entry) together with a copy of a summary of such rights. the rights agreement provides that any person or entity who otherwise would be a five percent 5(%) shareholder on the date the rights agreement was adopted, together with any affiliates and associates of that person or entity (each an &#147;existing holder&#148;), shall not be deemed to be an &#147;acquiring person&#148; for purposes of the rights agreement unless such holder increases its &#147;percentage stock ownership&#148; by more than one-quarter of one percentage point over such holder&#146;s lowest percentage stock ownership on or after the consummation of the relevant transaction, subject to certain exceptions for increases due to repurchases or redemptions, stock dividends, stock splits and the like. as the rights agreement was not in place at the time of the transactions, the purchaser did not become an acquiring person as a result of the transactions. the rights agreement includes a procedure whereby the board will consider requests to exempt certain proposed acquisitions of existing shares from the applicable ownership trigger if the board determines that the requested acquisition will not jeopardize or endanger the availability of the nols to the company. the rights agreement provides that until the distribution date (or earlier redemption, exchange, termination or expiration of the rights), the rights will be transferred with and only with the existing shares. until the distribution date (or earlier redemption, exchange, termination or expiration of the rights), certificates for new existing shares (and ownership statements in respect of uncertificated shares) issued after the close of business on the record date upon transfer or new issuance of the existing shares will contain a notation incorporating the rights agreement by reference. until the distribution date (or earlier redemption, exchange, termination or expiration of the rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for existing shares or any book entry shares, with or without such notation, notice or a copy of a summary of such rights, will also constitute the transfer of the rights associated with the existing shares represented by such certificate or uncertificated shares. as soon as practicable following the distribution date, separate certificates evidencing rights (the &#147;right certificates&#148;) will be mailed to the holders of record of existing shares as of the close of business on the distribution date and such separate right certificates alone will evidence the rights. the rights are not exercisable until the distribution date. the rights will expire thirty six (36) months and one day after the date of the rights agreement (the &#147;final expiration date&#148;), subject to the company&#146;s right to extend such date, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the company or terminated. each series b share purchasable upon the exercise of the rights will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly distribution payment of the greater of (a) $1.00 per share, or (b) an aggregate distribution of 1,000,000 times the distribution, if any, declared per common share. in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, the holders of series b shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $10.00 per share (plus any accrued but unpaid distributions), provided that such holders of series b shares will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 1,000,000 times the payment made per common share. each series b share will have 1,000,000 votes and will vote together with the shares of beneficial interest of the company. finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of beneficial interest are exchanged, each series b share will be entitled to receive 1,000,000 times the amount received per common share. series b shares will not be redeemable. these rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions. because of the nature of the series b share&#146;s distribution, liquidation and voting rights, the value of one one-millionth of a series b share purchasable upon exercise of each right should approximate the value of one common share. 10 10 the purchase price payable, and the number of series b shares or other shares of beneficial interest in the company or property of the company issuable, upon the exercise of the rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution. in general, at any time after a person or entity becomes an acquiring person, the board may cause the company to exchange the rights (other than rights owned by an acquiring person which will have become void), in whole or in part, for series b shares (or common shares or special shares) at an exchange rate of one one-millionth of a series b share (subject to adjustment) for each right. no adjustment in the purchase price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such purchase price. no fractional series b shares or existing shares will be issued (other than fractions of series b shares which are integral multiples of one one-millionth of a series b share, which may, at the election of the company, be evidenced by depository receipts), and in lieu thereof, a payment in cash will be made based on the market price of the series b shares or existing shares on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise. the rights may be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.00001 per right (the &#147;redemption price&#148;) by the board at any time prior to the time that an acquiring person has become such. the redemption of the rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the board in its sole discretion may establish. immediately upon any redemption of the rights, the right to exercise the rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of rights will be to receive the redemption price. until a right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a shareholder of the company beyond those as an existing shareholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive distribution. any of the provisions of the rights agreement may be amended by the board for so long as the rights are then redeemable, and after the rights are no longer redeemable, the company may amend or supplement the rights agreement in any manner that does not adversely affect, in any material way, the interests of the holders of the rights (other than an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate of an acquiring person). this description of the rights agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms of the rights agreement, which is attached as exhibit

amendment no. 1 thereto, dated as of september 20, 2005, as further amended by amendment no. 2 thereto, dated as of november 30, 2005, as further amended by amendment no. 3 thereto, dated as of june 13, 2006, and as further amended by amendment no. 4 thereto, dated as of april 2, 2007 (the &#147; trust agreement &#148;). pursuant to the authority expressly vested in the board of trustees of the company (the &#147; board &#148;) by the trust agreement, the board (i) duly adopted on january 17, 2008, resolutions providing for the creation of a class of preferred shares of the company, with substantially (x) the designations, powers, preferences, (y) the relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and (z) the qualifications, limitations or restrictions set forth below (in addition to those set forth in the trust agreement) and (ii) formed a rights offering committee of the board (the &#147; rights offering committee &#148;) and delegated to the rights offering committee the authority to make changes to the form of certificate of designation with respect to such class of preferred shares. the rights offering committee, pursuant to resolutions duly adopted on january 25, 2008, approved the adoption of a certificate of designation of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, series a-1 (the &#147; 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares ) of the company, (the &#147; original certificate of designation &#148;). the board, by resolution duly adopted on march 5, 2010, approved the amendment and restatement of the original certificate of

(the &#147; effective date &#148;). capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall for all purposes of this amended and restated certificate of designation have the respective meaning as specified by the trust agreement. recitals whereas, the company has previously redeemed a portion of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares originally issued to related special assets llc, a delaware limited liability company (&#147; related &#148;) with the net proceeds received by the company from a rights offering to holders of certain of the company&#146;s securities (the &#147; rights offering &#148;); whereas , the company, among others, has entered into a settlement agreement dated april 8, 2009 (the &#147; settlement agreement &#148;) in connection with the settlement of carfagno v. schnitzer, 08-cv-912(sas) (s.d.n.y.) and other related lawsuits (the &#147; settlement &#148;); and whereas , pursuant to the settlement agreement, related, the holder of at least a majority of the outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, agreed to waive (the &#147; waiver &#148;) certain of its rights under the original certificate of designation with respect to the dividend rate and conversion price for the10,843,492 of the company&#146;s 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares that related holds (the &#147; related shares &#148;); and whereas, on may 18, 2009, the court having jurisdiction over the settlement (the &#147; court &#148;) issued its order and final judgment (the &#147;order&#148;) approving the settlement, including the waiver, but such order is not effective until the dismissal of the actions off v. ross, et al, civ. a. no. 3468-vcp (del. ch.) and ciszerk v. ross, civ. a. no. 3511-vcp (del. ch.) (the &#147; dismissal &#148;); and whereas, the board duly approved and adopted resolutions on march 5, 2010, approving the amendment of the original certificate of designation in the form of this amended and restated certificate of designation and the terms hereof; and whereas, in accordance with section 5.c. of the original certificate of designation, related, as the holder of at least a majority of the outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, consented to the amendment of the original certificate of designation in the form of this amended and restated certificate of designation pursuant to the amendment agreement, dated march 5, 2010 entered into between the company and related; and whereas, as of the date hereof, the dismissal has not yet become effective but related and the company nonetheless wish to implement the waiver and to adopt this amended and restated certificate of designation. now, therefore, the original certificate of designation is hereby amended and restated in its entirety effective as of the effective date, as follows: 1. designation and amount . the shares of such class of preferred shares shall be designated &#147;11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, series a-1&#148; (the &#147; 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares ,&#148; ) and, subject to the trust agreement, the number of shares constituting such class shall be as determined from time to time by the board. the company may, from time to time, issue additional 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and has issued, and may from time to time issue, other securities that are on parity with the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares with respect to the payment of distributions and rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, which includes, but is not limited to, additional already issued and currently outstanding 4.40% cumulative perpetual convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares, series a-1 (the &#147; cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares &#148;). the additional 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares will be treated as a single class and series for all purposes of this amended and restated certificate of designation, including, without limitation, for purposes of voting, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. a-2 2. distributions, earnings and tax allocations . a. distributions . (i) except as set forth in clause (ii) below and section 2.b. and subject to the provisions of 2.g, the company shall pay, when, as and if, declared, out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative preferential cash distributions on each 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share at the annual rate of 11.0% (equivalent initially to $1.287 per share per year), as may be adjusted pursuant to section 2.g, computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months (such annual rate, the &#147; dividend rate &#148;), based on the initial liquidation amount of $11.70 per share (such per share amount, as adjusted, the &#147; liquidation preference &#148;). the initial distribution and any distribution payable on 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares for any other partial distribution period will be prorated for the period of time the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are outstanding during the applicable period. distributions on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall be cumulative from the date of issuance (the &#147; issue date &#148;), shall be payable for each calendar quarter in arrears on the following dates of each year: january 31, april 30, july 31 and october 31 and any accumulated and unpaid distribution will be added to the liquidation preference on each distribution payment date if not declared and paid in cash on such distribution payment date, such that such accumulated and unpaid distributions will effectively compound each quarter; provided, however, that if any such date is not a business day, the applicable distribution will be made on the next succeeding business day in respect of the immediately preceding calendar quarter ending december 31, march 31, june 30, and september 30, respectively (each such date, a &#147; distribution payment date &#148;). ii. notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this amended and restated certificate of designation (including section 2.a.i.), on and effective as of the effective date, the &#147;dividend rate,&#148; solely with respect to each of the related shares, shall be an annual rate of 9.5% (equivalent initially to $1.1115 per share per year), as may be adjusted pursuant to section 2.g, rather than the dividend rate set forth in section 2.a..i. the provisions of this section 2.a.ii. shall apply to related and any subsequent holder of the related shares. b. initial distribution . pursuant to the terms of section 2.a., the initial quarterly distribution payable on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall be equal to the quarterly distribution otherwise payable on such shares, prorated for the period from the date of issuance of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to the end of the calendar quarter in which the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares were issued. c. record date . distributions will be payable to holders of record of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares as they appear in the company&#146;s transfer records at the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the last day of the calendar quarter (whether or not a business day) prior to the applicable distribution payment date or such other date designated by the board for the payment of distributions that is not more than 31 nor less than 10 days prior to such distribution payment date (each, a &#147; distribution record date &#148;). a-3 d. distribution priorities . i. if any 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are outstanding, except as permitted in the next sentence, no full distributions shall be declared, paid or set apart for payment on any of the company&#146;s shares ranking, as to the payment of distributions or rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up on a parity with or junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares for any period unless full cumulative distributions have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof irrevocably set apart for such payment, on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares for all past distribution periods and the then current distribution period. when distributions are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so irrevocably set apart) upon the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and any other preferred shares ranking, as to distributions, on a parity with the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, including, without limitation, the cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares, all distributions declared upon the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and such other preferred shares, including, without limitation, the cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares, shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of distributions declared for each 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share and each such other preferred shares, including, without limitation, the cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares, shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated and unpaid distributions for each 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share and such other preferred shares (which shall not include any accumulation in respect of unpaid distributions for prior distribution periods if such other preferred shares are not entitled to a cumulative distribution) bear to each other. ii. except as provided herein, including the payment of distributions on preferred shares ranking, as to distributions, on a parity with the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares as provided in the second sentence of section 2.d.i., unless full cumulative distributions on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof irrevocably set apart for payment for all past distribution periods and the then current distribution period, no distributions (other than in any of the company&#146;s shares ranking, as to distributions and rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution and winding up, junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment, nor shall any other distribution be made, upon any of the company&#146;s shares ranking, as to distributions or rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution and winding up, on a parity with or junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, nor shall any of the company&#146;s shares ranking, as to the payment of distributions or rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, on a parity with or junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (nor shall any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the company or any of the company&#146;s affiliates (except by conversion into or exchange for other of the company&#146;s shares ranking, as to the payment of distributions and rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares). e. accumulated distributions . distributions on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares will accumulate, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment thereof and whether or not they are declared, and accumulated but unpaid distributions will accumulate as of the distribution payment date on which they first become payable. any distribution payment made on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid distribution due with respect to such shares that remains payable at the time of such distribution payment. a-4 f. compliance with law . no distributions on the convertible preferred shares will be authorized by the board or paid or set apart for payment if such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment would violate any of the company&#146;s agreements or instruments, including, without limitation, the credit agreement (as defined below), as the same may from time to time be amended, or is restricted or prohibited by law. g. increase in dividend rate . if the company fails to pay the redemption price on any redemption date (as defined below), then the dividend rate shall increase commencing on such redemption date on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares by 4.00% until such date that the redemption price is paid or funds sufficient for the payment of such redemption price are irrevocably deposited in trust by the company pursuant to section 3 below. 3. redemption . a. call redemption . except as provided in this section 3.a., the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are not redeemable by the company at any time prior to the final redemption date (as defined below). unless previously redeemed or converted as herein provided, the company will redeem all 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares then outstanding at a per share amount equal to 100% of the liquidation preference plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid distributions not included in the liquidation preference to, but excluding, the final redemption date, on january, 25, 2018 (the &#147; final redemption date &#148;). the company may redeem the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, in whole or in part, at a price per share equal to 100% of the liquidation preference plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid distributions not included in the liquidation preference to the redemption date at any time on or after january 31, 2013; provided that (a) the closing sale price of the common shares multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid distributions not included in the liquidation preference for 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending after january 31, 2013 and (b) the company has paid all accumulated and unpaid distributions on the distribution payment date immediately preceding such redemption date. &#147; closing sale price &#148; means for all purposes of this amended and restated certificate of designation, with respect to the common shares, on any date, the last reported per share sale price (or, if no last sale price is reported, the average of the last bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on such date as reported in composite transactions for the principal united states securities exchange on which the common shares are then listed, or if the common shares are not then listed on a united states national or regional exchange, as reported on the principal over-the-counter market on which the common shares are then traded or quoted. a-5 &#147; trading day &#148; means for all purposes of this amended and restated certificate of designation, (i) if the common shares are listed or admitted for trading on any national or regional securities exchange, days on which such national or regional securities exchange is

are traded regular way in the over-the-counter market and for which a closing bid and a closing asked price for the common shares are available. b. source of financing . redemptions of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares may be financed using funds from any source. c. notice of redemption . notice of redemption will be mailed not less than 20 nor more than 60 days prior to the

such shares, stating (i) the redemption date, (ii) the redemption price, (iii) the number of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to be redeemed (and, if fewer than all the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder), (iv) the place(s) where the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are to be surrendered for payment, (v) that distributions on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date and (vi) the date upon which the holder&#146;s conversion rights, if any, as to such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall terminate. if fewer than all of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares outstanding are to be redeemed, the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to be redeemed will be determined pro rata or by lot or in such other manner as prescribed by the board. holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares may continue to convert their 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares into common shares after receiving notice of redemption through the close of business on the redemption date in accordance with the provisions of section 6 hereof. d. mechanics of redemption . on or after a redemption date, each applicable holder of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to be redeemed must present and surrender the certificate representing such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to the company at the place designated in the applicable notice, duly endorsed, and thereupon the company shall pay or cause to be paid the redemption price of such shares to or on the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate as the owner thereof, and each certificate so surrendered will thereafter be canceled. if fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate are to be redeemed, the company shall issue a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares. a holder may notify the company that its certificate or certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and, upon execution of an agreement satisfactory to the company to indemnify the company for any loss incurred by it in connection with such lost certificate or certificates or an indemnity bond (in the company&#146;s sole discretion), and assuming such holder&#146;s a-6 compliance with the other provisions of this section 3.d, such holder shall be entitled to receive the amounts contemplated by this section 3.d. from and after such redemption date (unless the company defaults in payment of the redemption price), all distributions on 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares called for redemption will cease to accumulate and all rights of the holders thereof, except the right to receive the redemption price thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date), will cease and terminate and such shares may not thereafter be transferred (except with the company&#146;s consent) in the company&#146;s transfer records, and such shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. e. deposit of redemption price . at the company&#146;s election, the company may, prior to the redemption date, irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid distributions not included in the liquidation preference) of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares so called for redemption in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust company, in which case the redemption notice to holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to be redeemed will (i) state the date of such deposit, (ii) specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price and (iii) require such holders to surrender the certificates representing such shares at such place on or about, but not later than, the redemption date against payment of the redemption price (including all accumulated and unpaid distributions to such redemption date). any moneys so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares at the end of two years after the redemption date will be returned by such bank or trust company to the company. f. voting rights upon redemption/conversion . the voting rights granted to the holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares (see section 5 hereof) will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required is effected, all outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares have been converted, redeemed or called for redemption and sufficient funds shall have been irrevocably deposited in trust to effect such redemption. g. payment of cumulative distributions prior to redemption. notwithstanding anything in this section 3 to the contrary, unless full cumulative distributions on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and sum sufficient for the payment thereof irrevocably set apart for payment for all past distribution periods and the then current distribution period, no 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares will be redeemed unless all outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are simultaneously redeemed, provided, however, that the foregoing will not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the company of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares. in addition, unless full cumulative distributions on all outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof irrevocably set apart for payment for all past distributions periods and the then current distribution period, the company may not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares or any of the company&#146;s shares ranking, as to the payment of distributions or rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution a-7 or winding up on a parity with or junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares (except by conversion into or exchange for other of the company&#146;s shares ranking, as to distributions and rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares) provided, however, that the foregoing will not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the company of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares. h. repurchase at option of holder upon a fundamental change . i. if a fundamental change (as defined below) occurs at any time prior to the final redemption date, then each holder of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall have the right, at such holder&#146;s option, to require the company to repurchase all of such holder&#146;s 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, or any portion thereof, for cash on a date designated by the company (the &#147; fundamental change repurchase date &#148;) that is not less than twenty (20) nor more than thirty (30) days after the date of the fundamental change notice (as defined below) in respect of such fundamental change at a repurchase price per share equal to 100% of the liquidation preference of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to be repurchased, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid distributions not included in the liquidation preference up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. notwithstanding the foregoing, if a fundamental change repurchase date is after a distribution record date but on or prior to the corresponding distribution payment date, the company will pay the full amount of accumulated and unpaid distributions on such distribution payment date to the holder of record at the close of business on the corresponding distribution record date. notwithstanding the foregoing, no 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares may be surrendered for repurchase pursuant to this section 3.h in connection with a merger, consolidation, conversion or other transaction effected solely for the purpose of changing the company&#146;s jurisdiction of organization to any other state within the united states. ii. before the fifteenth (15th) day after the occurrence of a fundamental change, the company shall mail or cause to be mailed to all holders of record on the date of the fundamental change a notice (the &#147; fundamental change notice &#148;) of the occurrence of such fundamental change, of the repurchase right at the option of the holders arising as a result thereof and the fundamental change conversion date (as defined below). each fundamental change notice shall specify (a) the circumstances constituting the fundamental change, (b) the fundamental change repurchase date, (c) that; if the holder desires to exercise its repurchase right pursuant to this section 3.h, the holder must do so on or prior to the close of business on the fundamental change repurchase date (the &#147; fundamental change expiration time &#148;), (d) that the holder shall have the right to withdraw any 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares surrendered prior to the fundamental change expiration time, (e) if the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are then convertible, that 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares as to which an option of holder to elect repurchase (as hereinafter defined) has been given may be converted only if the option of holder to elect repurchase is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement, (f) a description of the procedure that a holder must follow to exercise such repurchase right and to withdraw any surrendered 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, (g) the place or places where the holder is to surrender such holder&#146;s 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, (h) the amount of accumulated and unpaid distributions in respect of such holder&#146;s 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to the fundamental change repurchase date and (i) the cusip number or numbers of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares (if then generally in use). a-8 no failure of the company to give the foregoing notices and no defect therein shall limit the holders&#146; repurchase rights or affect the validity of the proceedings for the repurchase of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares pursuant to this section 3.h. iii. repurchases of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares under this section 3.h shall be made, at the option of the holder thereof, upon delivery to the company, prior to the fundamental change expiration time, at the address specified in the applicable fundamental change notice by a holder of a duly completed and executed notice (the &#147; option of holder to elect repurchase &#148;) in the form set forth on the reverse of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share. the company shall not be required to purchase from any holder, fractions of an 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any holder delivering to the company the option of holder to elect repurchase contemplated by this section 3.h shall have the right to withdraw such option of holder to elect repurchase at any time prior to the fundamental change expiration time by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to the company in accordance with section 3.h.iv below. 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares in respect of which an option of holder to elect repurchase has been given by the holder thereof may not be converted pursuant to section 6 hereof on or after the date of the delivery of such option of holder to elect repurchase unless such option of holder to elect repurchase has first been validly withdrawn. for a 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share to be so repurchased at the option of the holder, the company must receive at the address specified in the fundamental change notice a share certificate, if any, in respect of such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share duly endorsed for transfer in favor of the company (or an affidavit of lost share certificate in respect thereof together with either, at the option of the company in its sole discretion, an indemnity agreement or indemnity bond), together with the form entitled &#147;option of holder to elect repurchase&#148; on the reverse thereof duly completed and such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share duly endorsed for transfer, on or before the fundamental change expiration time. all questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share for repurchase shall be determined by the company, the determination of which shall be final and binding absent manifest error. a-9 iv. an option of holder to elect repurchase may be withdrawn by means of a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the address specified in the fundamental change notice in accordance with the option of holder to elect repurchase at any time prior to the fundamental change expiration time, specifying: a. the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares with respect to which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted; b. the certificate number, if any, of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted; and c. the amount of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, if any, that remain subject to the original option of holder to elect repurchase. v. at the company&#146;s election, the company may, prior to the fundamental change repurchase date, irrevocably deposit an amount of money sufficient to repurchase all the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to be repurchased on the fundamental change repurchase date in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust company, in which case the fundamental change notice will (i) state the date of such deposit, (ii) specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the offer to purchase and (iii) require such holders to surrender the certificates representing such shares at such place on or about, but not later than, the fundamental change repurchase date against payment of the purchase price therefor (including all accumulated and unpaid distributions to such fundamental change repurchase date). any moneys so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares at the end of two years after the fundamental change repurchase date will be returned by such bank or trust company to the company. if on the business day immediately following the fundamental change repurchase date, the company or such other bank or trust company, holds money sufficient to repurchase all of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares that are to be purchased as of the fundamental change repurchase date, then, on and after such date, (i) such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares will cease to be outstanding, (ii) distribution on such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares will cease to accumulate, and (iii) all other rights of the holders of such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares will terminate, other than the right to receive the repurchase price upon delivery of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares in accordance with this section 3.h. vi. the company will comply with the requirements of rule 13e-4, rule 14e-1 and any other tender offer rules under the united states securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the &#147; exchange act &#148;), to the extent applicable, and file a schedule to or any other required schedule or form under the exchange act to the extent then applicable in connection with the repurchase rights of the holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares pursuant to this section 3.h in the event of a fundamental change. to the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this amended and restated certificate of designation governing an offer to purchase upon a fundamental change, the company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the provisions of this amended and restated certificate of designation by virtue of such compliance. a-10 vii. a &#147; fundamental change &#148; means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the sale, lease or transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the company&#146;s assets (determined on a consolidated basis) to any person or group (as such term is used in section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act), (b) the adoption of a plan the consummation of which would result in the company&#146;s liquidation or dissolution, (c) the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by any person or group (as such term is used in section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act), of beneficial ownership (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the exchange act) of more than 50% of the aggregate voting power of the company&#146;s voting shares, (d) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period comprised the board (together with any new trustees whose election by such board or whose nomination for election by the company&#146;s shareholders was approved by a vote of 66 2/3% of the company&#146;s trustees then still in office who were either trustees at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the board then in office, or (e) the common shares cease to be listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the-counter market in the united states. viii. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any fundamental change would constitute the payment of a distribution or a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, then the payment by the company to any holder of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares upon a fundamental change shall be subject to the rights of all holders of all other of the company&#146;s shares ranking on parity with the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares as to the payment of distributions or rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, to receive payment on parity with the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares. i. compliance with law . notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no redemption or repurchase pursuant to this section 3 will be made by the company if such redemption or repurchase is restricted or prohibited by law or would violate any of the company&#146;s agreements or instruments, including, without limitation, the credit agreement (as defined below), as the same may from time to time be amended. 4. liquidation, dissolution or winding up . a. payment of distributions and rights . subject to the rights of any equity securities ranking on parity with, or senior to, the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, including, without limitation, the cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares, and the then existing and future liabilities, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, the holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall be entitled to the liquidation preference per such share plus any accrued and unpaid distributions on such shares not otherwise included in the liquidation preference. with respect to the payment of distributions and rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall rank: (i) senior to (a) the common shares; (b) the convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares of the company and a-11 series a convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares of the company; and (c) all other equity securities issued by the company the terms of which acknowledge such ranking; (ii) on a parity with (a) the cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares; and (b) all other equity securities the terms of which acknowledge such ranking; and (iii) junior to (a) all equity securities issued by the company whose terms specifically provide that they rank senior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares; and (b) the payment of the company&#146;s then existing and future liabilities (including the company&#146;s indebtedness). the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall not be entitled to cra credits. &#147; cra credits &#148; are an allocation of the value of any assets owned directly or indirectly by the company which a cumulative perpetual convertible cra shareholder or holder of a parity security may be able to report under the &#147;investment test&#148; promulgated under the community reinvestment act of 1977, as amended from time to time and as affected by the gramm-leach-bliley act, enacted on november 12, 1999 (the &#147; cra &#148;). b. additional issuances . the company may issue, without consent of the holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares (&#147; cumulative convertible preferred shareholders &#148;): (i) additional common shares; (ii) securities that rank on parity with or junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares with respect to payment of distributions and rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, including, without limitation, 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares; and (iii) additional securities which rank senior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares solely with respect to cra credit allocations and not with respect to payment of distributions and rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up; and (iv) subject to section 5.c.ii, additional indebtedness. 5. voting rights . a. general . to the extent not prohibited by the rules of the nyse and any other national or regional securities exchange or system of automated dissemination of quotation of securities prices in the united states on which the common shares are then traded or quoted, the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall be entitled to vote together with the holders of common shares as a single class (together with any other securities issued by the company that are entitled to vote together with the common shares with respect to the matter to be voted upon) on all matters that holders of common shares are entitled to vote upon, with each 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share entitled to such number of votes as are equal to the number of whole common shares such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share would be convertible into as of the record date for any such vote of common shares regardless of whether the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are then so convertible. b. outstanding distributions/redemption payment . whenever (i) distributions on any 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods or (ii) the company fails to pay the redemption price on any redemption date, in each case, subject to the provisions of and in accordance with the trust agreement, the holders of a majority of the outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and the holders of any other parity preferred shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred a-12 and are exercisable, including, but not limited to, the cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares, if applicable (voting together as a single class with all holders of other parity preferred shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to nominate and elect two trustees to the board for a one-year term. in exercising their rights to nominate and elect such trustees under this section 5.b., the holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall comply with all requirements as to the composition of the board set forth in the trust agreement, including any certificates of designation, and the company bylaws. during the period of any such arrearage, the board shall increase the size of the board by two members to accommodate the two additional trustees. upon the cure of such arrearage, the two additional trustees shall immediately cease to be trustees and the size of the board shall be reduced by two members. such election shall be held at a special meeting of such shareholders and at each subsequent annual meeting until all arrearages and the distributions on the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and such other preferred shares have been fully paid or a sum sufficient for the full payment thereof has been irrevocably set apart. vacancies for trustees elected by holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and such other preferred shares shall be filled by the remaining trustee so elected then in office or, if there is no such remaining trustee, by the holders of a majority of the outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and such other preferred shares voting together as a single class. a trustee elected by the holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and such other preferred shares may be removed with or without cause only by the holders of a majority of the outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and such other preferred shares voting together as a single class. trustees elected by the holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and such other preferred shares shall not be divided into the classes of the board and the term of office of all trustees elected by the holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares and such other preferred shares will terminate immediately upon the termination of the rights of the holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to vote for trustees and upon such termination the total number of trustees constituting the entire board will automatically be reduced by two. in accordance with the provisions of this section 5.b., holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall be entitled to one vote per share, provided that if one or more additional classes of parity preferred shares is entitled to vote along together with the holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, including, without limitation, the cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares, if applicable, then the holders of each class of shares will have voting rights proportional to the relative amounts of liquidation preference and accumulated and unpaid distributions outstanding in respect of each class. c. required consent . so long as any 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares remain outstanding, the company may not, i. without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting, (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of the company&#146;s shares ranking, with respect to the payment of distributions or rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, senior to 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, or reclassify any authorized shares into such shares, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible or exchangeable into, or evidencing the right to purchase any, such shares or (ii) amend, alter or a-13 repeal the provisions of the trust agreement or the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, whether by merger, conversion or consolidation (an &#147; event &#148;) or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares or the holders thereof; provided, however, with respect to the occurrence of any of the events set forth in (ii) above, so long as 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares remain outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that, upon the occurrence of an event, the company may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of any such event will not be deemed to materially adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares or the holders thereof; and provided, further, that (x) any increase in the amount of the authorized preferred shares or the creation or issuance of any other preferred shares, or (y) any increase in the amount of authorized 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares or cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares, in each case ranking, as to payment of distributions or rights upon the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, on a parity with or junior to the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, will not be deemed to materially adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers; and ii. without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting, incur any indebtedness or issue any capital stock, the incurrence or issuance of which would cause a default in the &#147; consolidated ebitda to fixed charges ratio &#148; covenant contained in section 10.15 of the revolving credit and term loan agreement, dated as of december 27, 2007, by and among the company and centerline capital group inc., as borrowers named therein, and certain entities named therein as guarantors, bank of america, n.a. and other entities party thereto from time to time as lenders, and bank of america, n.a., as swingline lender and as administrative agent on behalf of the lenders, as the same may be amended from time to time (the &#147; credit agreement &#148;), assuming for purposes of this section 5.c.ii that the ratio of consolidated ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) to fixed charges (as defined in the credit agreement) required to be maintained is measured for the period of the last 12 months then ending and is required to be equal to or greater than 1.5 to 1.0. 6. conversion . a. optional right to convert; conversion formula; automatic conversion . i. to the extent permitted by the rules of the nyse and any other national or regional securities exchange or system of automated dissemination of quotation of securities prices in the united states on which the common shares are then traded or quoted and upon compliance with the provisions of this section 6 but subject to the provisions of clause (ii) below, 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares may be converted into common shares at the cumulative convertible preferred shareholder&#146;s option in whole or in part at any time after the date hereof initially at a conversion rate per $11.70 liquidation preference equal to 1.0884 (representing the quotient of 1.0884 obtained by dividing $11.70 by $10.75) (the &#147; conversion rate &#148;), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $10.75 per common share (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of this section 6). a-14 ii. notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this amended and restated certificate of designation (including, without limitation, section 6.a.i.), on and effective as of the effective date, the &#147;conversion rate&#148;, solely with respect to each of the related shares, shall be at a conversion rate per $11.70 liquidation preference equal to 0.9474 (representing the quotient of 0.9474 obtained by dividing $11.70 by $12.35), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $12.35 per common share (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of section 6) rather than the conversion rate set forth in section 6.a.i. in addition, all provisions of this amended and restated certificate of designation, including without limitation, the following sections (and applicable defined terms) of this amended and restated certificate of designation, solely with respect to the related shares, shall be hereby modified, as necessary, to reflect an equivalent formulation based on a $12.35 conversion price, if a conversion rate adjustment is otherwise required pursuant to section 6 of this amended and restated certificate of designation: (i) 6.c.; (ii) sections 6.d.i, 6.d.ii and 6.d.iii.: &#147;additional shares&#148;; (iii) section 6.d.iii.: &#147;cap price&#148; and &#147;floor price&#148;; and (iv) section 6.d.iv.: &#147;cap conversion rate&#148;. the provisions of this section 6.a.ii. shall apply to related and any subsequent holder of the related shares. b. mechanics of conversion; fractional shares . i. each cumulative convertible preferred shareholder who desires to convert its 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares into common shares shall provide notice to the company&#146;s offices in the form of the notice of conversion attached to this amended and restated certificate of designation (a &#147; conversion notice &#148;) via telecopy, hand delivery or other mail or messenger service. the original conversion notice and the certificate or certificates representing the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares for which conversion is elected, shall be delivered to the company by nationally recognized courier, duly endorsed. the date upon which a conversion notice is initially received by the company shall be a &#147;notice date.&#148; each conversion will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the certificate representing 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares shall have been surrendered and notice shall have been received by the company or in the case of a conversion pursuant to section 6.a.ii., on the 20th trading day upon which the condition contained therein is met, and the conversion shall be at the conversion rate in effect at such time and on such date. the company shall use all reasonable efforts to issue and deliver within three (3) business days after the notice date, to such cumulative convertible preferred shareholder at the address of the holder on the books of the company, a certificate or certificates for the number of common shares to which the holder shall be entitled as set forth herein; provided that the original certificates representing the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares to be converted are received by the transfer agent or the company within three (3) business days after the notice date and the person or persons entitled to receive the common shares issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such common shares on such date such original certificates are received. a-15 ii. if the conversion rate results in a cumulative convertible preferred shareholder being entitled to receive a fractional common share with respect to the aggregate 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares being converted pursuant to a conversion notice, in lieu of the issuance of such fractional common share, the company shall pay to the cumulative convertible preferred shareholder cash in an amount equal to the closing price of a common share at the close of business on the trading day prior to the conversion date multiplied by the fraction representing the fractional share. c. anti-dilution adjustments to conversion rate . i. if, prior to the conversion of all 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, the number of issued and outstanding common shares is increased by a payment of distributions in common shares on any class or series of the company&#146;s shares or other similar event, then the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date shall be increased by multiplying such conversion rate by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the total number of common shares outstanding at the close of business on such record date and the total number of common shares with respect to such distribution; and (b) the denominator of which shall be the number of common shares outstanding at the close of business on such record date. such increase shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the record date fixed for such determination. if any distribution of the type described in this section 6.c.i is declared but not so paid or made, the conversion rate shall again be adjusted to the conversion rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. ii. if, prior to the conversion of all 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, the company subdivides, combines, reclassifies or splits its outstanding common shares into a greater number of common shares, the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, reclassification or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case the company shall, while any of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares are outstanding, combine or reclassify its outstanding common shares into a smaller number of common shares, the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, reclassification, split or combination becomes effective, so that any 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive that number of common shares which it would have received had such 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event adjusted as a result of such event; a-16 iii. if, prior to the conversion of all 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, the company issues rights or warrants to all or substantially all holders of our outstanding common shares entitling them to subscribe for or purchase common shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common shares), at a price per share (or having a conversion, exchange or exercise price per share) less than the average of the closing sales prices (the &#147; closing sales price &#148;) of a common share on the nyse or any other national or regional securities exchange or other over-the-counter market in the united states on which the common shares are then traded or quoted on the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the announcement by public notice of such issuance or distribution (treating the conversion, exchange or exercise price per common share of the securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for common shares as equal to (x) the sum of (i) the price for a unit of the security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common shares and (ii) any additional consideration initially payable upon the conversion of or exchange or exercise for such security into common shares divided by (y) the number of common shares initially underlying such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security), then the conversion rate shall be increased by multiplying the conversion rate in effect at the opening of business on the date after such date of announcement by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which shall be the number of common shares outstanding at the close of business on the date of announcement, plus the total number of additional common shares so offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities so offered are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable); and (b) the denominator of which shall be the number of common shares outstanding on the close of business on the date of announcement, plus the number of common shares (or convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities) which the aggregate offering price of the total number of common shares (or convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities) so offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion, exchange or exercise price of the convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities so offered) would purchase at such closing sale price of the common shares. such increase shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the record date for such determination. to the extent that common shares (or securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into common shares) are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the conversion rate shall be readjusted to the conversion rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of common shares (or securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into common shares) actually delivered. in the event that such rights or warrants are a-17 not so issued, the conversion rate shall again be adjusted to be the conversion rate which would then be in effect if the record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase common shares at less than such closing sale price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such common shares, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration if other than cash, to be determined by the board. iv. (a) if, prior to the conversion of all 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, the company, by distribution or otherwise, distributes to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding common shares (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the company is the continuing company and the common shares are not changed or exchanged), capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets, including securities, (including capital stock of any subsidiary of the company) but excluding (a) dividends or distributions of common shares referred to in section 6.c.i; (b) any rights or warrants referred to in section 6.c.iii; (c) dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash and (d) dividends and distributions of securities or other property or assets (including cash) in connection with a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, tender offer for all or substantially all of our common shares or sale of all or substantially all of the company&#146;s assets to which section 6.c.v applies (such securities, evidence of its indebtedness or other assets being distributed hereinafter in this section 6.c.iv called the &#147; distributed assets &#148;), then, in each such case, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section 6.c.iv., the conversion rate shall be increased by multiplying the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date with respect to such distribution by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which shall be the current market price; and (b) the denominator of which shall be such current market price, less the fair market value on such date of the portion of the distributed assets so distributed applicable to one common share (determined on the basis of the number of common shares outstanding on such record date) on such date. such increase shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the record date for such distribution. in the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the conversion rate shall again be adjusted to be the conversion rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (b) if the board determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this section 6.c.iv by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any distributed assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the &#147; reference period &#148;) used in computing the current market price pursuant to this section 6.c.iv to the extent possible, unless the board determines in good faith that determining the fair market value during the reference period would not be in the best interest of the holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares. a-18 (c) in the event any such distribution consists of capital stock or common shares of, or similar equity interests in, one or more of the company&#146;s subsidiaries (a &#147; spin off &#148;), the fair market value of the securities to be distributed shall equal the average of the closing sale prices of such securities for the five consecutive trading days commencing on and including the sixth trading day of those securities after the effectiveness of the spin off, and the current market price shall be measured for the same period. in the event, however, that an underwritten initial public offering of the securities in the spin off occurs simultaneously with the spin off, the fair market value of the securities distributed in the spin off shall mean the initial public offering price of such securities and the current market price shall mean the closing sale price for the common shares on the same trading day. (d) rights or warrants distributed by the company to all holders of the outstanding common shares entitling them to subscribe for or purchase equity securities of the company (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (&#147; trigger event &#148;), (x) are deemed to be transferred with such common shares, (y) are not exercisable and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common shares, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 6.c.iv (and no adjustment to the conversion rate under this section shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest trigger event. if such right or warrant is subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of which such right or warrant shall become exercisable to purchase different distributed assets, or entitle the holder to purchase a different number or amount of the foregoing distributed assets or to purchase any of the foregoing distributed assets at a different purchase price, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be the date of issuance and record date with respect to a new right or warrant (and a termination or expiration of the existing right or warrant without exercise by the holder thereof). in addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any trigger event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto, that resulted in an adjustment to the conversion rate under this section 6.c.iv: (a) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the conversion rate shall be readjusted upon such final repurchase to give effect to such distribution or trigger event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share repurchase price received by a holder of common shares with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of common shares as of the date of such repurchase; and (b) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise, the conversion rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had never been issued. a-19 (e) for purposes of this section 6.c.iv and section 6.c.i, section 6.c.ii and section 6.c.iii, any dividend or distribution to which this section 6.c.iv is applicable that also includes (x) common shares to which section 6.c.i applies, (y) a subdivision, split or combination of shares of common shares to which section 6.c.ii applies or (z) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase common shares to which section 6.c.iii applies (or any combination thereof), shall be deemed instead to be: (a) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants, other than such common shares, such subdivision, split or combination or such rights or warrants to which section 6.c.i, section 6.c.ii and section 6.c.iii apply, respectively (and any conversion rate adjustment required by this section 6.c.iv with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), immediately followed by (b) a dividend or distribution of such common shares, such subdivision, split or combination or such rights or warrants (and any further conversion rate increase required by section 6.c.i, section 6.c.ii and section 6.c.iii with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except: the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as (x) &#147;the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution&#148; and &#147;record date&#148; within the meaning of section 6.c.i, (y) &#147;the day upon which such subdivision, reclassification or split becomes effective&#148; or &#147;the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective&#148; (as applicable) within the meaning of section 6.c.ii, and (z) as &#147;the record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants&#148; and such &#147;record date&#148; within the meaning of section 6.c.iii; and (ii) any reduction or increase in the number of common shares resulting from such subdivision, split or combination (as applicable) shall be disregarded in connection with such dividend or distribution. v. if, prior to the conversion of all 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, the company shall be a party to any transaction (including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, tender offer for all or substantially all of our common shares or sale of all or substantially all of the company&#146;s assets), as a result of which common shares shall be converted into the right to receive securities or other property (including cash or any combination thereof), each 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share, if any share thereof remains outstanding and is convertible after the consummation of the transaction, shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares and other securities and property (including cash or any combination thereof) receivable upon the consummation of such transaction by a holder of that number of common shares or fraction thereof into which one 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred share was convertible immediately prior to such transaction, assuming such cumulative convertible preferred shareholder failed to exercise any rights of election to convert (provided that if the kind and amount of stock or beneficial interest, securities and other property so receivable is not the same for each non-electing share, the kind and amount so receivable by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount received per share by a plurality of non-election shares). the company may not become a party to any such transaction unless the terms thereof are consistent with the foregoing. a-20 vi. if, prior to the conversion of all 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares, the company makes cash distributions (other than distributions in connection with the company&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, distributions on the cumulative perpetual convertible cra shares or other preferred shares, ordinary course distributions or quarterly distributions consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of common shares equal to or less than $0.15 per share, subject to adjustment for subdivisions, combinations, reclassifications or splits of the company&#146;s common shares), the conversion rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the shareholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which shall be equal to the current market price per common share on the date fixed for such determination; and (b) the denominator of which shall be equal to the current market price per common share on such date fixed for determination less the amount per common share of such distribution, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where (a) the per share amount of such distribution equals or exceeds the current market price of the common shares, or (b) the current market price of the common shares exceeds the per share amount of such distribution by less than $1.00, in lieu of the adjustment set forth in this section 6.c.vi., holders will have the right to receive upon conversion, in addition to common shares, if any, such distribution such holders would have received upon conversion of such holders&#146; 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares if they had been converted immediately prior to the record date. vii. no adjustment of the conversion rate is required to be made in any case until cumulative adjustments amount to 1% or more of the conversion rate. any adjustments not so required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in subsequent adjustments. viii. in addition to the foregoing adjustments, the company is permitted to make such reductions in the conversion price as the company considers to be advisable in order that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights will not be taxable to the holders of common shares. ix. for purposes of this section 6.c, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: a-21 (a) &#147; current market price &#148; on any date means the average of the daily closing sale prices per common share for the ten consecutive trading days immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that if: (1) the &#147;ex&#148; date (as hereinafter defined) for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation of current market price) that requires an adjustment to the conversion rate pursuant to section 6.c.i, section 6.c.ii, section 6.c.iii, or section 6.c.iv occurs during such ten consecutive trading days, the closing sale price for each trading day prior to the &#147;ex&#148; date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing sale price by the same fraction by which the conversion rate is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event; (2) the &#147;ex&#148; date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation of current market price) that requires an adjustment to the conversion rate pursuant to section 6.c.i, section 6.c.ii, section 6.c.iii, or section 6.c.iv occurs on or after the &#147;ex&#148; date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the closing sale price for each trading day on and after the &#147;ex&#148; date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing sale price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the conversion rate is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event; and (3) the &#147;ex&#148; date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this proviso, the closing sale price for each trading day on or after such &#147;ex&#148; date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the amount of any cash and the fair market value (as determined by the board in a manner consistent with any determination of such value for purposes of section 6.c.iv) of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock or assets being distributed applicable to one common share as of the close of business on the day before such &#147;ex&#148; date. for purposes hereof, the &#147;ex&#148; date is the date on or after which a common share is traded without a previously declared issuance or distribution pursuant to the rules of a securities exchange upon which the common shares are then listed and traded. notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever successive adjustments to the conversion rate are called for pursuant to this section 6.c, such adjustments shall be made to the current market price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this section 6.c and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the board. a-22 (b) &#147; fair market value &#148; means the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm&#146;s length transaction (as determined by the board, whose determination shall be made in good faith and, absent manifest error, shall be final and binding on holders of the 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares). (c) &#147; record date &#148; means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of common shares have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the common shares (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the board or by statute, contract or otherwise). d. adjustment to conversion rate upon a fundamental change . i. if and only to the extent a holder of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares elects to convert its 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares pursuant to section 6(a) in connection with a fundamental change, the company shall increase the conversion rate applicable to the shares of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares surrendered for conversion by a number of additional common shares (the &#147;additional shares&#148;), if any, as set forth in this section 6(d). a conversion shall be deemed for the purposes of this section 6 to be &#147;in connection with&#148; a fundamental change if the applicable conversion notice is received by the company from and including the effective date of such fundamental change up to and including the fundamental change conversion date for that fundamental change. if a holder elects to convert 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares in connection with a fundamental change, but such fundamental change is not consummated, then such holder shall not be entitled to the increased conversion rate referred to above in connection with the conversion. ii. subject to the provisions of section 6.a.ii., the number of additional shares, if any, shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on the effective date of such fundamental change and the share price for such fundamental change. if an event occurs that requires an adjustment to the conversion rate as described in section 6, each applicable share price set forth in the first row of the table below shall be adjusted, concurrently with such adjustment in the conversion rate, multiplying the share price in effect immediately before the adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which is the conversion rate in effect immediately before the adjustment, and the denominator of which is the adjusted conversion rate. in addition, but without duplication of the adjustment pursuant to the preceding sentence, if an event occurs that requires an adjustment to the conversion rate as described in section 6, each applicable number of additional shares set forth in the table below shall be adjusted concurrently and in the same manner in which the conversion rate is adjusted as described in section 6. a-23 number of additional shares (per $11.70 liquidation preference of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares) share price effective date $10.27 $10.75 $12.50 $15.00 $17.50 $20.00 $25.00 1/25/2008 0.0509 0.0932 0.0639 0.0379 0.0217 0.0111 0.0000 1/23/2009 0.0509 0.0849 0.0563 0.0318 0.0173 0.0079 0.0000 1/23/2010 0.0509 0.0737 0.0459 0.0234 0.0109 0.0032 0.0000 1/23/2011 0.0509 0.0621 0.0340 0.0133 0.0031 0.0000 0.0000 1/23/2012 0.0509 0.0497 0.0192 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1/23/2013 0.0509 0.0402 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1/23/2014 0.0509 0.0404 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1/23/2015 0.0509 0.0403 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1/23/2016 0.0509 0.0391 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1/23/2017 0.0509 0.0319 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1/23/2018 0.0509 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 iii. the exact applicable share price and the effective date of such fundamental change may not be set forth in the table above, in which case: a. if the actual applicable share price is between two applicable share prices listed in the table above, and/or the actual effective date of such fundamental change is between two dates listed in the table above, the company shall determine the number of additional shares by linear interpolation between the numbers of additional shares set forth for the two applicable prices, or for the two dates based on a 365-day year, as applicable; b. if the actual applicable share price is greater than $25.00 per share (subject to adjustment as provided below, the &#147; cap price &#148;), no additional shares shall be issuable and the conversion rate shall not increase in connection with a fundamental change; and c. if the actual applicable share price is less than $10.27 per share (subject to adjustment as provided below and in section 6.a.ii., the &#147; floor price &#148;), no additional shares shall be issuable and the conversion rate shall not increase in connection with a fundamental change. iv. subject to the provisions of section 6.a.ii., in no event shall additional shares be issuable if, after giving effect thereto, the conversion rate would exceed 1.1392 (the &#147; cap conversion rate &#148;). if an event occurs that requires an adjustment to the conversion rate as described in section 6, each of the cap price, the floor price and the cap conversion rate shall be adjusted concurrently and in the same manner in which the conversion rate is adjusted as described in section 6. v. the company shall mail to holders of 11.0% cumulative convertible preferred shares notice of, or publicly announce (with subsequent prompt notice by mail), the anticipated effective date of any proposed fundamental change at least 15 days before the anticipated effective date of such fundamental change. in addition, no later than the third business day after the completion of such fundamental change, the company shall publicly announce such completion. a-24 vi. for purposes of this section 6(d), the following terms shall have the following meanings: (a) &#147; effective date of such fundamental change &#148; means, with respect to a fundamental change, the date on which such fundamental change occurs or becomes effective. (b) &#147; fundamental change conversion date &#148; means, with respect to a fundamental change, the date specified as such by the company in the fundamental change notice delivered pursuant to section 3.h.ii., which date shall be a business day and shall not be less than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which the company gives such notice. (c) &#147; share price &#148; means, with respect to a fundamental change, an amount determined as follows: (1) if the fundamental change is a transaction or series of related transactions and the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares or pursuant to statutory appraisal rights) for common shares in the fundamental change consists solely of cash, then the share price will be the cash amount paid per common share in the transaction; (2) if the fundamental change is a sale, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of property and assets and the consideration paid for the company&#146;s property and assets (or for the property and assets of the company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) consists solely of cash, then the share price will be the cash

price will be the average of the closing sale price per common share for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date. e. conversion into common shares . upon conversion

(ii) payment date . an amount calculated as being due in respect of any early termination date under section 6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an early termination date which is designated or occurs as a result of an event of default) and on the day which is two local business days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an early termination date which is designated as a result of a termination event). such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the termination currency, from (and including) the relevant early termination date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the applicable rate. isda &#210; 1992 9 such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.

(2) first method and loss . if the first method and loss apply, the defaulting party will pay to the non-defaulting party, if a positive number, the non-defaulting party&#146;s loss in respect of this agreement.

(4) second method and loss . if the second method and loss apply, an amount will be payable equal to the non-defaulting party&#146;s loss in respect of this agreement. if that amount is a positive number, the defaulting party will pay it to the non-defaulting party; if it is a negative number, the non-defaulting party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the defaulting party. (ii) termination events . if the early termination date results from a termination event: &#151; (1) one affected party . if there is one affected party, the amount payable will be determined in accordance with section 6(e)(i)(3), if market quotation applies, or section 6(e)(i)(4), if loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the defaulting party and to the non-defaulting party will be deemed to be references to the affected party and the party which is not the affected party, respectively, and, if loss applies and fewer than all the transactions are being terminated, loss shall be calculated in respect of all terminated transactions. (2) two affected parties . if there are two affected parties: &#151; (a) if market quotation applies, each party will determine a settlement amount in respect of the terminated transactions, and an amount will be payable equal to (i) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference between the settlement amount of the party with the higher settlement amount (&#147;x&#148;) and the settlement amount of the party with the lower settlement amount (&#147;y&#148;) and (b) the termination currency isda &#210; 1992 10 equivalent of the unpaid amounts owing to x less (ii) the termination currency equivalent of the unpaid amounts owing to y; and (b) if loss applies, each party will determine its loss in respect of this agreement (or, if fewer than all the transactions are being terminated, in respect of all terminated transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference between the loss of the party with the higher loss (&#147;x&#148;) and the loss of the party with the lower loss (&#147;y&#148;). if the amount payable is a positive number, y will pay it to x; if it is a negative number, x will pay the absolute value of that amount to y. (iii) adjustment for bankruptcy . in circumstances where an early termination date occurs because &#147;automatic early termination&#148; applies in respect of a party, the amount determined under this section 6(e) will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant early termination date to the date for payment determined under section 6(d)(ii). (iv) pre-estimate . the parties agree that if market quotation applies an amount recoverable under this section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise provided in this agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such losses. 7. transfer subject to section 6(b)(ii), neither this agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that: &#151; (a) a party may make such a transfer of this agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this agreement); and (b) a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any amount payable to it from a defaulting party under section 6(e). any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this section will be void. 8. contractual currency (a) payment in the contractual currency . each payment under this agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this agreement for that payment (the &#147;contractual currency&#148;). to the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this agreement in the contractual currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the contractual currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the contractual currency, of the full amount in the contractual currency of all amounts payable in respect of this agreement. if for any reason the amount in the contractual currency so received falls short of the amount in the contractual currency payable in respect of this agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the contractual currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. if for any reason the amount in the contractual currency so received exceeds the amount in the contractual currency payable in respect of this agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess. isda &#210; 1992 11 (b) judgments . to the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the contractual currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the contractual currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the contractual currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at which the contractual currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency received into the contractual currency, to purchase the contractual currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party. the term &#147;rate of exchange&#148; includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the contractual currency.

administrative agent in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the revolving exposure over the revolving credit limit, and (ii) such maximum drawing amount, which amount shall be held by the administrative agent for the benefit of the lenders and the administrative agent as cash collateral for all reimbursement obligations, and upon the reduction of the revolving credit limit to zero, or the acceleration of the reimbursement obligations with respect to all letters of credit issued for the account of the borrowers in accordance with section 11.2.1 , the borrowers shall immediately provide cash or cash equivalents to the administrative agent in an amount equal to the then maximum drawing amount on all letters of credit, which amount shall be held by the administrative agent, for the benefit of the lenders and the administrative agent, as cash collateral for all reimbursement obligations (all such cash collateral to be provided pursuant to this sentence, collectively, the &#147;cash collateral&#148;). each such payment shall be made to the administrative agent at the administrative agent&#146;s office in immediately available funds. interest on any and all amounts remaining unpaid by the borrowers under this section at any time from the date such amounts become due and payable (whether as stated in this section , by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full (whether before or after judgment) shall be payable to the administrative agent on demand and shall accrue interest at the default rate. 43 5.3 letter of credit payments . if any draft shall be presented or other demand for payment shall be made under any letter of credit, the administrative agent shall notify the borrowers of the date and amount of the draft presented or demand for payment and of the date and time when it expects to pay such draft or honor such demand for payment. if the borrowers fail to reimburse the administrative agent as provided in section 5.2 on or before the date that such draft is paid or other payment is made by the issuing bank or the administrative agent or, as a result of the applicable borrowing limits described therein being exceeded such reimbursement obligations are not satisfied by the making of a revolving loan bearing interest at the base rate applicable to revolving loans, the administrative agent may at any time thereafter notify the revolving credit lenders of the amount of any such unpaid reimbursement obligation. no later than 2:00 p.m. boston time on the business day next following the receipt of such notice, each such revolving credit lender shall make available to the administrative agent, at the administrative agent&#146;s office, in immediately available funds, such revolving credit lender&#146;s revolving loan commitment percentage of such unpaid reimbursement obligation, together with an amount equal to the product of (a) the average, computed for the period referred to in clause (c) below, of the weighted average interest rate paid by the administrative agent for federal funds acquired by the administrative agent during each day included in such period, times (b) the amount equal to such lender&#146;s revolving loan commitment percentage of such unpaid reimbursement obligation, times (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including the date the issuing bank or the administrative agent paid the draft presented for honor or otherwise made payment to the date on which such lender&#146;s revolving loan commitment percentage of such unpaid reimbursement obligation shall become immediately available to the administrative agent, and the denominator of which is 360. the responsibility of the issuing bank and the administrative agent to the borrowers and the lenders shall be only to determine that the documents (including each draft) delivered under each letter of credit in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with such letter of credit. 5.4 obligations absolute . the borrowers&#146; obligations under this section shall be joint, several, absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of the occurrence of any default or any condition precedent whatsoever or any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which either borrower may have or have had against the issuing bank or the administrative agent, any lender or any beneficiary of a letter of credit. the borrowers further agree with the administrative agent and the lenders that none of the issuing bank, the administrative agent and the lenders shall be responsible for, and the borrowers&#146; reimbursement obligations under section 5.2 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the borrowers, the beneficiary of any letter of credit or any financing institution or other party to which any letter of credit may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of either borrower against the beneficiary of any letter of credit or any such transferee. none of the issuing bank, the administrative agent and the lenders shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any letter of credit. the borrowers agree that any action taken or omitted by the issuing bank, the administrative agent or any lender under or in connection with each letter of credit and the related drafts and documents, if done in good faith and in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding 44 upon the borrowers and the guarantors and shall not result in any liability on the part of the issuing bank, the administrative agent or any lender to the borrowers or guarantors. 5.5 reliance by issuer . to the extent not inconsistent with section 5.4 , the issuing bank and the administrative agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, any letter of credit, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document reasonably believed by such person to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the issuing bank or the administrative agent. 5.6 letter of credit fees . the borrowers shall pay the following fees in respect of each letter of credit (the &#147;letter of credit fees&#148;): (a) to the administrative agent, a per annum fee in an amount equal to (i) during such time as there is outstanding no event of default, 3.00% times the maximum drawing amount of each such letter of credit, and (ii) during such time as there exists an event of default, the rate provided in section 6.12 (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law), which letter of credit fees shall be for the accounts of the lenders in accordance with their respective revolving loan commitment percentages; and (b) to the issuing bank, for the account of the issuing bank as a fronting fee, a per annum fee in an amount equal to 0.125% times the maximum drawing amount of each letter of credit. the letter of credit fees shall be paid quarterly in arrears on the first business day of each fiscal quarter for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. in respect of each letter of credit issued for the account of either borrower, the borrowers shall also pay to the issuing bank for the issuing bank&#146;s own account, at such other time or times as such charges are customarily made by the issuing bank, the issuing bank&#146;s customary issuance, amendment, negotiation, payment or document examination and other administrative fees as in effect and applicable from time to time. 6. certain general provisions. 6.1 payments to administrative agent . all payments of principal and interest on any outstanding portion of the loans and all reimbursement obligations, fees and any other amounts due hereunder or under any of the other loan documents (unless the provisions of this credit agreement or another loan document require otherwise) shall be made on the due date thereof to the administrative agent in dollars for the respective accounts of the creditor parties, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, at the administrative agent&#146;s office or at such other place as the administrative agent may from time to time designate, in each case no later than 12:00 p.m. boston time. 6.2 no offsets, taxes etc. 6.2.1 no offsets . any and all payments by the borrowers or guarantors hereunder or under any of the other loan documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all present or future taxes, unless such taxes are required by law or the administration thereof to be deducted or withheld (all such taxes, excluding the excluded taxes and other taxes, being referred to herein as &#147;covered taxes&#148;). if the 45 borrowers or guarantors shall be required by law or the administration thereof to deduct or withhold any covered taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any other loan document, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional amounts paid under this paragraph), the applicable creditor parties receive an amount equal to the sum they would have received if no such deduction or withholding had been made; (b) the borrowers and guarantors shall make such deductions or withholdings; and (c) the borrowers and guarantors shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation or other authority in accordance with applicable law. 6.2.2 other taxes . the borrowers and guarantors agree to pay, in a timely manner and in accordance with all applicable law, any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (all such taxes, charges and levies being herein referred to as &#147;other taxes&#148;) imposed by any jurisdiction (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) which arise from any payment made by the borrowers or guarantors hereunder or under any of the other loan documents or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this credit agreement or any of the other loan documents. 6.2.3 indemnification . the borrowers and guarantors agree to indemnify each of the creditor parties for the full amount of covered taxes or other taxes not deducted, withheld and paid by the borrowers or guarantors in accordance with sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 on amounts payable by the borrowers and guarantors under this section which are paid by any of the creditor parties and any liability (including penalties and interest arising therefrom or with respect thereto, other than penalties and interest attributable solely to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such creditor parties, as applicable) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not any such covered taxes or other taxes were correctly or legally asserted. payment under this indemnification shall be made within fifteen (15) days from the date a creditor party makes written demand therefor. a certificate as to the amount of such covered taxes or other taxes and evidence of payment thereof submitted to the borrowers and guarantors shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, of the amount due from the borrowers or guarantors to such creditor party. 6.2.4 non-u.s. lenders . each creditor party that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the united states (a &#147;non-u.s. lender&#148;) agrees that it shall, no later than the closing date (or, in the case of a creditor party which becomes a party hereto pursuant to this credit agreement after the closing date, on or prior to the date upon which such creditor party becomes a party hereto), and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the borrowers (but only if such non-u.s. lender or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so) deliver to the borrowers and the administrative agent two properly completed and duly executed copies of either united states internal revenue service form w-8ben, w-8eci or w-8imy or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, or any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from (or reduction in) united states federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law, in each case claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, united states federal withholding tax and payments of interest hereunder. in addition, in the case of a non-u.s. lender claiming exemption from united states federal withholding tax under section 46 871(h) or section 881(c) of the code, such non-u.s. lender (to the extent legally entitled to do so) shall deliver a certificate, in substantially the same form as exhibit 6.2.4 , to the borrowers and the administrative agent, certifying that such non-u.s. lender or beneficial owner is not (a) a bank for purposes of section 881(c)(3)(a) of the code, (b) a 10-percent shareholder of any of the borrowers within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(b) of the code, and (c) a &#147;controlled foreign corporation&#148; described in section 881(c)(3)(c) of the code. each non-u.s. lender (i) agrees that it shall promptly notify the borrowers and the administrative agent in the event any such representation provided pursuant to this section is no longer accurate and (ii) agrees that it will deliver updated versions of the foregoing, as applicable, whenever any of the previous certifications provided herein has become inaccurate in any material respect, together with such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such creditor party to a continued exemption from or reduction in united states withholding tax with respect to payments under this credit agreement. all forms provided in this section shall be delivered by each non-u.s. lender to the borrowers and the administrative agent on or before the date it becomes a party to this credit agreement and on or before the date, if any, such non-u.s. lender changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office (a &#147;new lending office&#148;). 6.2.5 u.s. lenders . any creditor party that is not a non-u.s. lender and that may not be treated as an exempt recipient based on the indicators described in treasury regulation section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) shall deliver to the borrowers on or prior to the date on which such creditor party becomes a creditor party under this credit agreement (and from time to time thereafter as prescribed by applicable law or upon the reasonable request of the borrowers), two duly executed and properly completed copies of united states internal revenue service form w-9, or any successor form that such creditor party is entitled to provide at such time in order to comply with united states back-up withholding requirements. notwithstanding any other provision in this section , no amount shall be required to be paid to a creditor party under this section with respect to backup withholding if there has been a notified underreporting pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(c) of the code (or similar provision or successor provision) with respect to such creditor party. 6.2.6 pre-existing withholding requirements . the borrowers and guarantors shall not be required to indemnify any non-u.s. lender, or pay any additional amounts to any non-u.s. lender, in respect of united states federal withholding tax pursuant to this credit agreement to the extent that the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to united states federal withholding tax existed on the date such non-u.s. lender became a party to this credit agreement or, with respect to payments to a new lending office, the date such non-u.s. lender designated such new lending office with respect to the loans; provided , however , that this clause shall not apply to the extent (i) the indemnity payment or additional amounts any transferee or assignee of any creditor party, or any creditor party through a new lending office, would be entitled to receive (without regard to this clause (i)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or additional amounts that the person making the assignment or transfer to such transferee or assignee, or creditor party making the designation of such new lending office, would have been entitled to receive in the absence of such assignment, transfer or designation, or (ii) the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such non-u.s. lender to comply with the provisions of section 6.2.4 . 47 6.2.7 mitigation . any creditor party claiming any indemnity payment or additional payment amounts payable pursuant to this section shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions), at the borrowers&#146; and guarantors&#146; expense, (a) to file any certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the borrowers, or (b) to change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or change (i) would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity payment or additional amount which may thereafter accrue, (ii) would not require such creditor party to disclose any information such creditor party deems confidential and (iii) would not, in the sole determination of such creditor party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such creditor party. 6.2.8 refunds . if any creditor party (including a transferee) determines in its sole discretion that it is entitled to claim a refund from a governmental authority in respect of covered taxes or other taxes with respect to which any of the borrowers or guarantors has paid additional amounts pursuant to this section , it will promptly notify the applicable borrower or guarantor of the availability of such refund claim and shall, within twenty (20) days after receipt of a written request by such borrower or guarantor, make a claim to the governmental authority for such refund at such borrower&#146;s or guarantor&#146;s expense. if any creditor party receives a refund (including a refund made pursuant to the preceding sentence) in respect of any covered taxes or other taxes with respect to which a borrower or guarantor has paid additional amounts pursuant to this section , such creditor party shall within ten (10) business days from the date of the receipt pay over such refund (solely to the extent of such borrower&#146;s or guarantor&#146;s payment, plus a pro rata portion of any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund) to such borrower or guarantor, net of all out of pocket expenses of such creditor party incurred in connection with obtaining such refund, including reasonable attorneys fees; provided , however , that such borrower or guarantor, upon the request of such creditor party, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such borrower or guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) to the applicable creditor party in the event such creditor party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. this section shall not be construed to require any creditor party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to a borrower, a guarantor or any other person. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event will any creditor party be required to pay any amount under this section the payment of which would place such creditor party in a less favorable net after-tax position than such creditor party would have been in if the additional amounts giving rise to such refund of any covered taxes or other taxes had never been paid. 6.2.9 evidence of payment . the borrowers and guarantors shall furnish to the administrative agent and each of the creditor parties the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing any payment of covered taxes or other taxes made by the borrowers or guarantors as soon as such receipt becomes available. 6.2.10 survival . the provisions of this section shall survive the termination of this credit agreement and repayment of all obligations for a period of one year. 6.3 computations . all computations of interest on loans, any fees or any other amount due hereunder shall, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, be based on a 365/366-day year for all base rate loans, and a 360-day year for all other purposes, and paid for the actual 48 number of days elapsed. except as otherwise provided in the definition of the term &#147;interest period&#148; with respect to libor rate loans, whenever a payment hereunder or under any of the other loan documents becomes due on a day that is not a business day, the due date for such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding business day, and interest and fees shall accrue during such extension. 6.4 interest limitation . notwithstanding any other term of this credit agreement or any other document referred to herein or therein, the maximum amount of interest which may be charged to or collected from any person liable hereunder by the lenders shall be absolutely limited to, and shall in no event exceed, the maximum amount of interest which could lawfully be charged or collected under applicable law (including, to the extent applicable, the provisions of section 5197 of the revised statutes of the united states, as amended or 12 u.s.c. section 85, as amended), so that the maximum of all amounts constituting interest under applicable law, howsoever computed, shall never exceed as to any person liable therefor such lawful maximum, and any term of this credit agreement or any other document referred to herein or therein which could be construed as providing for interest in excess of such lawful maximum, shall be and hereby is made expressly subject to and modified by the provisions of this paragraph. 6.5 inability to determine libor rate . in the event, prior to the commencement of any interest period relating to any libor rate loan, the administrative agent shall in good faith determine or be notified by the required lenders that (a) adequate and reasonable methods do not exist for ascertaining the libor rate that would otherwise determine the rate of interest to be applicable to any libor rate loan during any interest period or (b) the libor rate determined or to be determined for such interest period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the lenders of making or maintaining their libor rate loans during such period, the administrative agent shall forthwith give notice of such determination (which shall be conclusive and binding on the borrowers and the lenders) to the borrowers and the lenders. in such event (i) any revolving loan request or conversion request with respect to libor rate loans shall be automatically withdrawn and shall be deemed a request for base rate loans, (ii) each libor rate loan will automatically, on the last day of the then current interest period relating thereto, become a base rate loan and (iii) the obligations of the lenders to make libor rate loans shall be suspended until the administrative agent or the required lenders determine that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, whereupon the administrative agent or, as the case may be, the administrative agent upon the instruction of the required lenders, shall so notify the borrowers and the lenders. 6.6 illegality . notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any present or future law, regulation, treaty or directive or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any lender to (i) make or maintain libor rate loans, or (ii) perform its obligations in respect of any libor rate loan, such lender shall forthwith give notice of such circumstances to the borrowers, the administrative agent and the other lenders and thereupon (a) the commitment of such lender to make libor rate loans or convert any outstanding portion of the loans of another type to libor rate loans shall forthwith be suspended, and (b) such lender&#146;s loans then outstanding as libor rate loans if any such loans exist, shall be converted automatically to base rate loans on the last day of each interest period applicable to such libor rate loans or within such earlier period as may be required by law. the borrowers hereby agree promptly to pay to the administrative agent for the account of such lender, upon 49 demand by such lender, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such lender for any costs incurred by such lender in making any conversion in accordance with this section , including any interest or fees payable by such lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its libor rate loans hereunder. 6.7 additional costs, etc. if any present or future applicable law, which expression, as used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations thereunder and interpretations thereof by any governmental authority charged with the administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives, instructions and notices at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or otherwise issued to any creditor party by any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall: 6.7.1 taxes . subject any creditor party to any tax or withholding of any nature with respect to this credit agreement, the other loan documents, any letters of credit, such creditor party&#146;s commitment or the libor rate loans, or change in the basis of taxation of payments to such creditor party (other than taxes, levies, imposts, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings covered by section 6.2 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any excluded tax payable by such creditor party), or 6.7.2 reserves . impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this credit agreement) any special deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law) against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans by, or letters of credit issued by, or commitments of an office of any creditor party), or 6.7.3 other costs . impose on any creditor party any other conditions or requirements with respect to this credit agreement, the other loan documents, such lender&#146;s commitment, any letters of credit or the libor rate loans, and the result of any of the foregoing is: (a) to increase the cost to any creditor party of making, funding, issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of the libor rate loans, such commitment, any letter of credit, or (b) to reduce the amount of principal, interest, reimbursement obligation or other amount payable to such creditor party hereunder on account of such commitment, any letter of credit or any outstanding portion of the loans, or (c) to require such creditor party to make any payment or to forego any interest or reimbursement obligation or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment or foregone interest or reimbursement obligation or other sum is calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by such creditor party from the borrowers hereunder, then, and in each such case, the borrowers will, upon demand made by such creditor party at any time and from time to time and as often as the occasion therefor may arise, pay to such creditor party such additional amounts as will be sufficient to compensate such creditor party for such additional cost, reduction, payment or foregone interest or reimbursement obligation or 50 other sum upon presentation by such creditor party of a certificate in accordance with section 6.9 ; provided that the borrowers shall not be liable to any creditor party for costs incurred more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to receipt by the borrowers of such certificate from such creditor party, as applicable, unless such costs were incurred prior to such 180-day period solely as a result of such present or future applicable law being retroactive to a date which occurred prior to such 180-day period. 6.8 capital adequacy . if after the date hereof any creditor party determines that (i) the adoption of or change in any law, governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by a court or governmental authority with appropriate jurisdiction, or (ii) compliance by such creditor party or any corporation controlling such creditor party with any law, governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such entity regarding capital adequacy, has the effect of reducing the return on such creditor party&#146;s commitment with respect to any outstanding portion of the loans to a level below that which such creditor party could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such creditor party&#146;s then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming full utilization of such entity&#146;s capital) by any amount deemed by such creditor party to be material, then such creditor party may notify the borrowers of such fact upon presentation of a certificate in accordance with section 6.9 . to the extent that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not reflected in the base rate, the borrowers and such creditor party shall thereafter attempt to negotiate in good faith, within thirty (30) days of the day on which the borrowers receive such notice, an adjustment to the compensation payable hereunder which will adequately compensate such creditor party in light of these circumstances. if the borrowers and such creditor party are unable to agree to such adjustment within thirty (30) days of the date on which the borrowers receive such notice, then commencing on the date of such notice (but not earlier than the effective date of any such increased capital requirement), the fees payable hereunder shall increase by an amount that will, in such creditor party&#146;s reasonable determination, provide adequate compensation; provided that the borrowers shall not be liable to any creditor party for costs incurred more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to receipt by the borrowers of such notice. each creditor party shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in good faith and on an equitable basis. 6.9 certificate . a certificate setting forth any additional amounts payable pursuant to section 6.7 or section 6.8 and a reasonably detailed explanation of such amounts which are due, submitted by any creditor party to the borrowers, shall be prima facie evidence in the absence of manifest error that such amounts are due and owing. 6.10 mitigation obligations; replacement of lenders . 6.10.1 designation of a different lending office . if any lender requests compensation, or the borrowers are required to pay any additional amounts to or for the benefit of such lender, pursuant to section 6.6 , section 6.7 or section 6.8 , or if any lender gives a notice pursuant to section 6.6 , then such lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different domestic lending office or libor lending office for funding or booking any portion of its outstanding loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of 51 its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts compensable or payable pursuant to section 6.6 , section 6.7 or section 6.8 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to section 6.6 as applicable, and (b) in each case, would not subject such lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such lender. the borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 6.10.2 survival . all of the borrower&#146;s obligations under section 6.7 , section 6.8 , section 6.9 and this section shall survive termination of the commitments and repayment of all other obligations hereunder. 6.11 indemnity . the borrowers agree to indemnify the administrative agent and each lender and to hold each of them harmless from and against any loss, cost or expense that such person may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the borrowers in payment of the principal amount of or any interest on any libor rate loans as and when due and payable, including any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by such lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its libor rate loans, (b) default by the borrowers in making a borrowing or conversion after a borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a revolving loan request or a notice (in the case of all or any portion of the loans pursuant to section 2.3.4 ) or a conversion request relating thereto in accordance with section 2.3.1 or 2.3.2 or (c) the making of any payment of a libor rate loan or the making of any conversion of any such outstanding portion of the loans to a base rate loan on a day that is not the last day of the applicable interest period with respect thereto, including interest or fees payable by such lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain any such libor rate loans. 6.12 interest and fees after event of default . at the administrative agent&#146;s discretion or upon written request of the required lenders, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the borrowers shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding obligations (other than letter of credit fees) at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the default rate, and letter of credit fees at a rate equal to 2% above the otherwise applicable fee, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws. 6.13 replacement of lenders .

to the administrative agent, together with interest thereon at the applicable default rate from the date of such expenditure until paid. notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrative agent shall not have any liability or responsibility whatsoever for the performance of any obligation of such person under this credit agreement or any other loan document in the absence of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. all amounts expended by the administrative agent pursuant to this section shall constitute obligations secured by the collateral. 11.6 rights cumulative . the rights and remedies of the administrative agent and the other creditor parties under this credit agreement and each of the other loan documents shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any of them may otherwise have under applicable law. in exercising their respective rights and remedies the administrative agent and the other creditor parties may be selective and no failure or delay by any such person in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude its other or further exercise or the exercise of any other power or right. 12. setoff. regardless of the adequacy of any collateral, if any event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, any deposits or other sums credited by or due from the administrative agent or any other creditor party to either borrower or any of the guarantors and any securities or other property of either borrower or any of the guarantors in the possession of the administrative agent or such other creditor party or any of their respective affiliates may, at any time, solely with the consent of the administrative agent, without demand or notice (any such notice being expressly waived by the borrowers and the guarantors), in whole or in part, be applied to or set off by the administrative agent or such other creditor party against the payment of obligations, now existing or hereafter arising, of the borrowers or any of the guarantors to the administrative agent or such other creditor party regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral securing any outstanding portion of the loans. the administrative agent and each of the other creditor parties agree with and among each other that (i) if an amount to be set off is to be applied to indebtedness of the borrowers or any of the guarantors to the administrative agent or such other creditor party, such amount shall be applied ratably first to obligations owed to the creditor party exercising such right of set off and pro rata to any other similarly situated creditor parties, and then to the obligations owed all other creditor parties, including, without limitation, reimbursement obligations owed to the issuing bank or all lenders, and (ii) if the administrative agent or such other creditor party shall receive from either borrower or any guarantor or any other source, whether by voluntary payment, exercise of the right of setoff, counterclaim, cross action, enforcement of the claim evidenced by this credit agreement in the name of, or constituting reimbursement obligations owed to, the administrative agent or such other creditor party by proceedings against a borrower or a guarantor at law or in equity or by 87 proof thereof in bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, receivership or similar proceedings, or otherwise, and shall retain and apply to the payment of the obligations owed to the administrative agent or such other creditor party any amount in excess of its ratable portion of the payments received by all of the creditor parties with respect to the debt evidenced hereby corresponding to all of the creditor parties, such creditor party will make such disposition and arrangements with the other creditor parties with respect to such excess, either by way of distribution, pro tanto assignment of claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each creditor party receiving in respect of the debt evidenced hereby in its name or reimbursement obligations owed it, its proportionate payment as contemplated by this credit agreement; provided that if all or any part of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such creditor party, such disposition and arrangements shall be rescinded and the amount restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. any and all rights to require the administrative agent to exercise its rights or remedies with respect to any other collateral which secures the obligations, prior to the administrative agent or any other creditor party exercising any right of setoff with respect to such deposits, credits or other property of either borrower or any guarantor are hereby knowingly, voluntarily and irrevocably waived. 13. the administrative agent. 13.1 authorization . 13.1.1 authorization to act . the administrative agent is authorized to take such action on

&#147; quarterly distribution payment date &#148;), commencing on the first quarterly distribution payment date after the first issuance of series b share or a fraction of a series b share, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash distributions, and 1,000,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash distributions, other than a distribution payable in shares of existing shares or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of existing shares (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the common shares since the immediately preceding quarterly distribution payment date or, with respect to the first quarterly distribution payment date, since the first issuance of any series b share or fraction of a series b share. in the event the company shall at any time declare or pay any distribution on the existing shares payable in existing shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a distribution on the shares of existing shares) into a greater or lesser number of existing shares, then in each such case the amount to which holder of series b shares were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be appropriately adjusted. b. the company shall declare a distribution on the series b shares as provided in paragraph (a) of this section 2 immediately after it declares a distribution on the existing shares (other than a distribution payable in existing shares); provided that, in the event no distribution shall have been declared on existing shares during the period between any quarterly distribution payment date and the next subsequent quarterly distribution payment date, a distribution of $1.00 per share on the series b shares shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent quarterly distribution payment date. c. distributions shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding series b shares from the quarterly distribution payment date next preceding the date of issue of such shares,

shares entitled to receive a quarterly distribution and before such quarterly distribution payment date, in either of which events such distributions shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such quarterly payment date. accrued but unpaid distributions shall not bear interest. distributions paid on the series b shares in an amount less than the total amount of such distributions at the time

existing shares, or effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding existing shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a distribution in existing shares) into a greater or lesser number of existing shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of series b shares were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be appropriately adjusted. b. except as otherwise provided herein, in any other certificate of designations creating a series of shares of the company, or by law, the holders of series b shares and the holders of existing shares and any other shares of beneficial interest in the company having general voting rights shall vote together as one single class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the company. c. except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of series b shares shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of existing shares as set forth herein) for taking any trust action. d. if, at the time of any annual meeting of shareholders for the election of members of the board, the equivalent of six quarterly distributions (whether or not consecutive) payable on any series b share or series b shares are in default, the number of members of the board constituting the board shall be increased by two. in addition to voting together with the holders of existing shares for the election of the other members of the board, the holders of record of a majority of the series b shares, voting separately as a class to the exclusion of the holders of existing shares, shall be entitled at such meeting of shareholders (and at each subsequent annual meeting of shareholders), unless all distributions in arrears on the series b shares have been paid or declared and set apart for payment prior thereto, to nominate and vote for the election of two members of the board, the holders of any series b shares being entitled to cast a number of votes per series b share as is specified in paragraph (a) of this section 3. each such additional member of the board shall serve until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, or until his right to hold such office terminates pursuant to the provisions of this section 3(d). until the default in

section 3(d) may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the series b shares, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the vote of such holders. if and when such default shall cease to exist, the holders of series b shares shall be divested of the foregoing special voting rights, subject to revesting in the event of each a-3 and every subsequent like default in payments of distributions. upon the termination of the foregoing special voting rights, the terms of office of all persons who may have been elected members of the board pursuant to said special voting rights shall forthwith terminate, and the number of members of the board constituting the board shall be reduced by two. the voting rights granted by this section 3(d) shall be in addition to any other voting rights granted to the holders of series b shares in this section 3. 4. certain restrictions . a. whenever quarterly distributions or other distributions payable on the series b shares as provided in section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid distributions, whether or not declared, on series b shares outstanding

dissolution or winding up) to the series b shares; ii. declare or pay distributions, or make any other distributions, on any shares ranking on a parity (either as to distributions or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the series b shares, except distributions paid ratably on the series b shares and all such parity shares on which distributions are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such share are then entitled; iii. redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares ranking junior (either as to distributions or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the series b shares, provided that the company may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any such junior shares in exchange for any shares of the company ranking junior (both as to distributions and upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the series b shares; or iv. redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any series b shares, or any shares ranking on a parity with the series b shares, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the board) to all holders of

good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes. b. the company shall not permit any subsidiary of the company to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any share of beneficial interest in the company unless the company could, under paragraph (a) of this section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner. 5. reacquired shares . any series b shares purchased or otherwise acquired by the company in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. all

amount equal to accrued and unpaid distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of series b shares shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of common shares, or ii. to the holders of shares ranking on parity (either as to distributions or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the series b shares, except distributions made ratably on the series b shares and all such parity shares in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. b. in the event the company shall at any time declare or pay any distribution on the existing shares payable in existing shares, or effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding existing shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a distribution in existing shares) into a greater or lesser number of existing shares, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of series b shares were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (i) above shall be appropriately adjusted. c. in the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the series a liquidation preference and the liquidation preferences of all other classes and series of shares of beneficial interest in the company, if any, that rank of a parity with the series b shares in respect thereof, then the assets available for such distribution shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the series b shares and the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. d. neither the merger or consolidation of the company into or with another entity nor the merger or consolidation of another entity into or with the company shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company within the meaning of this section 6. 7. consolidation, merger, etc . in case the company shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the existing shares are exchanged for or changed into other shares or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each a-5 series b share shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth equal to 1,000,000 times the aggregate amount of shares, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each common share is changed or exchanged. in the event the company shall at any time declare or pay any distribution on the existing shares payable in existing shares, or effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding existing shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a distribution in existing shares) into a greater or lesser number of existing shares, then in each such case the amount set forth

amendment . at any time share of series b shares are outstanding, this certificate of designation shall not be further amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the series b shares so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding series b shares, voting separately as a single class. 11. fractional shares . series b shares may be issued in fractions of a share that shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder&#146;s fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive distributions, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of series b shares. 12. governing law . this certificate of designation shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware (without regard to conflict of laws principles), all rights and remedies being governed by such laws. 13.

march, 2010. centerline holding company by: name: title: a-8 exhibit b summary of rights &#091;exhibit b &#151; summary of rights&#093; summary of rights to purchase series b shares on march 5, 2010, the board of trustees (the &#147; board &#148;) of centerline holding company, a delaware statutory trust (the &#147; company &#148;), delegated to the rights plan evaluation committee (the &#147; committee &#148;) a distribution of one series b special share purchase right (a &#147;right&#148;) for each common share (the &#147; common shares &#148;), convertible community reinvestment act preferred share (the &#147; cra shares &#148;), series a convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares (the &#147; series a cra shares &#148;), special preferred voting shares (the &#147; special preferred shares &#148;), and 15 rights for each special series a share (the &#147; special shares &#148; and, together with the common shares, the cra shares, the series a cra shares and the special preferred shares, the &#147; existing shares &#148;) of the company outstanding at the close of business on or after the date of the committee&#146;s resolution approving the distribution. the committee has declared such distribution in respect of all such shares as of march &#091; &#159; &#093;, 2010 (the &#147; record date &#148;). as long as the rights are attached to the existing shares, the company will issue one right (subject to adjustment) with each new common share, cra share, series a cra share and special preferred share, and 15 rights with each new special share issued prior to the distribution date or the expiration date (as defined below) so that all such shares will have attached rights. when exercisable, each right will entitle the registered holder to purchase from the company one one-millionth of a series b special share (the &#147; series b shares &#148;) at a price of $0.66 per one one-millionth of a series b share, subject to adjustment (the &#147; purchase price &#148;). the description and terms of the rights are set forth in a tax benefits preservation plan, dated as of march 5, 2010, as the same may be amended from time to time (the &#147; agreement &#148;), between the company and computershare trust company, n.a., a federally chartered trust company (the &#147; rights agent &#148;). by adopting the agreement, the board is seeking to protect the company&#146;s ability to carry forward its net operating losses and certain other tax attributes (collectively, the &#147; nols &#148;). the company has experienced and may continue to experience substantial net operating losses, and for federal and state income tax purposes, the company may &#147;carry forward&#148; net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset current and future taxable income, which will reduce federal and state income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. these federal and state nols can be a valuable asset of the company, which may inure to the benefit of the company and it shareholders. however, if the company experiences an &#147;ownership change&#148;, as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code, as amended (the &#147; code &#148;), its ability to use the nols could be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the nols could be substantially delayed, which would significantly impair the value of the company&#146;s nol asset. generally, an &#147;ownership change&#148; occurs if the percentage of the shares of beneficial interest in the company (i.e., the existing shares) owned by one or more &#147;five percent shareholders&#148; b-1 increases by more than fifty percentage points over the lowest percentage of shares of beneficial interest owned by such shareholder at any time during the prior three-year period or, if sooner, since the last &#147;ownership change&#148; experienced by the company. therefore, an nol rights agreement with a 5% &#147;trigger&#148; threshold is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or entity acquiring 5% or more of the outstanding existing shares without the prior approval of the board. this would protect the company&#146;s nol asset because changes in ownership by a person or entity owning less than 5% of the existing shares are not included in the calculation of &#147;ownership change&#148; for purposes of section 382 of the code. until the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth business day following a public announcement that a person, entity or group of affiliated or associated persons or entities has become a five percent (5%) shareholder (as defined in the agreement) (an &#147; acquiring person &#148;) or (ii) ten business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the board prior to such time as any person, entity or group of affiliated persons or entities becomes an acquiring person) following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in a person becoming an acquiring person (the earlier of (i) and (ii) being called the &#147; distribution date &#148;), the rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the certificates evidencing existing shares outstanding as of the record date, by such certificate (or, with respect to any existing shares held in book entry form, by notation in book entry) together with a copy of this summary of rights. the agreement provides that any person or entity who otherwise would be a five percent 5(%) shareholder on the date the agreement was adopted, together with any affiliates and associates of that person or entity (each an &#147; existing holder &#148;), shall not be deemed to be an &#147;acquiring person&#148; for purposes of the agreement unless such holder increases its &#147;percentage stock ownership&#148; by more than one-quarter of one percentage point over such holder&#146;s lowest percentage stock ownership on or after the consummation of the relevant transaction, subject to certain exceptions for increases due to repurchases or redemptions, stock dividends, stock splits and the like. the agreement includes a procedure whereby the board will consider requests to exempt certain proposed acquisitions of existing shares from the applicable ownership trigger if the board determines that the requested acquisition will not jeopardize or endanger the availability of the nols to the company. the agreement provides that until the distribution date (or earlier redemption, exchange, termination or expiration of the rights), the rights will be transferred with and only with the existing shares. until the distribution date (or earlier redemption, exchange, termination or expiration of the rights), certificates for new existing shares (and ownership statements in respect of uncertificated shares) issued after the close of business on the record date upon transfer or new issuance of the existing shares will contain a notation incorporating the agreement by reference. until the distribution date (or earlier redemption, exchange, termination or expiration of the rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for existing shares or any book entry shares, with or without such notation, notice or a copy of this summary of rights, will also constitute the transfer of the rights associated with the existing shares represented by such certificate or uncertificated shares. b-2 as soon as practicable following the distribution date, separate certificates evidencing rights (the &#147; right certificates &#148;) will be mailed to the holders of record of existing shares as of the close of business on the distribution date and such separate right certificates alone will evidence the rights. the rights are not exercisable until the distribution date. the rights will expire thirty six (36) months and one day after the date of the agreement (the &#147; final expiration date &#148;), subject to the company&#146;s right to extend such date, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the company or terminated. each series b share purchasable upon the exercise of the rights will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly distribution payment of the greater of (a) $1.00 per share, or (b) an aggregate distribution of 1,000,000 times the distribution, if any, declared per common share. in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, the holders of series b shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $10.00 per share (plus any accrued but unpaid distributions), provided that such holders of series b shares will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 1,000,000 times the payment made per common share. each series b share will have 1,000,000 votes and will vote together with the shares of beneficial interest of the company. finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of beneficial interest are exchanged, each series b share will be entitled to receive 1,000,000 times the amount received per common share. series b shares will not be redeemable. these rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions. because of the nature of the series b share&#146;s distribution, liquidation and voting rights, the value of one one-millionth of a series b share purchasable upon exercise of each right should approximate the value of one common share. the purchase price payable, and the number of series b shares or other shares of beneficial interest in the company or property of the company issuable, upon the exercise of the rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution. in general, at any time after a person or entity becomes an acquiring person, the board may cause the company to exchange the rights (other than rights owned by an acquiring person which will have become void), in whole or in part, for series b shares (or common shares or special shares) at an exchange rate of one one-millionth of a series b share (subject to adjustment) for each right. no adjustment in the purchase price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such purchase price. no fractional series b shares or existing shares will be issued (other than fractions of series b shares which are integral multiples of one one-millionth of a series b share, which may, at the election of the company, be evidenced by depository receipts), and in lieu thereof, a payment in cash will be made based on the market price of the series b shares or existing shares on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise. the rights may be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.00001 per right (the &#147; redemption price &#148;) by the board at any time prior to the time that an acquiring person has b-3 become such. the redemption of the rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the board in its sole discretion may establish. immediately upon any redemption of the rights, the right to exercise the rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of rights will be to receive the redemption price. until a right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a shareholder of the company beyond those as an existing shareholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive distribution. any of the provisions of the agreement may be amended by the board for so long as the right are then redeemable, and after the rights are no longer redeemable, the company may amend or supplement the agreement in any manner that does not adversely affect, in any material way, the interests of the holders of the rights (other than an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate of an acquiring person). a copy of the agreement has been filed with the securities and exchange commission as an exhibit to a current report on form 8-k. a copy of the agreement is available free of charge from the company. this summary description of the rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference. b-4 exhibit c form of right certificate &#091;exhibit c
