(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;for each cit year, the holders of the s&amp;e b shares shall be entitled to a distribution equal in the aggregate to the cosan tax savings of all subsidiaries of the sugar and ethanol co for such cit year. &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if, as a result of an audit by a governmental authority or of direct action taken by a subsidiary of the sugar and ethanol co before the initiation of an audit by a governmental authority purporting to investigate the respective tax matter, the figure in respect of the cit taxable base or nol of any subsidiary of the sugar and ethanol co is different from the figure previously used in respect thereof to calculate the cosan tax savings for the same cit year such that the actual cosan tax savings are: (i) greater than the amount in respect of which prior distributions have been made for the same cit year, then the holders of the s&amp;e b shares shall be entitled to an additional distribution equal to such &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 41 &#160; &#160; &#160; excess, which shall be paid in accordance with paragraph (g); or (ii) less than the amount in respect of which prior distributions have been made for the same cit year, then the holders of the s&amp;e b shares that received the excess amount pursuant to this section 9.02 shall repay that amount (plus, solely if the amendment directly relates to the cosan goodwill or to the cosan pre-closing nol (and not to other items of the cit taxable base or nol), any penalties, adjustments, costs and expenses incurred as a result of the related unpaid cit or the repayment under this paragraph (ii)) to the sugar and ethanol co so as to put the sugar and ethanol co in the same after-tax cash position as if there had been made no excess distributions and no corresponding adjustments in the cit taxable base or nol;

(f)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the reductions required pursuant to paragraph (e) exceed the amount of any distribution otherwise due to holders of s&amp;e b shares: (i) such excess amount shall be applied in the calculation of distributions in any subsequent cit years to reduce any distributions otherwise then due to holders of s&amp;e b shares; and (ii) upon the termination of the joint venture, the holders of s&amp;e b shares at the time of such termination, shall promptly pay any remaining excess amount (after applying the provisions of paragraph (f)(i) above) to the sugar and ethanol co (or to any successor in law) so as to put the sugar and ethanol co (or any successor in law) in the same after-tax cash position as if there had been no excess distributions and no corresponding adjustments in the cit taxable base or nol; provided that any such remaining excess amount shall first be applied to offset amounts, if any, owed to such holders of s&amp;e b shares by the sugar and ethanol co. &#160; (g)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;each distribution provided for under this section 9.02 shall be: (i) unless otherwise specified, paid as a single payment in brl and made within 20 business days of the statutory deadline for filing the cit tax return with respect to that cit year for the sugar and ethanol co and its subsidiaries;

&#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;either cosan or shell, together with a majority of the executive board, reasonably determines that it is likely that the sugar and ethanol co will default on any of its material debt obligations and/or become unable to pay its debts as they fall due or is otherwise determined to be insolvent, in each case, within 90 days, and therefore requires further equity capital; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 43 &#160; &#160; &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;after completion of the shell partial call option, but before any completion of the cosan partial call option (in each case, as defined in the joint venture agreement), the supervisory board determines that the sugar and ethanol co requires further equity capital based on the then current business plan or due to any unforeseen capital requirement (including a potential default or insolvency event within 90 days) that may arise after the preparation of such business plan (in this latter case, as determined by the supervisory board);

provided that, if the funds to be provided from a capital call are required more urgently than within the period it would take for such a valuation to be completed, funds may be paid on account by way of a loan by the shareholder to the sugar and ethanol co convertible into shares upon completion of such valuation. &#160;
