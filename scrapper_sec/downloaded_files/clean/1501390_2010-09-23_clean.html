beneficial ownership percentage. in each case, the reporting persons&#146; beneficial ownership percentage would be approximately 49.9%. the issuer also stated in the form 20-f that during 2009, it issued 2,200,000 ordinary shares to its share depository bank which will be used to settle stock option awards upon their exercise (the &#147; option reserve shares &#148;). according to the issuer&#146;s statements in the form 20-f, no consideration was received by the issuer for the issuance of the option reserve shares and any of the option reserve shares not used in the settlement of stock option awards will be returned to the issuer. the issuer further stated in the form 20-f that the option reserve shares are legally issued and outstanding but are treated as escrowed shares for accounting purposes and therefore the issuer excluded the option reserve shares from the computation of earnings per share. moreover, for purposes of calculating beneficial ownership in the form 20-f, the issuer excluded the option reserve shares from the number of ordinary share equivalents deemed outstanding. accordingly, the reporting persons have excluded the option reserve shares from the number of outstanding ordinary shares for purposes of calculating and reporting the reporting persons&#146; beneficial ownership in this schedule 13d. 18 (b) hanwha solar holdings co., ltd.: (1) sole voting power: 208,347,863 (2) shared voting power: 0 (3) sole dispositive power: 208,347,863 (4) shared dispositive power: 0 hanwha chemical corporation: (1) sole voting power: 208,347,863 (2) shared voting power: 0 (3) sole dispositive power: 208,347,863 (4) shared dispositive power: 0 hanwha corporation: (1) sole voting power: 208,347,863 (2) shared voting power: 0 (3) sole dispositive power: 208,347,863 (4) shared dispositive power: 0 seung-yeon kim: (1) sole voting power: 208,347,863 (2) shared voting power: 0 (3) sole dispositive power: 208,347,863 (4) shared dispositive power: 0 (c) the information in item 4 above is incorporated herein by reference.
