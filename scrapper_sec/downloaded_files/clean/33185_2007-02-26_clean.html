manage portfolio risk, and develop marketing strategies for consumers and businesses. it also provides to consumers a portfolio of products to manage and protect their financial affairs. the name,

amount of funds or other consideration on february 14, 2007, talx entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#147;merger agreement&#148;) with equifax and a wholly-owned subsidiary of equifax (&#147;merger sub&#148;) that provides for the acquisition of talx by equifax by means of a merger of talx into merger sub (the &#147;merger&#148;). as a result of the merger, talx would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of equifax. in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, william w. canfield, the chairman of the board and chief executive officer and president of talx (the &#147;shareholder&#148;) entered into a shareholder agreement with equifax dated february 14, 2007 (the &#147;shareholder agreement&#148;), providing for the voting of the shareholder&#146;s talx common stock as described in item 4 below. equifax did not pay additional consideration to the shareholder in connection with the execution of the shareholder agreement, and thus no funds were used for such purpose. item 4. purpose of transaction subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time and as a result of the merger, each share of talx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares as to which appraisal rights are properly asserted under missouri law and shares owned by equifax, talx, or their

as elected by holders of talx common stock. this election is subject to the limitation that 75% of the outstanding shares of talx common stock be exchanged for equifax common stock and 25% for cash, with proration to be applied in the event of oversubscription. as a result of the merger, talx would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of equifax and the talx common stock would be de-listed from and no longer quoted on the nasdaq stock market. pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, the talx common stock would no longer be registered under such act. 3 cusip no.

agreement, the merger, and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and any other action intended to facilitate consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. the shareholder is required to vote, or cause to be voted, such shares against any acquisition proposal other than the merger agreement or any amendment of talx&#146;s articles of incorporation or bylaws, or any other proposal, action, or transaction which would be reasonably expected to prevent or impede or delay the merger, the merger agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. the shareholder has agreed not to transfer, pledge, assign, tender, or otherwise dispose of or consent to or permit any transfer of any shares or any interest therein, or enter into any contract, option, or other arrangement with respect to any transfer (including any profit sharing or other derivative arrangement) of any shares or any interest therein, to any person other than pursuant to the shareholder agreement or the merger agreement, unless prior to any such transfer the transferee of such shares enters into a shareholder agreement with equifax on terms substantially identical to the terms of the shareholder agreement. if the shareholder is not present at the meeting at which the vote of talx shareholders is taken, the shareholder has granted to and appointed equifax and certain designated representatives as the shareholder&#146;s proxies to vote all of his talx shares in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the merger and against any acquisition proposal or other transactions that would prevent, impede, or delay the merger. the shareholder agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the effective time of the merger and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. the shareholder agreement is included as exhibit 2 hereto and the description of the shareholder agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to exhibit 2, which is incorporated herein by reference. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer by virtue of the shareholder agreement, equifax may be
