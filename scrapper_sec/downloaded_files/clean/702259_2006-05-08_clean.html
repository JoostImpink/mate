below), and siemens med us did not pay any consideration therefore. page 4 of 16 item 4. purpose of the transaction siemens med us, dresden acquisition corporation, a corporation organized under the

accordance with the relevant provisions of the california general corporation law (the &#147;cgcl&#148;), merger sub will be merged with and into the company (the &#147;merger&#148;), and that each outstanding share of the company&#146;s common stock (other than certain shares more fully described in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive $58.50 per share of the company&#146;s common stock in cash (the &#147;merger consideration&#148;), without interest, following the waiver or satisfaction of conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including obtaining the approval of the company&#146;s shareholders. as a result of the merger, the separate corporate existence of merger sub shall cease and the company will continue as the surviving corporation (the &#147;surviving corporation&#148;) and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of siemens med us. if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated, the shares of the company&#146;s common stock will be delisted from the new york stock exchange and deregistered under section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934. under the merger agreement, unless otherwise determined by siemens med us, from and after the effective time of the merger (the &#147;effective time&#148;) the directors and officers as provided in the merger agreement shall be the initial directors and officers of the surviving corporation. such persons shall serve as directors or hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. further, under the merger agreement, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of merger sub, as in existence immediately prior to the effective time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation from and after the effective time unless and until amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by applicable law. concurrently with entering into the merger agreement, siemens med us entered into a voting agreement with each of marilyn ziering, michael ziering and ira ziering (each a &#147;shareholder&#148; and, collectively, the &#147;shareholders&#148;), each dated as of april 26, 2006, pursuant to which, among other things, each shareholder has agreed to cause his or her shares of the company&#146;s common stock to be voted

has agreed to execute and deliver such other documents and instruments and take such further actions as are necessary in order to ensure that siemens med us receives the benefit of his or her respective voting agreement. each of the voting agreements terminates upon the earliest to occur of (i) the mutual written consent of siemens med us and the shareholder; (ii) the effective time; (iii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; or (iv) an amendment to the merger agreement that reduces or otherwise changes the form of the merger consideration to which the shareholders would have been entitled. pursuant to each of the voting agreements, the respective shareholder appointed siemens med us as such shareholder&#146;s proxy to vote such shareholder&#146;s shares of the company&#146;s common stock at any meeting of shareholders of the company or in other circumstances (i) in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the merger and (ii) against any acquisition proposal other than the merger. under the terms of each of the voting agreements, each respective shareholder affirmed that his or her proxy is coupled with an interest and (subject to
