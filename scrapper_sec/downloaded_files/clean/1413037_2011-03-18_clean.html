provided , however , that the issuer may not utilize this right more than once in any 12-month period. the issuer shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any demand registration after the issuer has effected two demand registrations and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective and the securities offered pursuant to such registrations have been sold. the issuer shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any demand registration during the period starting with the date 60 days prior to the issuer&#146;s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date 180 days after the effective date of, a registration statement pursuant to which the holders are entitled to piggyback registration rights (as described below). 9 piggyback registration rights if the issuer proposes to register under the securities act any of its securities for sale by a security holder (other than (i) pursuant to a registration in connection with an employee benefit or stock ownership plan, (ii) pursuant to sections 5 or 9 , or (iii) a registration relating solely to a rule 145 transaction) and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of registrable securities, the company will give prompt written notice to all holders of its intention to effect such a registration. the company will include in such registration all shares of registrable securities which holders of registrable securities request the company to include in such registration by written notice given to the company within twenty (20) days after receipt of the above-described notice from the company. form s-3 registration rights if the issuer shall receive from any holder a written request that the company file a registration statement on form s-3 (or any successors thereto) with aggregate proceeds of at least $500,000 (a &#147;

if the company shall furnish to the holders initiating the registration on form s-3 a certificate signed by the president of the company stating that, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be seriously detrimental to the company and its stockholders for such form s-3 registration statement to be filed and it is therefore essential to defer such filing; in which event the company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the holders initiating the registration on form s-3 under this section 9, provided, however, that the company may not utilize this right more than once in any twelve-month period; or &#183; if the company has, within any 90-day period already effected one (1) registration or within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of such request already effected two (2) registrations on form s-3 for holders pursuant to this section 9; &#183; if the company has effected two (2) such registrations pursuant to this section 9; or &#183; in any particular jurisdiction in which the company would be required to qualify to do business or to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance unless the company is already subject to such service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the securities act. except as otherwise set forth above, the holders shall be entitled to request an unlimited number of registrations on form s-3. expenses of registration subject to certain limitations, the issuer will pay all registration expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, related to any registration effected pursuant to the investor rights agreement. indemnification the investor rights agreement contains customary cross-indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the issuer is obligated to indemnify the selling stockholders in the event of material misstatements or omissions in the registration statement attributable to the issuer, and the selling stockholders are obligated to indemnify the issuer for material misstatements or omissions attributable to them. 10 termination no holder shall be entitled to exercise any registration rights after the earlier of such time as rule 144 or another similar exemption under the securities act is available for the sale of all of such holder&#146;s shares during a three-month period without registration, without reference to the unlimited resale provisions of rule 144. right of first offer subject to certain exceptions (as set for the below), each time the issuer proposes to offer any shares of, or securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of, any class of its capital stock (&#147;rofr shares&#148;), the issuer shall first make an offering of such rofr shares to each holder (the &#147;rofr&#148;). a holder who chooses to exercise the right of first offer may designate as purchasers under such right itself or its partners, members or affiliates in such proportions as it deems appropriate. the following offerings of securities are excluded from the rofr and securities proposed to be issued in such transactions are not considered rofr shares: &#183;
