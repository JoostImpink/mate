(a-c, f) this statement on schedule 13d is being filed by salomon inc, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of delaware. all of the common stock reported herein is directly beneficially owned by salomon inc or by salomon brothers inc, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of delaware ("sbi"). sbi is a wholly owned subsidiary of salomon brothers holding company inc, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of delaware ("sbhc"), which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of salomon inc. the principal executive offices of sbi, sbhc and salomon inc are located, and the principal business activities of each are conducted, at seven world trade center, new york, new york 10048. the principal business of salomon inc is the ownership of all the outstanding shares of common stock of sbhc and phibro inc., a corporation engaged in commodities trading, concentrating on crude oil and other energy related commodities. the principal business of sbhc is the ownership of all the outstanding shares of common stock of sbi. sbi is a registered broker-dealer, the principal business of which is the general brokerage, dealer and investment banking business. the names, citizenship, business addresses and principal occupations or employments of each of the executive officers and directors of salomon inc and of sbhc and sbi are set forth in annexes a and b hereto respectively, which are incorporated herein by reference. (d-e) on may 20, 1992, sbi and salomon inc (together "salomon") consented, without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the concurrently filed complaint, to the entry of a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief (the "final judgment") in settlement of an action arising out of alleged misconduct in auctions of u.s. treasury securities and government securities trading, brought by the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") in the united states district court for the southern district of new york, entitled securities and exchange commission v. salomon inc and salomon brothers inc (92 civ. 3691 and securities and exchange act release no. 30721 (may 20, 1992)) (the "treasury matter"). among other things, the final judgment enjoins salomon from violations of section 17(a) of the securities act of 1933 (the "1933 act"), sections 10(b), 15(c)(1) and 17(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "1934 act") and rules 10b-5, 15c1-2, 17a-3 and 17a-4 promulgated thereunder. pursuant to the settlement, salomon was required to pay a total amount of $290,000,000, with $100,000,000 going to a fund for the payment of private claims for compensatory damages arising out of the u.s. treasury auction and page 3 of 17 pages related matters and $190,000,000 to the united states in payment of civil penalties under the securities enforcement remedies and penny stock reform act of 1990 and a forfeiture of assets to and settlement of claims with the department of justice against sbi. on the same day, in other related actions solely involving sbi, the sec instituted and settled an administrative proceeding relating to a failure to supervise the persons responsible for the alleged misconduct, the federal reserve bank of new york announced the continuation of sbi's primary dealer designation but a cessation of its trading activity with the federal reserve bank until august 3, 1992, and the department of treasury announced that sbi would be permitted to resume bidding for customers on august 3, 1992, having restricted sbi to purchasing securities for its own account in u.s. treasury auctions since august 18, 1991. in january and february 1993, sbi, without admitting or denying any allegations, entered into consent agreements and, in some states, consent orders with 41 state securities regulators in settlement of certain claims in respect of sbi's state broker-dealer registrations arising out of sbi's activities described in the treasury matter. pursuant to the settlement with the states, sbi agreed, among other things, to (i) comply with those provisions of the order issued by the sec in the treasury matter that imposed remedial sanctions with respect to alleged violations of securities laws by former personnel of sbi in auctions for united states treasury securities during 1990 and 1991; (ii) pay $50,000 to each state participant in the settlement as reimbursement for costs of investigation related to the treasury matter; and (iii) with respect to some states, contribute $2,000,000 to a multi-state investor protection trust fund to be created for the purpose of providing funds for projects promoting the cause of investor protection. on august 26, 1996, the sec simultaneously instituted a cease-and-desist proceeding pursuant to section 21c of the 1934 act against salomon inc and accepted salomon inc's offer of settlement. salomon inc, by its offer of settlement, consented to the imposition of a cease-and-desist order and the entry of the findings therein without admitting or denying such findings. the sec found that salomon inc had violated section 13(b)(2) of the 1934 act. specifically, the sec determined that salomon inc had failed to perform thorough and timely reconciliations of its balance sheet accounts to supporting documentation, and thus failed to identify on a timely basis erroneous entries made by its staff. moreover, salomon inc had failed to ensure that correction procedures were properly implemented in london, in part by failing to train adequately its staff to use a new automated system. these failures resulted in the overstatement of assets and income on the books, records, and accounts of salomon inc and its subsidiaries. in determining to accept salomon inc's offer of settlement, the sec considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by salomon inc and cooperation afforded the sec staff. other than as aforesaid, during the last five years neither salomon inc nor, to the best knowledge of salomon inc, any of sbhc, sbi or any of the persons listed in annexes a or b hereto, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which salomon inc, sbhc, sbi or any of such persons was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. page 4 of 17 pages item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. beneficial ownership of 3,429,796 of the shares of common stock of the issuer described in item 5 was acquired in connection with the sale by salomon inc to the issuer of all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share ("basis common stock"), of basis petroleum, inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the state of texas ("basis"). such sale was effected pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, dated as of april 22, 1997, among salomon inc, basis, valero refining and marketing company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of delaware and a wholly owned subsidiary of the issuer ("vrmc"), and the issuer (the "purchase agreement"). pursuant to the purchase agreement, the issuer delivered to salomon inc on may 1, 1997 (the "closing date") 3,429,796 shares of common stock as payment for a portion of the purchase price of basis, as more fully described in item 5. the net amounts of funds used by sbi to acquire the remaining 106,600 shares of common stock and the options to purchase 73,000 shares of common stock described in item 5 are estimated to be approximately $3,424,498 and $966, respectively. these funds came from sbi's working capital, which in the normal course includes the proceeds from day loans and demand loans entered into in the ordinary course of business with numerous banks. such loans are secured virtually entirely by securities owned by sbi. item 4. purpose of transaction. 3,429,796 of the shares of common stock to which this statement relates were acquired in connection with the sale of all of the outstanding shares of basis common stock by salomon inc pursuant to the purchase agreement. the closing of such sale occurred on the closing date. the aggregate consideration paid to salomon inc on the closing date consisted of (i) 3,429,796 shares of common stock having a value of approximately $120,000,000, (ii) cash in the amount of approximately $365,000,000, which is subject to certain post-closing adjustments and (iii) participation payments based on a fixed notional throughput and the difference, if any, between an average market crackspread and a base crackspread over a period of up to ten years. the issuer has announced that it has entered into an agreement providing for the merger (the "merger") of the issuer into pg&e corporation ("pg&e"), as a result of which the issuer's stockholders would acquire shares of common stock of pg&e in exchange for their shares of common stock. the issuer has announced that it plans to distribute, immediately prior to the merger, the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of vrmc to its stockholders (the "spin-off"). as a condition to the consummation of the sale of basis to the issuer, salomon inc entered into stockholder agreements with each of the issuer and vrmc (the "stockholder agreements") relating to the disposition of the common stock issued to salomon inc on the closing date and the stock of vrmc to be issued to salomon inc in connection with the spin-off, respectively. the stockholder agreement between salomon inc and the issuer requires the issuer page 5 of 17 pages to file and maintain a shelf registration statement to allow the continuous or delayed offering of shares of common stock delivered pursuant to the purchase agreement in the event that the merger is not consummated. such agreement prohibits the disposition of any such shares until the earlier of december 31, 1997 and the consummation of the merger (the "valero lock-up period"). the stockholder agreement between salomon inc and vrmc requires vrmc to file and maintain a shelf registration statement to allow the continuous or delayed offering of shares of vrmc common stock issued to salomon inc in connection with the spin-off. such agreement prohibits the disposition of any such shares until 90 days after the spin-off or such earlier time as the market price of such shares has increased to 115% of the market price immediately following the spin-off (the "vrmc lock-up period"). in addition, each of the stockholder agreements, among other things, (i) prohibits salomon inc, upon notice from the relevant issuer at any time beginning 150 days after the later to occur of the effectiveness of a shelf registration statement and the expiration of the valero lock-up period or the vrmc lock-up period, as the case may be, from effecting any public sale or distribution of the relevant shares until 120 days after the closing of an offering of securities by such issuer and (ii) provides the relevant issuer a right of first offer with respect to certain shares of such issuer proposed to be sold by salomon inc. in each of the stockholder agreements, salomon inc has also agreed to be present or represented by proxy at all stockholder meetings of the relevant issuer and to vote the relevant shares then benefically owned by salomon inc for persons nominated for election to the board of directors of the relevant issuer by such board of directors. copies of the stockholder agreements are attached hereto as exhibit 1 and exhibit 2, respectively, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. the remaining 106,600 shares of common stock and the options to purchase 73,000 shares of common stock described in item 5 and directly beneficially owned by sbi were acquired by sbi in the ordinary course of business using its working capital. upon the expiration of the lockup provisions of the applicable stockholder agreement, salomon inc currently intends to dispose of the common stock that it received as consideration for the sale of basis or other securities received in exchange therefor in connection with the spin-off and the merger, subject to then existing market conditions. notwithstanding the foregoing, salomon inc or sbi at any time or from time to time may, subject to the provisions of the stockholder agreements (i) acquire, or agree to acquire, or acquire put or call options relating to, additional shares of common stock or other securities of the issuer, any other securities obtained in connection with the merger or the spin-off (including, without limitation, securities issued by pg&e or vrmc) or any other securities of pg&e or vrmc (collectively, "securities"), (ii) sell, or agree to sell, or sell put or call options relating to, some or all of the securities owned by salomon inc or sbi, in each such case in the open market, in negotiated transactions or otherwise, (iii) make or receive proposals to enter into negotiations with respect to such transactions and/or (iv) surrender the securities owned by salomon inc or sbi in connection with any merger, tender offer or other acquisition transaction involving the issuer, pg&e or vrmc. salomon inc's or sbi's decisions in such regard will be based on their views of the values of the relevant securities and the prevailing price of such securities in the open market and/or in any negotiated transactions, the value of the consideration being offered in any merger, tender offer or other acquisition transaction involving the securities of the issuer, pg&e or vrmc, tax considerations and any other relevant factors. other than as described above, none of salomon inc, sbhc and sbi has any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any transactions involving the issuer, pg&e, vrmc or any of their subsidiaries or securities of the type or kind listed in item 4 of schedule 13d adopted by the sec under the 1934 act. page 6 of 17 pages item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a-b) the number of shares of common stock acquired by salomon inc on the closing date was determined based on a formula set forth in the purchase agreement. under this formula, salomon inc was to receive (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances) a number of shares of common stock equal to $120,000,000 divided by the average of the daily high and low prices per share of common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange ("nyse") on each of the last five consecutive full nyse trading days ending on and including the fifth trading day prior to the closing date, rounded down to the nearest whole share. the average of such reported high and low prices was $34.9875. accordingly, the issuer delivered 3,429,796 shares of common stock to salomon inc on the closing date. in addition to the shares of common stock delivered to salomon inc on the closing date, as of the close of business on may 1, 1997, sbi directly beneficially owned 179,600 shares of common stock, consisting of (x) 106,600 shares of common stock and (y) call options with respect to 73,000 shares of common stock. at that date, sbi also held short positions in (a) 62,450 shares of the issuer's $3.125 convertible preferred stock, convertible into 115,520 shares of common stock, and (b) call options with respect to 45,000 shares of common stock. by reason of their relationship, salomon inc and sbhc may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power with respect to shares of common stock beneficially owned by sbi. the issuer represented and warranted to salomon inc in the purchase agreement that 44,840,281 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of the close of business on march 31, 1997. the 3,429,796 shares of common stock issued to salomon inc on the closing date, together with the 179,600 additional shares of common stock directly beneficially owned by sbi (a total of 3,609,396 shares of common stock), represent approximately 7.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock (based on 48,343,077 shares of common stock outstanding, including the 3,429,796 shares issued to salomon inc on the closing date and the 73,000 shares of common stock underlying the long call options held by sbi). except as described above, neither salomon inc nor, to the best knowledge of salomon inc, any of sbhc, sbi or any of the persons listed in annexes a or b hereto beneficially owned any common stock at the close of business on may 9, 1997. (c) neither salomon inc nor, to the best knowledge of salomon inc, any of sbhc, sbi or the persons listed in annexes a or b hereto made any purchases or sales of common stock from march 7, 1997 through the close of business on may 9, 1997, other than as described in item 3 and item 4 in connection with the sale of basis.
