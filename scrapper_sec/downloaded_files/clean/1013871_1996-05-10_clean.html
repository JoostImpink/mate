amount of funds or other consideration nrg acquired its 41.86% interest in the company pursuant to the composite fourth amended and restated plan of reorganization for o'brien (the "plan"), confirmed by order of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code on february 22, 1996. a copy of the plan is attached hereto as exhibit 1. pursuant to the plan, nrg has made approximately $107,318,062 available to the various holders of claims against and equity interests in o'brien, $71,240,000 of which funds nrg loaned to the company (the "cash purchase price"). approximately $28,678,062 of the cash purchase price is allocable to the purchase of 41.86% of the common stock of the company by nrg, $20,178,062 of which was paid directly to the company as part of the cash purchase price, and $7,500,000 of which was paid to the existing stockholders of o'brien in respect of 15.845% of their shares of o'brien's common stock (the "old common stock"). the source of the above-referenced funds was nrg's working capital. item 4. purpose of transaction nrg acquired the shares of common stock reported hereby pursuant to the plan, and pursuant to the amended and restated stock purchase and reorganization agreement dated as of january 31, 1996 (the "purchase agreement"). a copy of the purchase agreements is attached hereto as exhibit 2. nrg intends to review its investment in the company on a continuing basis and may, at any time, consistent with nrg's obligations under the federal securities laws, determine to increase or decrease its ownership of shares of common stock through purchases or sales of shares of common stock in the open market or in privately-negotiated transactions. nrg's review of its investment in the company will depend on various factors, including the company's business prospects, other developments concerning the company, general economic conditions, money and stock market conditions, and any other facts and circumstances which may become known to nrg regarding its investment in the company. at this time, nrg has no plans to purchase shares of common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. the plan and the purchase agreement provide for seven directors of the company. pursuant to the purchase agreement, nrg has the right to appoint four of such seven directors. on april 30, 1996, the effective date of the plan (the "effective date"), nrg chose to reserve its right to appoint one of such four directors until a later date. nrg expects to appoint a seventh director of the company within the next several months. o'brien's old common stock was traded on the american stock exchange (the "amex") until september, 1994, when the stock was delisted from the amex. the company's common stock is currently trading on the nasdaq's otc bulletin board. except as set forth above, nrg has no present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in (i) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company; (iv) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure; (v) changes in the company's charter or bylaws or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of page 4 of 6 the company by any person; (vi) causing a class of securities of the company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or cease to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (vii) a class of equity securities of the company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934; or (viii) any action similar to any of those described above. however, nrg retains its rights to modify its plans with respect to the transactions described in this item 4, to acquire or dispose of securities of the company and to formulate plans and proposals which could result in the occurrence of any such events, subject to applicable laws and regulations. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer as of april 30, 1996, nrg directly beneficially owned, and had the sole power to vote, 2,710,357 shares of common stock of the company, which represented 41.86% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company. pursuant to the plan, the holders of the old common stock of o'brien (the "old equity holders") are entitled to receive a pro rata share of 3,764,457 shares, or 58.14% of the common stock of the company in exchange for their shares of old common stock. the old equity holders of record on the effective date received a letter of transmittal from the stock transfer agent for the old common stock. the old equity holders who validly surrender their certificates of old common stock, accompanied by an executed letter of transmittal, will receive approximately .22 shares of the company's common stock in exchange for each share of old common stock. as a co-proponent of the plan, the official committee of equity security holders had the right to appoint one director of the company. in addition, the holders of o'brien's old common stock who are members of the official committee of equity security holders had the right to appoint a second director of the company jointly with wexford management corp. except as disclosed above, nrg has not effected any transaction involving shares of common stock of the company during the past 60 days. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer to the best knowledge of nrg, there are at present no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) between nrg and any person with respect to any securities of the company, including but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities of the company, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss or the giving or withholding of proxies, or a pledge or contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power or investment power over the common stock of the company (other than standard default and similar provisions contained in loan agreements). item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit 1 --composite

claims cash amount, second, to repay the nrg mandatory supplemental loan, and third, to repay nrg the then outstanding amount owing in respect of the dip loan and pay wexford the remaining unpaid portion of the wexford administrative claim, which shall be on a proportional basis in the event the remaining excess cash is not sufficient to pay the full amount outstanding in respect of the dip loan and the portion of the wexford administrative claim remaining unpaid. if the remaining excess cash is sufficient to pay in full the then outstanding amount of the dip loan and any unpaid portion of the wexford administrative claim, any amounts of excess cash available after paying in full such amounts will be applied in redemption of the new o'brien preferred stock distributed under the plan. article vii: cramdown if any impaired class of claims or interests shall fail to accept the plan with the requisite majorities in accordance with bankruptcy code section 1126(c), the proponents reserve the right to request that the court determine that the plan is fair and equitable as to, and does not discriminate against, each such class and confirm the plan in accordance with bankruptcy code section 1129(b). the proponents hereby request the court to determine that the plan is fair and equitable as to, and does not unfairly discriminate against, class 19 in accordance with bankruptcy code section 1129(b). if any holder of a secured claim in class 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 (other than the subclass treated in class 4.3) or 11 fails to accept the plan or any of 15b or 15c fails to accept the plan by the requisite majorities in accordance with bankruptcy code section 1126(c), (i) any such holder of a secured claim shall receive the collateral putback treatment if and to the extent provided in any treatment election notice which may be given to such holder and (ii) at the proponents' option, the distributions from the post-petition interest fund which the holders in any such non-accepting class are entitled to receive under sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7, 5.8, 5.12 or 5.13, as applicable, shall be reduced or eliminated to the extent provided, in the case of distributions from the post-petition interest fund, in section 6.11. if the class 15a claims held by the holders of the secured claims in classes 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 in respect of the deficiency amount

sections 365 and 1123(b)(2), each executory contract or unexpired lease to which o'brien is a party that is listed on schedule 8.1 hereto, and any old options, to the extent that such old options constitute executory contracts under bankruptcy code section 365 (the "rejected contracts") shall be rejected, effective on the effective date. any claim for damages arising from rejection of any rejected contract pursuant to the plan shall be forever barred unless a proof of claim therefor in proper form is filed with the court no later than twenty days after notice of the confirmation date

and 1123(b)(2) of the bankruptcy code, all executory contracts and unexpired leases to which the debtor is a party that are not rejected contracts (the "assumed contracts") shall be assumed, effective

amount as may be determined, in each instance, by agreement between nrg and the non-debtor party to the contract or, in the case of any dispute, by final order of the court. article ix: rights and obligations of reorganized o'brien as plan administrator 9.1 appointment of plan administrator. because the proponents have jointly determined by written notice filed with the court prior to entry of the confirmation order that the duties and responsibilities of plan administrator shall be performed by reorganized o'brien rather than an appointed plan administrator, all responsibilities of plan administration provided for herein shall be performed by reorganized o'brien. 9.2 exculpation. no holder of a claim or an interest, or representative thereof, shall have or pursue any claim or cause of action (1) against reorganized o'brien for making distributions in accordance with the plan, holding or administering the distribution reserves in accordance with the plan or for implementing the provisions of the plan, or (2) against any holder of a claim or interest for receiving or retaining payments or other distributions as provided for by the plan. 9.3 powers of reorganized o'brien. pursuant to the terms and provisions of the plan and the confirmation order, reorganized o'brien shall be empowered to (a) make distributions contemplated by the plan, including without limitation by holding and administering the distribution reserves; (b) file and prosecute objections to disputed claims (other than disputed class 15 claims); (c) employ, retain, or replace professionals to

complying with all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on it by any governmental unit. article x: procedures for resolving and treating disputed claims 10.1 objection deadline. unless otherwise provided by order of the court, no objections to claims that are allowed claims on the effective date shall be filed after the effective date. no later than 60 days after the effective date, objections to claims that are disputed claims on the effective date shall be filed with the court and served upon the holders of each of the disputed claims. 10.2 responsibility for objection to disputed claims. (a) reorganized o'brien. reorganized o'brien shall be responsible for objecting to the allowance of, settling and litigating any disputed claims (other than disputed class 15 claims) following the effective date on behalf of reorganized o'brien, the entire cost of which, including any fees and expenses of its counsel and other professionals, shall be borne by reorganized o'brien. nothing herein shall affect the right of any other party in interest to file an objection to any disputed claim. nrg shall have the right to object to the allowance of any administrative claim. none of the proponents shall object to the allowance of the wexford administrative claim. (b) creditors' committee. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, following the effective date, the creditors' committee shall be responsible for objecting to the allowance of, settling and litigating any disputed class 15 claims on behalf of reorganized o'brien, the entire cost of which, including the fees and expenses of its counsel and other professionals (collectively, the "objection resolution expenses"), shall be funded through and paid from the cash payment fund. in connection with the prosecution of objections to class 15 claims, the creditors' committee shall have the exclusive right to assert all defenses, offsets, recoupments and counterclaims, including without limitation defenses under section 502(d) of the bankruptcy code that are based upon claims or causes of action retained by the reorganized debtor under section 14.3 or otherwise as a defense to the allowance of any class 15 claim; provided that any settlement of counterclaims asserted by the creditors' committee on behalf of reorganized o'brien in accordance with the foregoing shall require the consent of reorganized o'brien, and any disputes between the creditors' committee and reorganized o'brien with respect to the assertion and settlement of such counterclaims shall be resolved by the bankruptcy court. it is understood that the creditors' committee is intended to have the benefit of any such counterclaim up to the amount of the respective disputed class 15 claim and that reorganized o'brien is intended to have the benefit of any such counterclaim in excess of the amount of the respective disputed class 15 claim. the creditors' committee shall not object to any claim acquired by wexford or any affiliate of wexford prior to the commencement of the confirmation hearing except on the basis that all or any portion of any such claim should be disallowed because the debtor's records do not reflect the claimed amount as due and owing. reorganized o'brien shall reasonably cooperate with the creditors' committee in the creditors' committee's prosecution of objections to the allowance of disputed class 15 claims, including by providing access to relevant documentation that the creditors' committee reasonably determines is necessary to prosecute objections to disputed class 15 claims. the objection resolution expenses shall be paid by reorganized o'brien solely from the cash payment 32 fund without the necessity of any approval by the court or review or other action by reorganized o'brien; provided that, at least fifteen days prior to any payment being made by reorganized o'brien in respect of any objection resolution fees, the creditors' committee shall file with the court and serve a notice (a "fee request notice") setting forth the amount of objection resolution expenses requested to be paid and the period covered thereby, and shall promptly provide to any of such parties who so request a copy of a statement of services rendered setting forth in appropriate detail a description of the services performed during the period in question on the following parties: (i) each holder of an allowed class 15a claim, (ii) each holder of one of the five largest class 15b claims, (iii) each old indenture trustee, (iv) wexford and (v) reorganized o'brien; provided further that, if any holder of a class 15 claim that has not then been disallowed in full or withdrawn files with the court and serves on the creditors' committee and reorganized o'brien, within ten days after the creditors' committee shall have filed and served any fee request notice in accordance with the foregoing, an objection to the payment of any fees or expenses that are the subject of such fee request notice, reorganized o'brien shall not make payment from the cash payment fund the amount as to which any such holder has so objected until such objection is withdrawn or the court shall have resolved the objection. reorganized o'brien shall set aside in the disputed claims reserve such amount as the creditors' committee may request to serve as a reserve for the payment of all objection resolution expenses projected to be incurred following the effective date; provided that, promptly after the final resolution date, any remaining amount so reserved shall be released and distributed to the holders of allowed class 15 claims. 10.3 no distributions pending allowance. notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, no payments or distributions shall be made with respect to a disputed claim unless and until such claim shall be allowed by final order or the time by which reorganized o'brien or the creditors' committee, as applicable, is required to file an objection to such claim shall have passed without the timely filing of an objection. 10.4 distributions after allowance. payments and distributions from reorganized o'brien to each holder of a disputed claim, to the extent that it ultimately becomes an allowed claim, shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the plan governing the class of claims to which the disputed claim belongs. on the distribution date in respect of a disputed claim that becomes an allowed claim after the effective date, any cash that would have been distributed in respect of the disputed claim had it been an allowed claim at the effective date shall be distributed, with interest thereon to the extent earned after the effective date and before the distribution date, net of any taxes paid pursuant to section 10.9. 10.5 treatment of contingent claims. until such time as a contingent claim becomes an allowed claim, such claim shall be treated as a disputed claim. in the case of the holder of a claim against the debtor that has recourse against an affiliate of the debtor or any collateral security provided by any affiliate of the debtor, the allowable amount of such claim shall be estimated by the court prior to or at the confirmation hearing and shall be reduced by the present value, as determined by the court as of the effective date, of the amount or value that such holder is expected to realize as a result of recourse to such affiliate or collateral security thereof. 10.6 estimation of claims. the proponents may, prior to the confirmation date, and reorganized o'brien may, at any time thereafter, request that the court estimate any contingent claim pursuant to section 502(c) of the bankruptcy code. in the event that the court estimates any contingent claim, that estimated amount will constitute either the 33 allowed amount of such claim or a maximum limitation on such claim, as determined by the court. if the estimated amount constitutes a maximum limitation on such claim, reorganized o'brien or the creditors' committee, as applicable, may elect to pursue any supplemental proceedings to object to or estimate for allowance purposes any ultimate payment on such claim. 10.7 disputed claims reserve. (a) from and after the effective date, distributions in respect of the class 15 supplemental payment and from the cash payment fund and the post- petition interest fund shall be reserved by reorganized o'brien for the holders of disputed class 15 claims and deposited in segregated accounts to be held and administered by reorganized o'brien (the "disputed claims reserve"). the distributions so deposited in the disputed claims reserve shall be held in trust by reorganized o'brien for the benefit of the holders of class 15 claims. except to the extent the court shall determine that a good and sufficient reserve for disputed class 15 claims is less than the full amount thereof, in determining the amount of the distributions due to the holders of allowed class 15 claims and the amount to be reserved for disputed class 15 claims, the appropriate calculations shall be made as if all disputed claims were allowed as of the effective date in the full amount claimed by the holders thereof (which, in the case of contingent claims, shall be such maximum amount as may be estimated by the court prior to or at the confirmation hearing). in the case of disputed class 15 claims covered by any insurance policy under which the debtor is the insured, the debtor shall not be required to reserve an amount in excess of the respective debtor's self-insured retention liability in respect of such claim. (b) in the case of a claim that is asserted as an administrative claim or priority claim but which reorganized o'brien believes constitutes, in whole or in to reserve within the disputed claims reserve for disputed class 15 claims the amount of cash that would have been distributable on the effective date if such claim then constituted an allowed class 15 claim, provided such claim is treated as an unresolved administrative and priority claim and a reserve therefor is accordingly included in the administrative and priority claims reserve. (c) all cash held in the disputed claims reserve shall be invested in such investments as permitted under section 345 of the bankruptcy code. all interest earned on such investments shall be held in trust in the disputed claims reserve and shall be distributed only in the manner set forth below in this section 10.7. (d) to the extent that a disputed class 15 claim is allowed after the effective date, the amount of cash which the holder of such claim theretofore would have been entitled to receive if such claim had been an allowed class 15 claim on the effective date, together with interest earned on such cash (net of any taxes paid pursuant to section 10.9), shall be released from the disputed claims reserve and distributed to such holder. (e) if and to the extent the holders of allowed class 15 claims shall not, and upon receipt of such distributions will not, have received distributions under the plan from the cash payment fund equal to the required unsecured claims payment amount, at the end of each calendar quarter following the effective date and on the final resolution date, reorganized o'brien will distribute any amounts reserved from the cash payment fund (and any interest earned thereon, net of any taxes paid pursuant to section 10.9) and held in the disputed claims reserve in respect of disputed class 15 claims that have been disallowed by final order or withdrawn after the effective date or, if applicable, the end of the calendar 34 quarter following the effective date that immediately precedes such calendar quarter to the then holders of allowed class 15 claims based on their pro rata share. at the end of each calendar quarter following the effective date and on the final resolution date, reorganized o'brien will distribute any amounts reserved in respect of the class 15 supplemental payment (and any interest earned thereon, net of any taxes paid pursuant to section 10.9) and held in the disputed claims reserve in respect of disputed class 15 claims that have been disallowed by final order or withdrawn after the effective date or, if applicable, the end of the calendar quarter following the effective date that immediately precedes such calendar quarter to the then holders of allowed class 15 claims (other than the wexford-related unsecured claims) based on their pro rata share. following the disallowance by final order or the withdrawal of any disputed class 15 claim after such time as the holders of allowed class 15 claims shall have received distributions under the plan from the cash payment fund equal to the required unsecured claims payment amount, reorganized o'brien will release the cash held in the disputed claims reserve in respect of such disputed class 15 claim (and any interest earned thereon, net of taxes paid pursuant to section 10.9) and deposit such amounts into the post-petition interest fund. promptly after all disputed class 15 claims shall have been allowed or disallowed by final order or withdrawn after the effective date, reorganized o'brien shall make a final recalculation of amounts reserved from the cash payment fund then held in the disputed claims reserve and shall distribute all such amounts (together with any interest earned thereon net of taxes paid pursuant to section 10.9) to the holders of allowed class 15 claims, to the extent such holders shall not, and upon such distribution will not, have received distributions under the plan from the cash payment fund equal to the required unsecured claims payment amount, and shall deposit any remaining amounts into the post-petition interest fund. notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, interim distributions from the post-petition interest fund may be made by reorganized o'brien, if and to the extent requested by the creditors' committee or ordered by the court on motion of any holder of an allowed class 15 claim. (f) prior to the effective date, the court shall determine the maximum amount of disputed claims (including contingent claims) to the extent necessary for reorganized o'brien to calculate the amount of distributions to be held in the disputed claims reserve. 10.8 administrative and priority claims reserve. (a) subject to section 10.8(b), the administrative and priority claims reserve shall be established on the effective date in an amount determined by the court prior to the effective date. the administrative and priority claims reserve shall serve as the sole source of payment of all unresolved administrative and priority claims that are determined by final order after the effective date to be allowed claims, irrespective of the aggregate amount at which the unresolved administrative and priority claims ultimately are allowed by the court. as unresolved administrative and priority claims are determined by final order to be allowed claims following the effective date, the allowed amount thereof or, in the case of unresolved administrative and priority claims that ultimately are determined to be allowed class 15 claims, the amount distributable in respect thereof in accordance with section 10.7, to the extent there are funds then remaining in the administrative and priority claims reserve, shall be released from the administrative and priority claims reserve and paid to the holder thereof. after (i) the time shall have expired by which any holder of an administrative claim or priority claim must file a proof of claim or be forever barred, (ii) the court shall have determined by final order the allowed amount of all unresolved administrative and priority claims and (iii) the allowed amount of all unresolved administrative and priority claims shall have been paid in full from the administrative and priority claims reserve, any funds then remaining in the administrative and 35 priority claims reserve shall be released therefrom and applied as excess cash as provided in section 6.12(c)). (b) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the administrative and cure claims cash payment exceeds the sum of the additional any), any excess cash available to be applied pursuant to section 6.12(c) on the effective date and the reserved administrative and cure claims cash amount (the amount of such excess being referred to as an "administrative claims shortfall") and, therefore, nrg is required to make an nrg mandatory supplemental loan pursuant to section 6.10 in an amount equal to the administrative claims shortfall (an "administrative shortfall loan"), the time at which all or a portion of the administrative shortfall loan shall be required to be made shall be deferred until after the effective date, as follows: (i) the amount of the administrative shortfall loan required to be made on the effective date shall equal the amount by which the effective date administrative and cure payments exceeds the sum of the additional cash amount (if any), any excess cash available to be applied pursuant to section 6.12(c) on the effective date and the reserved administrative and cure claims cash amount (the amount of such excess being referred to as the "effective date administrative shortfall loan," with the amount of the administrative shortfall loan in excess of the effective date administrative shortfall loan (the amount of such excess being referred to as the "deferred administrative shortfall amount") being deferred and potentially reduced as provided below in clause (ii) of this section 10.8(b), and (ii) at such time or times as unresolved administrative and priority claims become allowed by final order after the effective date (or in the case of such claims that are allowed, but not yet due and payable on the effective date, at such times as such claims become due and payable after the effective date), and provided that nrg shall not theretofore have made deferred administrative shortfall loans pursuant hereto in excess of the deferred administrative shortfall amount, nrg shall be required within 3 business days thereafter to make an advance to reorganized o'brien in respect of the administrative shortfall loan pursuant to the nrg supplemental loan documentation equal to the amount at which such unresolved administrative and priority claims have been so allowed or become due and payable (less any amount then available in the administrative and priority claims reserve to pay such claims), subject to the maximum amount thereof established by the court prior to the effective date in connection with the fixing of the amount of the administrative and priority claims reserve. any such advance, when received by reorganized o'brien, shall be promptly deposited in the administrative and priority claims reserve. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nrg in any event shall be required to make the administrative shortfall loan on the effective date to the extent necessary to fund the payment of all cure payments and administrative claims and priority claims that are allowed and due and payable on the effective date. 10.9 payment of taxes in respect of the distribution reserves. reorganized o'brien shall pay, or cause to be paid, out of the interest earned on funds of each distribution reserve, any tax imposed by any governmental unit on the income generated by the funds held in that distribution reserve. notwithstanding anything to the distribution in a distribution reserve to holders of an allowed claim, the amount of such interest shall be reduced by the amount of such taxes so paid by reorganized o'brien. reorganized o'brien shall also file or cause to be filed any tax or information returns related to the distribution reserves that are required by any governmental unit. 36

before march 15, 1996; provided that, if the effective date shall not have occurred on or before march 15, 1996 solely because isra approval and/or bpu approval shall not have been received, the

conditions. the proponents may waive any condition or any portion of any condition set forth in this article xi at any time without notice and without leave of or order of the court. article xii:

discharged and released to the fullest extent permitted by section 1141 of the bankruptcy code from any and all 'debts' (as that term is defined in bankruptcy code section 101(11) and claims that arise prior to the effective date, including but not limited to debts of the kind specified in bankruptcy code section 502(g), 502(h), or 502(i), whether or not (a) a proof of claim based upon such debt is filed or deemed filed under section 501 of the bankruptcy code; (b) a claim based upon such debt is allowed under section 502 of the bankruptcy code; or (c) the holder of a claim based upon

property dealt with under the plan any other or further claim based upon any act or omission, transaction, or other activity of 37 any kind or nature that occurred prior to the effective date, whether or not a proof of claim has been filed, such claim is allowed, or the holder of such claim accepted the plan. 12.2 discharge of liens. except as otherwise provided in the plan or in any contract, instrument, release, indenture or other agreement or document created in connection with the plan, on the effective date, all mortgages, deeds of trust, liens or other security interests against the property of the estate shall be fully released and discharged automatically and without the need for further action, and all of the rights, title and interest of any holder of such mortgages, deeds of trust, liens or other security interests will revert to reorganized o'brien and its successors and assigns. notwithstanding the foregoing, each holder of a claim in any of classes 1 through 14 that is to receive full payment of its claim in cash on the effective date, in exchange for and as a condition to such holder's receiving such payment, shall execute and deliver to reorganized o'brien a uniform commercial code termination statement, discharge of tax lien, or other documents and instruments, all in such form and substance as the proponents may reasonably require, reasonably necessary to evidence of record the discharge of the lien or liens securing such holder's claim. if any such holder fails to execute and deliver to reorganized o'brien any such documents or instruments within 90 days after the tender thereof to such holder, then the effect shall be the same as though such holder's distribution had been tendered and remained unclaimed. 12.3 injunction. except as provided in the plan or confirmation order, as of the a claim or other debt or liability that is discharged or an interest or other right of the plan are permanently restrained and enjoined from taking any of the following actions on account of any such discharged claims, debts or liabilities or terminated interests or rights: (a) commencing or continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding against the debtor or its property; (b) enforcing, attaching, collecting or recovering in any manner, any judgment, award, decree or order against the debtor or its property; (c) creating, perfecting or enforcing any lien or encumbrance against the debtor or its property; (d) asserting a setoff, right of subrogation or recoupment of any kind against any debt, liability or obligation due to the debtor or its property; and (e) commencing or continuing any action, in any manner, in any place that does not comply with or is inconsistent with the provisions of the plan. as of the effective date, all entities that have held, currently hold or may hold a claim, demand, debt, right, cause of action or liability that is released pursuant to this plan are permanently enjoined from taking any of the following actions on account of such released claims, demands, debts, rights, causes of action or liabilities: (i) commencing or continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding; (ii) enforcing, attaching, collecting or recovering in any manner any judgment, award, decree or order; (iii) creating, perfecting or enforcing any lien or encumbrance; (iv) asserting a setoff, right of subrogation or recoupment of any kind against any debt, liability or obligation due to any released entity; and (v) commencing or continuing any action, in any manner, in any place that does not comply with or is inconsistent with the provisions of the plan. by accepting distributions pursuant to the plan, each holder of an allowed claim or an allowed interest receiving distributions pursuant to the plan will be deemed to have specifically consented to the injunctions set forth in this section. 12.4 exculpations and limitations of liability. to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the debtor, nrg, the equity committee, the creditors' committee, wexford and their respective directors, officers and employees (provided that, in the case of the debtor, only the current directors, officers and employees), agents, advisors, attorneys and members and professionals, acting in such capacity, will neither have nor incur any liability to any entity for any act taken or omitted to be taken in connection with or 38 related to the chapter 11 case or the formulation, preparation, dissemination, implementation, confirmation or consummation of the plan, the disclosure statement or any contract, instrument, or other agreement or document created or entered into, or any other act taken or omitted to be taken in connection with the plan or the chapter 11 case; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this section 12.4 will have no effect on: (1) the liability of any entity that would otherwise result from the failure to perform or pay any obligation or liability under the plan or any contract, instrument, or other agreement or document to be delivered in connection with the plan; and (2) the liability of any entity that would otherwise result from any such act or omission to the extent that such act or omission is determined in a final order to have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct. article xiii: retention of jurisdiction 13.1 retention of jurisdiction. pursuant to sections 1334 and 157 of title 28 of the united states code, from and after the confirmation date, the court shall retain and have jurisdiction of all matters arising in, arising under, and related to the chapter 11 case and the plan pursuant to, and for the purposes of, sections 105(a) and 1142 of the bankruptcy code and for, among other things, the following purposes: (a) to hear and determine objections to allowance of claims and interests and any actions pursuant to bankruptcy code sections 510 and 542 through 553; (b) to hear and determine any and all adversary proceedings, applications or litigated matters pending on the effective date or brought after the effective date; (c) to hear and determine any and all applications for

appropriate in the event confirmation of the plan is for any reason stayed, reversed, revoked, modified or vacated; (h) to modify any provision of the plan to the extent permitted by the bankruptcy code and to correct any defect, cure any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the plan or the confirmation order as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of the plan; (i) to hear and determine any dispute arising under the plan or the transaction documents, or concerning the conduct of any parties in interest with respect to the plan and the transaction documents or the conduct of the chapter 11 case, its implementation and execution of any necessary documents thereunder; and to 39 hear and determine any requests to amend, modify or correct the plan, provided that such matters are brought to the court before substantial consummation as defined by bankruptcy code section 1101(2), and subject further to the restrictions provided by bankruptcy code section 1127(b); (j) to enforce and implement the terms of the plan, including the consummation thereof and the making of all payments required thereunder; (k) to hear and determine any motion to assume, reject, or assign an executory contract or unexpired lease pursuant to bankruptcy code section 365; (l) to enforce all discharge provisions of the plan and bankruptcy code sections 1141 and 524 through appropriate means, including without limitation the granting of injunctive relief; and (m) to enter such orders as may be necessary or appropriate in furtherance of consummation and implementation of the plan. 13.2 failure of court to exercise jurisdiction. if the court abstains from exercising, or declines to exercise, jurisdiction or is otherwise without jurisdiction over any matter arising in, arising under, or related to the chapter 11 case including the matters set forth in section 13.1 of the plan, this article xiii shall have no effect upon and shall not control, prohibit, or limit the exercise of jurisdiction by any other court having jurisdiction with respect to such matter. article xiv: miscellaneous provisions 14.1 compliance with tax requirements. in connection with the plan, reorganized o'brien shall comply with all withholding and reporting requirements imposed by federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities, and all distributions hereunder shall be subject to such withholding and reporting requirements. creditors may be required to provide certain tax information as a condition to receipt of distributions pursuant to the plan. 14.2 post-confirmation date fees and expenses of professional persons. after the effective date, reorganized o'brien shall, in the ordinary course of business and without the necessity for any approval by the court, pay the reasonable fees and expenses of persons employed by reorganized o'brien related to implementation and consummation of the plan; provided, however, that no such fees and expenses shall be paid except upon receipt by reorganized o'brien of a detailed written invoice. 14.3 retention of avoidance actions. pursuant to bankruptcy code section 1123(b)(3), following the effective date the debtor shall retain all claims or causes of action included in its estate, including without limitation any avoidance actions under sections 544, 549 and 550 of the bankruptcy code. 14.4 binding effect. the plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the debtor, the holders of claims or interests (whether or not such holders have filed a proof of claim or interest or have accepted the plan), nrg, the committees and wexford and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that if the plan is not confirmed, the plan shall be deemed null and void and nothing contained herein shall be deemed (i) to constitute a waiver or release of any claims by the debtor or any other entity, 40 (ii) to prejudice in any manner the rights of the debtor or any other entity, or (iii) to constitute any admission by the debtor or any other entity. 14.5 governing law. unless a rule of law or procedure is supplied by federal law (including the bankruptcy code and the bankruptcy rules) or the delaware general corporation law or the law of the jurisdiction of organization of any entity formed or to be formed pursuant to the plan, the internal laws of the state of new jersey shall govern the construction and implementation of the plan and any agreements, documents, and instruments executed in connection with the plan or the chapter 11 case, except as may otherwise be provided in such agreements, documents, and instruments. 14.6 amendments and modifications. the proponents may, in accordance with section 1127(a) of the bankruptcy code, amend or modify the plan prior to the entry of the confirmation order. any such amendment or modification proposed prior to entry of the disclosure statement order shall not require the consent of the equity committee or wexford; provided, however, that, if any such amendment or modification is made without the consent of the equity committee or wexford, such entity shall be eliminated as a proponent of the plan. after the entry of the confirmation order, the proponents may, in accordance with section 1127(b) of the bankruptcy code, amend or modify the plan, or remedy any defect or omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the plan in such manner as may be necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of the plan. 14.7 revocation. without limiting the application of section 14.6 and subject to the obligations of o'brien and nrg under the acquisition agreement and nrg's agreement set forth in a letter dated september 29, 1995 addressed to the honorable rosemary gambardella and counsel to the debtor (the "bid letter"), the proponents reserve the right to revoke and withdraw the plan prior to entry of the confirmation order. notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the proponents, by prior written notice to the court, shall have waived the effectiveness of this provision, the proponents shall be deemed to have revoked the plan if the effective date shall not have occurred on or before the date specified in section 11.2(c). if the proponents revoke or withdraw the plan pursuant to this section 14.7, then the plan shall be deemed null and void and, in such event, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or release of any claims by or against the debtor or any entity in any further proceedings involving the debtor. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing contained herein shall be construed to modify any provision of the acquisition agreement or the bid letter or any of nrg's rights and obligations that may be expressly set forth in the acquisition agreement or bid letter. 14.8 no modification of subordination rights. notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, nothing in the plan shall modify or be deemed to modify any subordination rights in favor of the holders of senior debt under the old indentures, and any distributions from the class 15c cash payment fund that, if made to the holders of old subordinated noteholder claims in accordance with section 5.13, would violate the subordination provisions of the old indentures shall be deemed automatically assigned, and shall be paid by reorganized o'brien directly, to the holders of senior debt entitled thereto in accordance with the applicable terms of the old indentures. 14.9 severability. should any provision in the plan be determined to be unenforceable, such determination shall in no way limit or affect the enforceability and operative effect of any other provisions of the plan. 41 14.10 de minimis distributions. no distribution of less than ten dollars ($10.00) in cash shall be made to any holder of an allowed claim. such undistributed amount will be the property of and released to reorganized o'brien. 14.11 interpretation and rules of construction. unless otherwise specified, all section, article, schedule and exhibit references in the plan are to the respective section in, article of, or schedule or exhibit to, the plan, as the same may be amended, waived, or modified from time to time. the rules of construction contained in section 102 of the bankruptcy code shall apply to the construction of the plan. 14.12 other terms. the words 'herein,' 'hereof,' 'hereto,' 'hereunder,' and others of similar import refer to the plan as a whole and not to any particular section, subsection, or clause contained in the plan. 14.13 headings. headings are used in the plan for convenience of reference only, and shall not constitute a part of the plan for any other purpose. headings shall not limit or otherwise affect the provisions of the plan. 14.14 incorporation of exhibits. each schedule and exhibit to the plan annexed hereto and each of the plan documents are
