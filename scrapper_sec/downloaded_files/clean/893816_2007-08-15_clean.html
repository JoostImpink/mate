source and amount of funds or other consideration on august 6, 2007, wipro, the offeror and the issuer entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#147; merger agreement &#148;), pursuant to which the offeror will merge with and into the issuer (the &#147; merger &#148;), subject to the consummation of a tender offer (the &#147; tender offer &#148;) to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, as more fully discussed in item 4 below. in addition to the merger agreement, and in connection therewith, wipro and the offeror also entered into tender and voting agreements with each of mr. robert wallach and mr. zach lonstein (each a &#147; principal stockholder &#148;), dated as of the date of the merger agreement (each a &#147; voting agreement &#148;). under the voting agreements, each principal stockholder has (i) agreed to tender and not withdraw his beneficially held shares of common stock (the &#147; shares &#148;) pursuant to the terms of the tender offer and (ii) granted certain representatives of wipro an irrevocable proxy to vote and exercise all voting and related rights with respect to the shares, including any and all other shares or securities of the issuer issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date of the voting agreement. as a result of entering into the voting agreements, each of wipro and the offeror may be deemed to have acquired the power to vote the shares in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and, consequently, shared beneficial ownership of the shares within the meaning of rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act. middle co. may be deemed to have indirectly acquired beneficial ownership of such shares by virtue of its 100% ownership of the capital stock of the offeror. neither wipro nor the offeror has paid any consideration to the stockholders in connection with the execution and delivery of the voting agreements. however, if wipro and the offeror acquire the shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the voting agreements, the value of such transaction will be $18.70 per share (or any different price per share that is paid in the tender offer), net to the holder thereof in cash without interest thereon, less any required withholding taxes. the offeror expects to fund the consideration payable for such shares through wipro&#146;s internally available cash and securities and additional cash generated from operations or through available bank loans. the foregoing description of the merger agreement and the voting agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreements. a copy of the merger agreement is attached to this filing as exhibit 1 , and copies of the voting agreements are attached to this filing as exhibit 2 and exhibit 3 . item 4: purpose of transaction as described in item 3 above, which description is incorporated into this item 4 by reference, wipro and the offeror have executed the voting agreements as part of a plan to acquire control of the issuer through the acquisition of all of the issuer&#146;s issued and outstanding common stock by means of the proposed tender offer and merger. pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the offeror intends to consummate the tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the issuer for $18.70 per share (or any different price per share that is paid in the tender offer), net to the holder thereof in cash without interest thereon, less any required withholding taxes. pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the issuer has granted the offeror an option (the &#147; top-up option &#148;) to purchase that number of shares equal to the lowest number of shares that, when added to any other shares directly or indirectly owned by wipro or the offeror at the time of such exercise, including all shares acquired in the tender offer, constitute one thousand shares more than ninety percent (90%) of the shares outstanding immediately after such exercise, at a price per share equal to the price per share paid in the tender offer. pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, and following the consummation of the tender offer and the payment for all shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock tendered pursuant thereto, the offeror will merge with and into the issuer and all then-outstanding shares of common stock (other than shares held in treasury of the issuer and shares owned directly or indirectly by wipro limited, middle co., the offeror or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $18.70 per share, net to the holder thereof in cash without interest, less any required withholding taxes. upon completion of the merger, the issuer will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of middle co. and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of wipro. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, following the acceptance for payment by the offeror pursuant to the tender offer of more than a majority of the outstanding shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock, and from time to time thereafter as such shares are acquired by wipro or the offeror, wipro shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the board of directors of the issuer as will give wipro, subject to compliance with section 14(f) of the exchange act and rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, representation on the board equal to at least that number of directors that equals the product of the total number of directors on the board (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by wipro or any affiliate of wipro bears to the total number of such shares then outstanding. the directors of the offeror immediately prior to the consummation of the merger shall be the initial directors of the surviving corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors and assigns are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. the officers of the issuer immediately prior to the consummation of the merger shall be the initial officers of the surviving corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their resignation or removal. following the merger, the issuer&#146;s shares of common stock will no longer be traded on the nasdaq global select market, there will be no public market for such shares, and the registration of such shares under the securities exchange act of 1934 will be terminated. other than as described in this item 4, wipro, middle co. and the offeror have no plans or proposals that relate to, or may result in, any of the matters listed in items 4(a)-(j) of schedule 13d. wipro, middle co. and the offeror intend to continue to review the issuer&#146;s assets, corporate structure, dividend policy, capitalization, operations, properties, policies, management and personnel, and to further consider, following consummation of the tender offer and the appointment of directors to the issuer&#146;s board of directors, whether any changes would be desirable in light of the circumstances then existing, and reserves the right to take such actions or effect such changes as it deems desirable. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) and (b) as discussed in item 3 above, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference, each of wipro and the offeror may be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of the shares in connection with the execution and delivery of the voting agreements, and middle co. may be deemed to have acquired indirect beneficial ownership of the shares by virtue of its 100% ownership of the capital stock of the offeror. the shares comprise 2,760,296 shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock, including options to purchase 1,320,450 shares exercisable within 60 days of august 6, 2007, and constitute approximately 12.4% of all issued and outstanding shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock as of august 3, 2007. therefore, by entering into the voting agreements, wipro and the offeror may be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of an aggregate of 2,760,296 shares (or approximately 12.4%) of the issuer&#146;s common stock. notwithstanding the foregoing, except as expressly provided in the voting agreements, wipro and the offeror are not entitled to any rights as stockholders of the issuer, and both entities expressly disclaim any beneficial ownership of such shares. except as set forth in this item 5(a) and (b), to the knowledge of wipro and the offeror, no person named in
