rights have been properly exercised) will be converted into the right to receive the offer price. the consummation of the merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including approval by the issuer&#146;s stockholders, if required. the foregoing description of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement, which is attached as exhibit 1 and is incorporated herein by reference. concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, and as a condition and inducement to parent&#146;s willingness to enter into the merger agreement, parent, purchaser and the issuer entered into four tender and support agreements (collectively, the &#147;support agreements&#148;) dated as of the date of the merger agreement with each of the following executive officers of the issuer (each a &#147;stockholder&#148;): &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; wes crews &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; kerry r. hicks &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; allen dodge &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; david g. hicks pursuant to each support agreement, each stockholder has agreed, among other things, subject to the termination of the support agreement (i) to tender pursuant to the offer (and not withdraw, except under certain circumstances) a portion of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by such stockholder at the commencement of the offer and not to exercise any rights of appraisal in connection with the merger, (ii) to irrevocably exercise all of such stockholder&#146;s stock options, conditioned upon the occurrence of purchaser&#146;s acceptance for payment of all shares validly tendered in the offer and not properly withdrawn, (iii) to irrevocably direct the issuer to transfer to purchaser, on such stockholder&#146;s behalf, all shares of common stock received by him in settlement of such stockholder&#146;s restricted stock, upon the net exercise of such stockholder&#146;s stock options, or otherwise, in accordance with the applicable terms of the support agreement, (iv) not to transfer any of such stockholder&#146;s equity interests in the issuer, including any shares of common stock, other than in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the support agreement, (v) not to take any action that would interfere with the performance of such stockholder&#146;s obligations under, or the transactions contemplated by, the support agreement, (vi) to vote such stockholder&#146;s shares of common stock in support of the merger in the event stockholder approval is required to consummate the merger, (vii) to vote against any action or agreement that would materially interfere with or prevent the offer or the merger, and (viii) not to solicit or initiate discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire the issuer. the support agreements will terminate upon the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement, the effective time of the merger or upon the mutual written consent of parent and each stockholder. the foregoing description of the support agreements set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the support agreements, the form of which is attached as exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by reference.&#160; the support agreements are substantially identical to the form of support agreement, other than (i) the number of shares subject to each support agreement (ii) in the support agreement with kerry r. hicks, the issuer agrees to issue, or cause to be issued, up to 1,700,000 shares of common stock to kerry r. hicks immediately after the acceptance of the offer, which shares would be subject to such support 9 agreement. in addition to common stock and restricted stock, the vested options of each stockholder are also subject to the support agreements, in an aggregate amount of 3,219,763 shares, however, the reporting persons expressly disclaim any beneficial ownership of such options because the proxy given to parent to vote such shares is contingent on the options being exercised. the proposed transaction values the equity at approximately $294 million.&#160; parent expects to fund the consideration payable by purchaser pursuant to the offer and the merger using funds from vestar and its affiliates. shared voting power with respect to the shares of common stock beneficially owned by the stockholders may be deemed to have been acquired through execution of the support agreements. schedule b lists the names and number of shares that are beneficially held by each stockholder and subject to this schedule 13d. item 4. &#160;&#160;&#160; purpose of the transaction purchaser expects to commence the offer by august 10, 2010.&#160; if the offer is consummated, purchaser will be entitled to designate a number of persons to the board of directors that reflects purchaser&#146;s proportionate voting interest in the issuer.&#160; subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions applicable to the offer after consummation of the offer, parent expects to cause the merger to be consummated.&#160; upon the consummation of the merger, (i) the issuer will become a wholly owned subsidiary of parent and (ii) each share of common stock which has not been purchased pursuant to the offer will be converted into the right to receive $8.20 in cash, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement. from and after the effective time of the merger (the &#147;effective time&#148;) and pursuant to the merger agreement, the directors of purchaser will serve as directors of the issuer, (i) unless otherwise determined by parent or purchaser prior to the effective time, the officers of the issuer immediately prior to the effective time will be the officers of the issuer, (ii) the certificate of incorporation of the issuer will be amended to conform to the certificate of incorporation of purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the effective time and, as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of the issuer as the surviving corporation and (iii) unless otherwise determined by parent or purchaser prior to the effective time, the bylaws of purchaser in effect immediately prior to the effective time will be the by-laws of the issuer. following the merger, the shares of common stock will no longer be traded on the nasdaq market, there will be no public market for the shares and registration of the shares of common stock under the securities exchange act of 1934 will be terminated. item 3 is incorporated by reference into this item 4. except as set forth in this schedule 13d and in connection with the offer and the merger described above, parent has no plan or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. &#160;&#160;&#160; interest in securities of the issuer (a) and (b) other than those shares of common stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by operation of the support agreements, the reporting persons, do not beneficially own any shares. as a result of the support agreements, parent may be deemed to have the power to vote up to 3,924,039 shares in favor of approval of the merger, and thus, each reporting person may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 3,924,039&#160; shares of common stock.&#160; all shares of common stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the reporting persons constitute approximately 12.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock and restricted stock as of july 27, 2010 (as represented by the issuer in the merger agreement). 10 the reporting persons (i) are not entitled to any rights as a stockholder of the issuer as to the shares of common stock covered by the support agreements, except as otherwise expressly provided in the support agreements and (ii) disclaims all beneficial ownership of such shares of common stock. except as set forth in this item 5(a), none of parent and, to the knowledge of the reporting persons, any persons named in schedule a beneficially owns any shares of common stock. (c) except for the agreements described in this schedule 13d, to the knowledge of the reporting persons, no transactions in the class of securities reported have been effected during the past 60 days by any person named in schedule a or item 5(a). (d) to the knowledge of the reporting persons, no other person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities of the issuer reported herein.
