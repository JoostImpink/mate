healthcare corporation, a georgia corporation (the "company"), hilltopper holding corp., a delaware corporation ("parent"), and hilltopper acquisition corp., a georgia corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("purchaser"). w i t n e s s e t h: - - - - - - - - - - whereas, the boards of directors of the company and purchaser have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective shareholders for purchaser to acquire the company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and whereas, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that purchaser will make a cash tender offer (the "offer") to acquire all shares (the "shares") of the issued and outstanding common stock, $.01 par value, of the company (the "company common stock") for $5.50 per share of company common stock or such higher price as may be paid in the offer (the "per share amount"), net to the seller in cash; and whereas, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the boards of directors of the company, purchaser and parent have each approved the merger of purchaser with and into the company (the "merger") following the offer in accordance with the georgia business corporation code (the "georgia code") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and whereas, on february 24, 2000, certain shareholders of the company (the "contributing shareholders") entered into a subscription and contribution agreement with parent and certain affiliates of parent (the "subscription agreement"), pursuant to which each such contributing shareholder has, among other things, agreed to contribute some or all of its shares to parent in exchange for shares of stock of parent upon the terms set forth in the subscription agreement; and whereas, as an inducement and a condition to parent's and purchaser's entering into this agreement, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this agreement, the contributing shareholders have entered into a voting agreement with parent and purchaser (the "voting agreement"), pursuant to which each such contributing shareholder has, among other things,(x) agreed not to tender its shares in the offer and (y) granted to parent a proxy with respect to the voting of such shares, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement; and whereas, the board of directors of the company (the "board of directors"), based on the recommendation of a special committee (the "special committee") of the board of directors comprised solely of directors unaffiliated with the contributing shareholders, has approved this agreement, the subscription agreement and the voting agreement and has determined that the consideration to be paid for each share in the offer and the merger is fair to the holders of such shares and to recommend that the holders of such shares accept the offer and approve this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the company, parent and purchaser hereby agree as follows: article i. the tender offer section 1.1. the offer. (a) provided that this agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with section 8.1 hereof and none of the events set forth in annex i hereto shall have occurred and be existing, purchaser or a direct or indirect subsidiary of parent as designated by parent shall commence (within the meaning of rule 14d-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") the offer as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this agreement, but in any event within 15 business days following the date of this agreement. the obligation of parent to accept for payment any shares tendered shall be subject to the satisfaction of those conditions set forth in annex i. parent expressly reserves the right from time to time, subject to sections 1.1(b) and 1.1(d) hereof, to waive any such condition, to increase the per share amount, or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the offer. the per share amount shall be net to the seller in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by the seller. the company agrees that no shares held by the company or any of its subsidiaries (as defined below) will be tendered pursuant to the offer. (b) without the prior written consent of the company, parent shall not (i) decrease the per share amount or change the form of consideration payable in the offer, (ii) decrease the number of shares sought, (iii) amend or waive satisfaction of the minimum condition (as defined in annex i) or (iv) impose additional conditions to the offer or amend any other term of the offer in any manner adverse to the holders of shares. upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, purchaser will accept for payment and purchase, as soon as permitted under the terms of the offer, all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer. -2- (c) the offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "offer to purchase") having only the conditions set forth in annex i hereto. as soon as practicable on the date the offer is commenced, parent and purchaser shall file with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") a tender offer statement on schedule to (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "schedule to") and, if necessary, jointly file with target a transaction statement on schedule 13e-3 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "schedule 13e-3") with respect to the offer that will comply in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable federal securities laws, and will contain (including as an exhibit) or incorporate by reference the offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (which documents, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, and any other sec schedule or form which is filed in connection with the offer and related transactions, are referred to collectively herein as the "offer documents"). parent and purchaser agree promptly to correct the schedule to and the offer documents and to cooperate with target to amend the schedule 13e-3 if and to the extent that such documents shall have become false or misleading in any material respect (and the company, with respect to written information supplied by it specifically for use in the schedule to, schedule 13e-3 or the offer documents, shall promptly notify parent of any required corrections of such information and shall cooperate with parent and purchaser with respect to correcting such information) and to supplement the information provided by it specifically for use in the schedule to, schedule 13e-3 or the offer documents to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and parent and purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the schedule to or schedule 13e-3, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the sec and the offer documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. the company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any offer documents before they are filed with the sec. (d) the offer to purchase shall provide for an initial expiration date of 20 business days (as defined in rule 14d-1 under the exchange act) from the date of commencement. purchaser agrees that it shall not terminate or withdraw the offer or extend the expiration date of the offer unless at the expiration date of the offer the conditions to the offer described in annex i hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived. if at the expiration date of the offer, the conditions to the offer described in annex i hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived, parent may, from time to time extend the expiration date of the offer until the date such conditions are satisfied or earlier waived and parent becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for shares tendered pursuant to the -3- offer, but in no event shall such extensions extend beyond the termination date (as defined below). notwithstanding the foregoing, purchaser may, without the consent of the company, (i) extend the expiration date of the offer (as it may be extended) for any period required by applicable rules and regulations of the sec in connection with an increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant to the offer and (ii) extend the expiration date of the offer (as it may be extended) for up to ten business days, if on such expiration date the conditions for the offer described on annex i hereto shall have been satisfied or earlier waived, but the number of shares that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn, when added to the shares, if any, beneficially owned by parent represents less than 90 percent of the then issued and outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. section 1.2. company action. (a) the company hereby approves of and consents to the offer and represents and warrants that the board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held on february 25, 2000, at which all of the directors were present, and acting on the unanimous recommendation of the special committee, duly and unanimously: (i) approved and adopted this agreement, the subscription agreement and the voting agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the offer and the merger; (ii) recommended that the shareholders of the company accept the offer, tender their shares pursuant to the offer and approve this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the merger; (iii) determined that this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the offer and the merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the shareholders of the company; and (iv) took all action necessary to render the limitations on business combinations contained in part 2 of article 11 of the georgia code inapplicable to this agreement, the subscription agreement and the voting agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. the company further represents and warrants that j.p. morgan securities inc. ("j.p. morgan") as financial advisor to the special committee, delivered to the special committee and the board of directors a written opinion, dated as of february 25, 2000, to the effect that the per share amount to be received by the shareholders (other than parent, purchaser and the contributing shareholders) of the company pursuant to the offer and the merger is fair to such shareholders from a financial point of view. (b) the company hereby agrees to file with the sec, as promptly as practicable after the filing by parent and purchaser of the schedule to with respect to the offer, a tender offer solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "schedule 14d-9") and the schedule 13e-3 that (i) will comply in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable federal securities laws and (ii) will include the opinion of j.p. morgan referred to in section 1.2(a) hereof. the schedule 14d-9 and the offer -4- documents shall contain the recommendations of the board of directors described in section 1.2(a) hereof. the company agrees promptly to correct the schedule 14d-9 or the schedule 13e-3 if and to the extent that it shall become false or misleading in any material respect (and each of parent and purchaser, with respect to written information supplied by it specifically for use in the schedule 14d-9 or the schedule 13e-3, shall promptly notify the company of any required corrections of such information and cooperate with the company with respect to correcting such information) and to supplement the information contained in the schedule 14d-9 or the schedule 13e-3 to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the company shall take all steps necessary to cause the schedule 14d-9 or the schedule 13e-3 as so corrected to be filed with the sec and disseminated to the company's shareholders to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the schedule 14d-9 before it is filed with the sec.

which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. -4- ex-99.3 4 voting agreement exhibit 3 execution copy voting agreement voting agreement, dated as of february 25, 2000 (the "agreement"),
