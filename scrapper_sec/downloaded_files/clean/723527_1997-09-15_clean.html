whereas, the board of directors of compuserve has determined it is in the best interests of its stockholders to consummate the merger and has adopted a resolution approving and adopting this agreement, subject to authorization by resolution of the stockholders of compuserve; whereas, the board of directors of h&r block, as sole stockholder of block group, has determined it is in the best interests of its shareholders to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement and has adopted a resolution approving and adopting the agreement; whereas, worldcom, as the sole member of wac, has approved this agreement; whereas, as a condition and inducement to worldcom's and wac's entering into this agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement, h&r block and block group are entering into a stockholder's agreement with worldcom in the form attached hereto as exhibit a (the "stockholders agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, block group has agreed to grant worldcom an irrevocable option to purchase all of the capital stock of compuserve held by block group, agreed to vote all of its compuserve common shares in favor of the merger and granted worldcom an irrevocable proxy to vote such shares; whereas, as a condition and inducement to worldcom's and wac's entering into this agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement, h&r block and block group are entering into a standstill agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit b (the "standstill agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, h&r block and block group agree to restrictions with respect to the acquisition of worldcom common shares; whereas, the parties intend that worldcom's acquisition of compuserve through the merger shall constitute a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of section 338(d)(3) of the code; and whereas, h&r block, block group, compuserve, worldcom and wac desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement and also to prescribe various conditions to the consummation thereof; now, therefore, in consideration of the premises, and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows: article i terms of the merger 1.1 the merger. upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement, the merger shall be consummated in accordance with the dgcl and the dllca. at the effective time (as defined in section 1.2 below), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, wac shall be merged with and into compuserve in accordance with the dgcl and the dllca and the separate existence of wac shall thereupon cease, and compuserve, as the surviving corporation in the merger (the "surviving corporation"), shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the state of delaware as a subsidiary of worldcom. the parties shall prepare and execute a certificate of merger (the "certificate of merger") in order to comply in all respects with the applicable requirements of the dgcl and the dllca and with the provisions of this agreement. 1.2 effective time. the merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of the certificate of merger with the secretary of state of delaware in accordance with the applicable provisions of the dgcl and the dllca or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger. the certificate of merger shall be filed as soon as practicable after all of the conditions set forth in this agreement have been satisfied or waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of the same. worldcom and compuserve shall mutually determine the time of such filing and the place where the closing of the merger (the "closing") shall occur. the time when the merger shall become effective is herein referred to as the "effective time" and the date on which the effective time occurs is herein referred to as the "closing date." 2 1.3 merger consideration. (a) (i) subject to the provisions of this agreement and any applicable backup or other withholding requirements, each of the compuserve common shares outstanding as of the effective time shall be converted into the right to receive, and there shall be paid and issued as hereinafter provided in exchange for each of the compuserve common shares, a fraction of a share of worldcom common stock equal to the exchange ratio (defined below), subject to the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional share as provided in section 1.3(b) (such share of worldcom common stock, together with such cash payment, the """merger consideration"). the "exchange ratio" shall be determined as follows: (i) if the average trading price of a worldcom common share is greater than or equal to $29.54, the exchange ratio shall equal 0.40625; (ii) if the average trading price of a worldcom common share is greater than or equal to $24.00 but less than $29.54, the exchange ratio shall equal a fraction (rounded to the nearest hundred-thousandth) determined by dividing $12.00 by the average trading price of a worldcom common share; and (iii) if the average trading price of a worldcom common share is less than $24.00, the exchange ratio shall equal 0.5. the exchange ratio shall be subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization after the date of this agreement applicable to shares of the worldcom common stock or the compuserve common stock. (ii) in order to allow the transaction contemplated by this agreement to constitute a qualified stock purchase under section 338 of the code and not a tax-free reorganization, block group shall have the right to elect to (x) reduce the aggregate merger consideration otherwise payable to block group pursuant to the merger by such number of shares of worldcom common stock the aggregate value of which, based on the average trading price, is equal to $1,100,000, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization after the date of this agreement applicable to shares of the worldcom common stock and not reflected in the average trading price, and (y) in lieu of such shares, receive $1,000,000 in cash. (b) no fractional shares of worldcom common stock shall be issued pursuant to the merger nor will any fractional share interest involved entitle the holder thereof to vote, to receive dividends or to exercise any other rights of a shareholder of worldcom. in lieu thereof, any person who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of worldcom common stock pursuant to the provisions hereof shall receive an amount in cash equal to the value of such fractional share. the value of such fractional share shall be the product of such fraction multiplied by the average trading price, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization after the date of this agreement applicable to shares of the worldcom common stock and not reflected in the average trading price. (c) each share of compuserve common stock held in the treasury of compuserve or by a wholly owned subsidiary of compuserve shall be canceled as of the effective time and no merger consideration shall be payable with respect thereto. 3 (d) subject to the provisions of this agreement, at the effective time, the interest of worldcom in wac outstanding immediately prior to the merger shall be converted, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into one share of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the surviving corporation (the """surviving corporation common stock"), which one share of the surviving corporation common stock shall constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the surviving corporation and shall be owned by worldcom. 1.4 stockholders' rights upon merger. upon consummation of the merger, the certificates which theretofore represented compuserve common shares (the """certificates") shall cease to represent any rights with respect thereto, and, subject to applicable law and this agreement, shall only represent the right to receive the merger consideration. 1.5 surrender and exchange of shares. (a) prior to the closing date, worldcom shall appoint the bank of new york or such other entity as may be serving as worldcom's transfer agent to act as exchange agent (the """exchange agent") for the merger. promptly after the effective time, worldcom shall make available, or cause to be made available, to the exchange agent such certificates evidencing such number of shares of worldcom common stock and such amount of cash, as and when necessary, in order to enable the exchange agent to effect the exchange of certificates and make the cash payment required pursuant to section 1.3(a)(ii) above if elected by block group, and the cash payments in respect of fractional shares contemplated by section 1.3(b) above. (b) on the closing date, worldcom shall instruct the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate within five business days of receiving from compuserve a list of such holders of record, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as worldcom may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for certificates representing the merger consideration. (c) after the effective time, each holder of a compuserve common share shall surrender and deliver the certificates to the exchange agent together with a duly completed and executed transmittal letter. upon such surrender and delivery, the holder shall receive a certificate representing the number of whole shares of worldcom common stock into which such holder's compuserve common shares have been converted pursuant to this agreement, subject to the cash payment required pursuant to section 1.3(a)(ii) above if elected by block group and the cash payment in lieu of any fractional share contemplated by section 1.3(b) above. until so surrendered and exchanged, each outstanding certificate after the effective time shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive that number of whole shares of worldcom common stock into which the compuserve common shares have been converted pursuant to this agreement, subject to the cash payment required pursuant to section 1.3(a)(ii) above if elected by block group and the cash payment in lieu of any fractional share contemplated by section 1.3(b) above; provided, however, that no dividends or -------- ------- other distributions, if any, in respect of the shares of worldcom common stock, declared after the 4 effective time and payable to holders of record after the effective time, shall be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered certificates until such certificates are exchanged as provided herein. subject to applicable law, after the surrender and exchange of certificates, the record holders thereof will be entitled to receive any such unpaid dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which have become payable after the effective time with respect to the number of shares of worldcom common stock for which such certificates were exchangeable. holders of any unsurrendered certificates shall not be entitled to vote worldcom common stock or exercise other rights of the holders of worldcom common stock until such certificates are exchanged pursuant to this agreement. (d) at the effective time, the stock transfer books of compuserve shall be closed, and no transfer of compuserve common shares shall be made thereafter. in the event that, after the effective time, certificates are presented to the surviving corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for shares of worldcom common stock and cash as provided in section 1.3(a)(ii) if so elected by block group and section 1.3(b) above. (e) neither compuserve nor worldcom nor the exchange agent shall be liable to any holder of compuserve common shares for any such shares of worldcom common stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law, rule, regulation, statute, order, judgment or decree. 1.6 certificate of incorporation. at and after the effective time, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be identical to the certificate of incorporation of compuserve in effect at the effective time (subject to any subsequent amendment). 1.7 bylaws. at and after the effective time, the bylaws of compuserve in effect at the effective time shall be the bylaws of the surviving

(iii) any claim of indemnification for losses and expenses which does not result from a third-party claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the party claiming a right of indemnification ("indemnitee") to the party from whom indemnification is sought ("indemnitor") specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis for the claim and the losses and expenses incurred. such indemnitor shall have a period of 30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. if the indemnitor does not respond within such 30-day period, such indemnitor shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. if such indemnitor does not respond within such 30-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, the indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party, under applicable law or under this agreement. (iv) if the amount of any losses and expenses shall, at any time subsequent to the payment required by this agreement, be reduced by recovery, settlement, insurance proceeds or otherwise, the amount of such reduction, less any expenses incurred in connection therewith, shall promptly be repaid by the indemnitee to the indemnitor.

(a) the parties intend that the acquisition of compuserve by worldcom through the merger will constitute a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of section 338(d)(3) of the code. in order to effectuate such intent: (i) block group acknowledges that pursuant to the terms of this agreement, as a consequence of the merger it has the right to receive in exchange for its shares of compuserve common stock either (a) shares of worldcom common stock or (b) both shares of worldcom common stock and cash, as provided in section 1.3(a)(ii) above, in either case subject to receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in section 1.3(b) above. in order to allow the transaction contemplated by this agreement to constitute a qualified stock purchase under section 338 of the code and not a tax-free reorganization, by executing this agreement block group hereby elects to receive both shares of worldcom common stock and cash, as provided in section 1.3(a)(ii), and agrees that such election shall be irrevocable. (ii) h&r block (as the common parent of the selling consolidated group within the meaning of section 338(h)(10) of the code), worldcom and compuserve shall jointly make timely and irrevocable elections under section 338(h)(10) of the code (which elections shall be made with respect to the compuserve and each of the eligible compuserve entities requested by worldcom) and, if permissible, similar elections under any applicable state, local or foreign income tax laws (jointly, the "elections"). h&r block and worldcom agree to report the transfer of the compuserve common shares (and the deemed sale of the shares of the affected compuserve entities) under this agreement consistent with such election and agree not to take any action that could cause such election to be invalid, and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a determination (as defined in section 1313(a) of the code or any similar state, local or foreign tax provision). (b) (i) to the extent possible, worldcom, h&r block, and compuserve agree to execute at the closing any and all forms necessary to effectuate the election (including internal revenue service form 8023-a and any similar forms under applicable state, local and foreign income tax laws (the "section 338 forms")). in the event, however, any section 338 forms are not executed at the closing, worldcom, h&r block and compuserve agree to prepare and complete each such section 338 form no later than 10 business days prior to the date such section 338 form is required to be filed. h&r block and worldcom shall each cause the section 338 forms to be duly executed by an authorized person for h&r block and worldcom, in each case, and shall duly and timely file the section 338 forms in accordance with applicable tax laws and the terms of this agreement. 52 (ii) as soon as practicable after the closing date, worldcom shall deliver to h&r block a written notice setting forth (with reasonable specificity) worldcom's good faith calculation of (1) the modified aggregate deemed sales price (as defined below) and the allocation thereof among the assets of compuserve and of the affected compuserve entities in accordance with the principles of treasury regulation (s)1.338(h)(10)- 1(f)(1)(ii) and (2) the adjusted grossed-up basis of the assets of compuserve and of the assets of the affected compuserve entities pursuant to treasury regulation (s)1.338(h)(10) - 1(e)(5) (the "deemed purchase price") (collectively, "buyer's allocation"). within 20 business days after receipt thereof, h&r block shall deliver to worldcom written notice indicating whether h&r block agrees or disagrees with buyer's allocation. if h&r block agrees with buyer's allocation or if h&r block fails to deliver such written notice within such 20 business days, buyer's allocation shall constitute the "agreed allocation." if h&r block provides timely written notice to worldcom of any disagreement with buyer's allocation, the agreed allocation shall be determined through the tax settlement procedure. except as determined to the contrary by the appropriate taxing authority upon an audit of its (or its affiliates') tax returns, each of h&r block, compuserve, the affected compuserve entities and worldcom shall file all tax returns consistent with the agreed allocation. for purposes of this section 9.1, the term "modified aggregate deemed sales price" shall mean the amount resulting from the elections, determined pursuant to treasury regulation (s)1.338(h)(10)-1(f) without regard to items described in treasury regulation (s)1.338(h)(10)- 1(f)(4)(ii) (it being understood that h&r block may take such items into account in filing tax returns). (c) for purposes of this agreement, the "tax settlement procedure" is as follows: upon receipt by h&r block or by worldcom, as the case may be (the "calculating party"), of notice from the other party (the "disputing party") of disagreement with any tax calculation or determination supplied by the calculating party, the calculating party and the disputing party shall begin good faith negotiations to resolve such disagreement. if the calculating party and the disputing party are able to resolve such disagreement within ten business days after the calculating party's receipt of notice of disagreement (or any longer period mutually agreed to by the parties), the relevant amount will become the amount agreed upon by the calculating party and the disputing party. if the calculating party and the disputing party are unable to resolve any disagreement within ten (10) business days after the calculating party's receipt of notice of disagreement, the calculating party and the disputing party shall jointly request the national office of arthur andersen llp, or, if such firm is unavailable, another independent nationally recognized auditing firm selected by the parties (the "tax settlement auditor") to resolve any issue in dispute as soon as possible and shall cooperate with the tax settlement auditor to resolve such dispute. the tax settlement auditor shall make a determination with respect to all disputed issues, which determination shall be set forth in a written report delivered to the calculating party and the disputing party. the calculating party and the disputing party shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the tax settlement auditor with respect to such determination. 53 9.2 tax indemnification. (a) h&r block and the h&r block entities (other than compuserve and the compuserve entities) jointly and severally shall be responsible for, shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify and hold harmless worldcom and wac and, after the closing, compuserve and the compuserve entities (subject to the obligations of compuserve and the compuserve entities to make payments under section 9.2(j)) and each of their respective successors- in-interest from and against any and all losses and expenses for or in respect of each of the following: (i) any and all taxes with respect to any taxable period of compuserve or any of the compuserve entities (or any predecessor) ending on or before the closing date (including any and all taxes arising as a result of the elections), but excluding any transactions occurring after the closing (other than the elections) which are not related to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by this agreement ("excluded transactions"); (ii) any and all taxes resulting from compuserve or any of the compuserve entities (or any predecessor) having been (or ceasing to be) included in any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary tax return that included compuserve or any of the compuserve entities (or any predecessor) for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the closing date (including any liability for taxes resulting from an acceleration of an "intercompany transaction" within the meaning of treasury regulation (s)1.1502-13(d), any deferred income triggered by treasury regulation (s)1.1502-14, and any excess loss accounts taken into income under treasury regulation (s)1.1502-19 or any analogous or similar provisions under state, local or foreign law or any predecessor provision or regulation) that occurred on or before the closing date (but excluding the excluded transactions); (iii) any and all taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group (other than compuserve or any compuserve entity) of which compuserve or any compuserve entity (or any predecessor) is or was a member on or prior to the closing date, by reason of the liability of compuserve or any compuserve entity (i) pursuant to treasury regulation (s)1.1502-6(a) or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or regulation, (ii) as a transferee or successor, or (iii) by contract or otherwise (including under any tax sharing, tax indemnity, tax allocation or similar contracts (whether or not written) to which compuserve or any of the compuserve entities, any predecessor of compuserve or any of the compuserve entities, or any transferor to compuserve or any of the compuserve entities, is a party or is obligated thereunder; (iv) any and all employment and withholding taxes with respect to all periods prior to and as of the closing date; (v) to the extent not previously paid, any and all real property taxes allocable to compuserve or any compuserve entity (or any predecessor) pursuant to section 9.2(c) hereof (excluding real property taxes resulting from the excluded transactions 54 and any increase in real property taxes arising from a revaluation of the property as a result of the sale of the compuserve common shares or the elections); (vi) any and all taxes allocable to h&r block, compuserve or any compuserve entity pursuant to section 9.2(c) hereof and not previously paid thereunder; and (vii) any breach of any representation or warranty contained in section 3.10 or of any covenant of h&r block or any other h&r block entity contained in section 9.2. (b) worldcom agrees to indemnify and hold harmless h&r block and the other h&r block entities from and against (and h&r block and the other h&r block entities shall have no liability under section 9.2(a) on account of) any and all losses and expenses for or in respect of any and all taxes of compuserve or any of the compuserve entities (or any predecessor) that are not described in section 9.2(a) (including taxes resulting from an excluded transaction). (c) h&r block and worldcom shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, elect with the relevant taxing authority to close the taxable period of compuserve and the compuserve entities on the closing date. in any case where applicable law does not permit compuserve or any compuserve entity to close its taxable year on the closing date (and in the case of taxes described in section 9.2(a)(v)), taxes attributable to the taxable period of compuserve or any compuserve entity beginning on or before and ending after the closing date shall be allocated (i) to h&r block for the period up to and including the closing date (excluding any excluded transaction and any increase in real property taxes arising from a revaluation of the property as a result of the merger or the elections), and (ii) to worldcom, compuserve or any compuserve entity, as appropriate, for the period subsequent to the closing date (including any excluded transaction and any increase in real property taxes arising from a revaluation of the property as a result of the merger or the elections). any allocation required to determine any taxes attributable to any period beginning on or before and ending after the closing date (including any taxes resulting from a tax audit or administrative or court proceeding) shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of compuserve and the compuserve entities as of the close of business on the closing date, excluding any excluded transaction, and, to the extent not susceptible to such allocation, by apportionment on the basis of elapsed days, except that extraordinary items described in treasury regulation (s)1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(c) shall be allocated to the day that they are taken into account. real property taxes (excluding those arising from any excluded transaction and any increase in such taxes arising from a revaluation of the property as a result of the merger or the elections) shall be allocated on the basis of elapsed days. (d) (i) promptly after receipt by worldcom, wac, compuserve or any of the compuserve entities of written notice of the assertion or commencement of any claim, audit, examination, or other proposed change or adjustment by any taxing authority concerning any tax covered by section 9.2(a) (each a "tax claim"), worldcom shall notify h&r block. such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known by 55 worldcom, compuserve or any of the compuserve entities) describing the asserted tax claim in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted tax claim. the failure of worldcom to give h&r block prompt notice as provided herein shall not relieve h&r block of any of its obligations under section 9.2, except and only to the extent that h&r block is materially prejudiced by such failure. (ii) h&r block shall promptly notify worldcom of the commencement of any claim, audit, examination or other proposed change or adjustment by any taxing authority which could reasonably be expected to affect the liability of compuserve or any of the compuserve entities for taxes. such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known by h&r block or any h&r block entities) describing the asserted tax claim in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted tax claim. the failure of h&r block to give worldcom prompt notice as provided herein shall not relieve worldcom of any of its obligations under section 9.2, except and only to the extent that worldcom or any of the worldcom entities (including compuserve and any of the compuserve entities) is materially prejudiced by such failure. (iii) h&r block shall have the sole right to represent compuserve's or any of the compuserve entities' interests in any tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any tax covered by section 9.2(a) and to employ counsel of its choice, provided that if the results of such tax audit or proceeding could reasonably be expected to be material to worldcom, compuserve, any of the compuserve entities or their affiliates for any taxable period including or ending after the closing date, then h&r block and worldcom shall jointly control the defense and settlement of any such tax audit or proceeding and each party shall cooperate with the other party at its own expense and there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, for a tax audit or proceeding with respect to any seller consolidated and combined return, worldcom shall only be entitled to participate actively with respect to those issues as to which they have an interest and not control jointly the settlement of the entire audit. h&r block shall promptly notify worldcom if it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any such tax audit or administrative or court proceeding and worldcom thereupon shall be permitted to defend and settle such tax audit or proceeding.

(g) any claim for indemnity hereunder may be made at any time prior to 60 business days after the expiration of the applicable tax statute of limitations with respect to the relevant taxable period (including all extensions obtained, whether automatic or permissive).

(a) h&r block and worldcom agree that any indemnity payment made under this agreement shall be treated by the parties on their tax returns as an adjustment to the exchange ratio. if, notwithstanding such treatment by the parties, any indemnity payment is determined to be taxable to (i) h&r block (other than as an adjustment to the exchange ratio) or (ii) worldcom, wac, compuserve or any compuserve entity, for federal income tax purposes by the irs, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party for any additional federal income taxes payable by the indemnified party by reason of the receipt or accrual of such indemnity payment (including any payments under this section 9.3). (b) an indemnity payment otherwise due and payable hereunder shall be decreased (but not below zero) to the extent of any net actual reduction in federal income tax liability that is actually realized by the indemnified party at the time of its payment of an indemnifiable loss.

(b) indemnification by worldcom. worldcom and, from and after the closing, ans hereby agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless aol and each aol entity and each of their respective designees, successors in interest and assigns and each of their respective past and current directors, officers, employees, consultants, representatives and agents (the "aol indemnified parties") from and against any losses and expenses (or, in the case of losses and expenses relating to any representation, warranty or covenant incorporated herein pursuant to section 4.8 hereof, 80.1% of such losses and expenses) which are based on, arise out of or relate to, directly or indirectly, (i) the conduct by worldcom or the worldcom entities of the business of ans, the ans entities or the ans network services business after the closing, or any liability in respect of matters referred to in schedule 8.4(b) to the compuserve agreement; (ii) the conduct by worldcom or the worldcom entities of compuserve's businesses other than the compuserve online services business after the closing; (iii) any breach of the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in sections 4.6 and 4.7 hereof or sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.14, 3.17, 3.18, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 8.2, 8.3, 8.6, 8.7, 8.10 or 8.14 of the compuserve agreement to the extent incorporated herein under section 4.8; (iv) any breach of any other representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of worldcom or any worldcom entity herein (other than those incorporated by reference under section 4.8), without regard to any qualification as to materiality stated herein or in the compuserve agreement (including any reference to material, material, material adverse change or material adverse effect in this agreement or in the compuserve agreement), if and to the extent that the aggregate of all losses and expenses related to or arising out of all breaches (other than with respect to an intentional breach of any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as to which no dollar threshold shall apply) described in this clause (iv) exceeds $10 million; (v) any breach of any other representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of worldcom or any worldcom entity to the extent incorporated by reference herein under section 4.8, without regard to any qualification as to materiality stated herein or in the compuserve agreement (including any reference to material, material, material adverse change or material adverse effect in this agreement or in the compuserve agreement), if and to the extent that 80.1% of the aggregate of all losses and expenses related to or arising out of all breaches (other than with respect to an intentional breach of any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as to which no dollar threshold shall apply) described in this clause (v) exceeds $10 million; or (vi) any action, claim or proceeding brought in connection with the enforcement of the foregoing 32 clauses; provided, that, in connection with any claim made hereunder in respect of which worldcom may have a corresponding claim against block or its affiliates under the compuserve agreement, aol shall cooperate with and assist worldcom (with worldcom being responsible for the payment of any related out-of-pocket expenses) reasonably incurred by aol in connection with any such claims. (c) notification of claims. for the purpose of this section 5.2, the term "indemnifying party" shall mean the party having an obligation hereunder to indemnify the other party or parties pursuant to this section 5.2, and the term "indemnified party" shall mean the party having the right to be indemnified pursuant to this section 5.2. whenever any claim shall arise for indemnification under this section 5.2, the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of such claim and, promptly after becoming known, the facts constituting the basis for such claim (in reasonable detail). failure by the indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability hereunder unless and only to the extent such failure prejudices the indemnifying party. the worldcom indemnified parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under section 5.2(a)(iv) and the aol indemnified parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under section 5.2(b)(iii) unless, prior to march 15, 1999, a worldcom indemnified party has notified aol, or an aol indemnified party has notified worldcom, as the case may be, in writing in reasonable detail of the existence of any losses and expenses that may reasonably be expected to give rise to any such indemnification obligation. notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, any claim for indemnification related to or arising out of any ans tax matter set forth in section 6.2(a) and section 6.2(b) shall be governed solely by section 6.2 hereof, any claim for indemnification related to or arising out of any compuserve tax matter incorporated based on sections 9.2(a) and 9.2(b) to the extent incorporated by reference herein by section 4.8 shall be governed by the same procedures as set forth in section 9.2 of the compuserve agreement, substituting worldcom for block and aol for worldcom. (d) indemnification procedures. (i) after the giving of notice by an indemnified party as required by paragraph (c) of any claim or the commencement of any action by a person or governmental entity who is not a party to this agreement or an affiliate of such a party (a "third-party claim"), if the indemnifying party undertakes to defend any such claim, it shall be required to take control of the defense and investigation with respect to such claim and to employ and engage reputable attorneys of its own choice reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party to handle and defend the same, at the indemnifying party's cost, risk and expense, upon written notice to the indemnified party of such election, which notice acknowledges the indemnifying party's obligation to provide indemnification hereunder. the indemnifying party shall not settle any third-party claim that is the subject of indemnification without the written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. the indemnified party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the indemnifying party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of any lawsuit or action with respect to such claim and any appeal arising therefrom (including the filing in the indemnified 33 party's name of appropriate crossclaims and counterclaims). in connection with any third-party claim, each indemnified party shall use reasonable efforts to make available to the indemnifying party upon written request and at reasonable times, its and its subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees and agents to act as witnesses to the extent that such persons may reasonably be required to be available in connection with any claim under this section 5.2. the indemnified party may, at its own cost, participate in any investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action controlled by the indemnifying party and any appeal arising therefrom. if there are one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party that conflict with those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right, at the expense of the indemnifying party, to assume the defense of the lawsuit or action; provided, however, that the indemnified party may not settle such lawsuit or action without the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (d)(i), if a third-party claim is for money damages asserted in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000 and is principally for non-monetary relief that would have a continuing material adverse effect on the indemnified party, then the indemnified party shall be entitled to take control of the defense and investigation with respect to such claim and to employ and engage reputable attorneys of its own choice reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party to handle and defend the same, at the indemnifying party's cost, risk and expense, upon written notice to the indemnifying party of such election. (ii) if, within a reasonable time following receipt of a notice of a third-party claim pursuant to paragraph (d), the indemnifying party does not undertake to defend any such claim, the indemnified party may, but shall have no obligation to, contest at the expense of the indemnifying party to the extent provided in this section 5.2 any lawsuit or action with respect to such claim and the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party (including the settlement thereof without the consent of the indemnifying party). (iii) any claim of indemnification for losses and expenses which does not result from a third-party claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the party claiming a right of indemnification ("indemnitee") to the party from whom indemnification is sought ("indemnitor") specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis for the claim and the losses and expenses incurred. such indemnitor shall have a period of 30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. if the indemnitor does not respond within such 30-day period, such indemnitor shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. if such indemnitor does not respond within such 30-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, the indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party, under applicable law or under this agreement. (iv) if the amount of any losses and expenses shall, at any time subsequent to the payment required by this agreement, be reduced by recovery, settlement, insurance 34 proceeds or otherwise, the amount of such reduction, less any expenses incurred in connection therewith, shall promptly be repaid by the indemnitee to the indemnitor. (e) tax-related adjustment. an indemnity payment otherwise due and payable hereunder (i) shall be decreased (but not below zero) to the extent of any net actual reduction in federal income tax liability that is actually realized by the indemnified party at the time of its payment of an indemnifiable loss and (ii) shall be increased to indemnify the indemnified party for any additional federal income taxes payable by the indemnified party by reason of the receipt or accrual of such indemnity payment. 5.3 no contribution. aol, for itself and on behalf of the aol entities, waives, and acknowledges and agrees that it and they will not have and will not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of subrogation, right of indemnity or other similar right or remedy against ans and the ans entities with respect to any action or failure to act by any aol entity, including ans and the ans entities, occurring prior to the effective time in connection with any actual or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation or agreement set forth in this agreement or any losses or expenses referred to in section 5.2 or section 6.2. 5.4 access to information. subject to the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, between the date hereof and the closing date, each of aol and worldcom and their respective entities shall (i) give to each such other party and its counsel, accountants and other representatives reasonable access, at reasonable times and after reasonable notice, to all the properties, documents, contracts, personnel files (subject to applicable law) and other records of such party reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) furnish the other party with copies of such documents and with such information with respect to the affairs of such party as the other party may from time to time reasonably request; and (iii) shall disclose and make available to each such party and its representatives all books, contracts, accounts, personnel records, letters of intent, papers, records, communications with regulatory authorities and other documents relating to the business and operations of such party, to the extent appropriate to aol's and worldcom's respective interests in the transactions contemplated hereby. nothing contained in this section 5.4 shall be deemed to create any duty or responsibility on the part of either party to investigate or evaluate the value, validity or enforceability of any contract, lease or other asset included in the assets of the other party. with respect to matters as to which any party has made express representations or warranties herein, the parties shall be entitled to rely upon such express representations and warranties without regard to any investigations made by such parties. none of the parties hereto shall have any liability to any other party hereto resulting from the sharing with such other party of any information obtained in the course of the due diligence review by the parties relating to compuserve, the compuserve entities or the compuserve assets, or resulting from any inaccuracy in any such information. 5.5 confidentiality. aol and worldcom acknowledge and confirm that they have entered into a letter agreement dated august 14, 1997 by and among aol, worldcom and compuserve (the "confidentiality agreement") and that the confidentiality agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, notwithstanding aol's and 35 worldcom's entering into this agreement and whether or not the transactions contemplated by this agreement are consummated or terminated. 5.6 hsr act compliance, etc. (a) aol and worldcom shall promptly make their respective filings, and shall thereafter use their best efforts to promptly make any required submissions, under the hsr act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. aol and worldcom shall use their respective reasonable efforts to promptly make all other required submissions with respect to all other permits, authorizations, consents and approvals from third parties and governmental entities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement.

(a) neither aol nor ans shall, nor shall aol permit any aol entity or authorize or permit any officer, director or employee, investment banker, attorney, agent or other advisor or representative of any of them to (i) initiate, solicit, or encourage, directly or indirectly, the submission of, any ans competitive proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person or entity any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate knowingly the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an ans competitive proposal. for purposes of this agreement, an "ans competitive proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of all or a significant part of the stock or assets of ans or any ans entity or of the ans network services business or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving ans or any ans entity, other than the transactions contemplated by this agreement.

(c) immediately upon the execution of this agreement, aol and ans shall cease any ongoing discussions or negotiations with any parties previously conducted with respect to any actual or potential ans competitive proposal and request each person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an ans competitive proposal to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of aol or ans. (d) worldcom shall not, nor shall it permit any worldcom entity or authorize or permit any officer, director or employee, investment banker, attorney, agent or other advisor or representative of any of them to (i) initiate, solicit, or encourage, directly or indirectly, the submission of, any worldcom competitive proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate knowingly the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a worldcom competitive proposal. for purposes of this agreement, a "worldcom competitive proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of all or a significant part of the compuserve online services business, other than worldcom's indirect acquisition thereof pursuant to the compuserve agreement.

such prior service credited under a worldcom benefit program shall include service with other entities to the extent that such service is credited by ans or any aol entity for purposes of any ans benefit plan similar to such worldcom benefit plan. notwithstanding the preceding sentence, worldcom may continue (or cause ans to continue after the closing) the participation by ans employees in one or more of the ans benefit plans, and worldcom will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this section 5.13(b) with respect to the type of benefits provided under such ans benefit plan(s). 5.14 ans name. aol acknowledges that the name "ans," whether alone or in combination with one or more other words, will be an asset solely of ans or the ans entities immediately following the closing. nothing in this agreement shall reserve a license or constitute a retention or transfer of rights in or with respect to the word "ans" to aol or any other person (except ans and the ans entities) after the closing and neither aol nor any such other person acting by or through any grant or right from aol shall use or purport to use, license or otherwise transfer the word "ans" for any business purpose after the closing. following the closing, aol agrees to take all actions and to execute all documents and certificates as worldcom may reasonably request to effectuate the intention of this section 5.14. 5.15 compuserve name. worldcom and aol are entering into an agreement contemporaneously with the signing of this agreement (the "agreement to form business entity"), providing that both worldcom and aol shall form an entity to hold, maintain, license and defend rights to the use of the compuserve name, with worldcom and its affiliates having rights of use in the network services business, and with aol and its affiliates having rights of use in the online services business. 39 5.16 noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreement. subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to its obligations in article vii, below, aol shall execute and deliver to worldcom at closing, without further consideration, an agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as exhibit e (the "noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreement"). 5.17 key-employee nondisclosure and nonsolicitation agreements. aol shall use its best efforts to obtain, at or prior to the closing, duly executed nondisclosure and nonsolicitation agreements in substantially the form attached as exhibit f (the "key employee agreements") (unless signed prior to the execution of this agreement) from the significant employees, officers and directors of ans and the ans entities designated by worldcom in writing. 5.18 board seat. promptly after the effective time, worldcom shall cause the current chief executive officer of aol, if he so requests within thirty days after the date hereof, to be appointed to the board of directors of worldcom. 5.19 services agreements. aol and worldcom shall execute and deliver to each other at the closing (a) a services agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as exhibit g (the "transition services agreement") and (b) network services agreements in substantially the forms attached hereto as exhibits h and i (the "network services agreements"). 5.20 status of title to the compuserve assets. worldcom and the worldcom entities shall not cause any lien, encumbrance or other defect in title to any of the compuserve assets to be created prior to the transfer thereof to aol or its designee or designees at the closing. 5.21 delivery of ans shares. aol shall deliver the ans shares, at the closing, to worldcom (or to compuserve if directed by worldcom) free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances. 5.22 consummation of merger. worldcom shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to closing under the compuserve agreement to be satisfied, including the exercise of proxy or option rights which may be granted to worldcom in connection with the compuserve agreement;

negotiation period. in the event that worldcom becomes entitled to exercise the option (the "option") granted to it pursuant to the stockholders agreement (as such term is defined in the compuserve agreement), worldcom and aol shall negotiate with each other in good faith, for so long as the option remains exercisable and , if the option is exercised by worldcom, for 180 days following such exercise (the "negotiation period") with the goal of entering into agreements and arrangements and engaging in transactions which would, as closely as would be commercially reasonable at that time and in accordance with applicable law (and taking into account the changed facts and circumstances as they exist at that time), effectuate the intent and purposes of this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. during the negotiation period, aol and worldcom shall each comply with the provisions of sections 5.4 and 5.10. article vi tax matters 6.1 section 338 election. (a) the parties intend that the acquisition of ans by worldcom will constitute a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of section 338(d)(3) of the code. at the request of worldcom, aol (as the common parent of the selling consolidated group within the meaning of section 338(h)(10) of the code), worldcom, and ans shall jointly make timely and irrevocable elections under section 338(h)(10) of the code (which elections shall be made with respect to ans and each of the eligible ans entities requested by worldcom) and, if permissible, similar elections under any applicable state, local or foreign income tax laws (jointly, the "elections"). to the extent worldcom has requested an election, aol agrees to report the transfer of ans shares (and the deemed sale of the shares of the affected ans entities) under this agreement consistent with such election and agrees not to take any action that could cause such election to be invalid, and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a determination (as defined in section 1313(a) of the code or any similar state, local or foreign tax provision). (b) to the extent worldcom has requested an election: (i) to the extent possible, worldcom, aol, and ans agree to execute at the closing any and all forms necessary to effectuate the election (including internal revenue service form 8023-a and any similar forms under applicable state, local or foreign income tax laws (the "section 338 forms")). in the event, however, any section 338 forms are not executed at the closing, worldcom, aol and ans agree to prepare and complete each such section 338 form no later than ten (10) business days prior to the date such section 338 form is required to be filed. aol and worldcom shall each cause the section 338 forms to be duly executed by an authorized person for aol and worldcom, in each case, and shall duly and timely file the section 338 forms in accordance with applicable tax laws and the terms of this agreement. (ii) as soon as practicable after the closing date, worldcom shall deliver to aol a written notice setting forth (with reasonable specificity) 41 worldcom's good faith calculation of (1) the modified aggregate deemed sales price (as defined below) and the allocation thereof among the assets of ans and of the affected ans entities in accordance with the principles of treasury regulation (s) 1.338(h)(10)-1(f)(1)(ii) and (2) the adjusted grossed-up basis of the assets of ans and of the assets of the affected ans entities pursuant to treasury regulation (s) 1.338(h)(10)-1(e)(5) (the "deemed purchase price") (collectively, "buyer's allocation"). within 20 business days after receipt thereof, aol shall deliver to worldcom written notice indicating whether aol agrees or disagrees with buyer's allocation. if aol agrees with buyer's allocation or if aol fails to deliver such written notice within such 20 business days, buyer's allocation shall constitute the "agreed allocation." if aol provides timely written notice to worldcom of any disagreement with buyer's allocation, the agreed allocation shall be determined through the tax settlement procedure. except as determined to the contrary by the appropriate taxing authority upon an audit of its (or its affiliates') tax returns, each of aol, ans and the affected ans entities shall file all tax returns consistent with the agreed allocation. for purposes of this section 6.1, the term "modified aggregate deemed sales price" shall mean the amount resulting from the elections, determined pursuant to treasury regulation (s) 1.338(h)(10)-1(f) without regard to items described in treasury regulation (s) 1.338(h)(10)- 1(f)(4)(ii) (it being understood that aol may take such items into account in filing tax returns). (c) for purposes of this agreement, the "tax settlement procedure" is as follows: upon receipt by aol or by worldcom, as the case may be (the "calculating party"), of notice from the other party (the "disputing party") of disagreement with any tax calculation or determination supplied by the calculating party, the calculating party and the disputing party shall begin good faith negotiations to resolve such disagreement. if the calculating party and the disputing party are able to resolve such disagreement within ten (10) business days after the calculating party's receipt of notice of disagreement (or any longer period mutually agreed to by the parties), the relevant amount will become the amount agreed upon by the calculating party and the disputing party. if the calculating party and the disputing party are unable to resolve any disagreement within ten (10) business days after the calculating party's receipt of notice of disagreement, the calculating party and the disputing party shall jointly request the tax settlement auditor referred to below to resolve any issue in dispute as soon as possible and shall cooperate with the tax settlement auditor to resolve such dispute. the tax settlement auditor shall be the national office of price waterhouse; provided that if, price waterhouse shall, at the time, be serving as the independent public accountants of either worldcom or aol or shall otherwise have a material relationship with either of them, then the tax settlement auditor shall be the national office of kpmg peat marwick, or, if kpmg peat marwick shall have such a material relationship, the national office of another accounting firm mutually satisfactory to worldcom and aol. the tax settlement auditor shall make a determination with respect to all disputed issues, which determination shall be set forth in a written report delivered to the calculating party and the disputing party. the calculating party and the disputing party shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the tax settlement auditor with respect to such determination. 42 6.2 tax indemnification. (a) aol and the aol entities (other than ans and the ans entities) jointly and severally shall be responsible for, shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify and hold harmless worldcom and any worldcom affiliates and, after the closing, ans and the ans entities and each of their respective successors-in-interest from and against any and all losses and expenses for or in respect of each of the following: (i) any and all taxes with respect to any taxable period of ans or any of the ans entities (or any predecessor) ending on or before the closing date (including any and all taxes arising as a result of the elections), but excluding any transactions occurring after the closing (other than the elections) which are not related to the transfer of ans shares and the other transactions contemplated by this agreement ("excluded transactions"); (ii) any and all taxes resulting from ans or any of the ans entities (or any predecessor) having been (or ceasing to be) included in any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary tax return that included ans or any of the ans entities (or any predecessor) for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the closing date (including any liability for taxes resulting from an acceleration of an "intercompany transaction" within the meaning of treasury regulation (s) 1.1502-13(d), any deferred income triggered by treasury regulation (s) 1.1502-14, and any excess loss accounts taken into income under treasury regulation (s) 1.1502-19 or any analogous or similar provisions under state, local or foreign law or any predecessor provision or regulation) that occurred on or before the closing date (but excluding the excluded transactions); (iii) any and all taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group (other than ans or any ans entity) of which ans or any ans entity (or any predecessor) is or was a member on or prior to the closing date, by reason of the liability of ans or any ans entity (i) pursuant to treasury regulation (s) 1.1502-6(a) or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or regulation, (ii) as a transferee or successor, or (iii) by contract or otherwise (including under any tax sharing, tax indemnity, tax allocation or similar contracts (whether or not written) to which ans or any of the ans entities, any predecessor of ans or any of the ans entities, or any transferor to ans or any of the ans entities, is a party or is obligated thereunder; (iv) any and all employment and withholding taxes; (v) to the extent not previously paid, any and all real property taxes allocable to ans or any ans entity (or any predecessor) pursuant to section 6.2(c) hereof (excluding real property taxes resulting from the excluded transactions and any increase in real property taxes arising from a revaluation of the property as a result of the sale of ans shares or the elections); (vi) any and all taxes allocable to aol, ans or any ans entity pursuant to section 6.2(c) hereof and not previously paid thereunder; and 43 (vii) any breach by aol or any aol entity of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in section 3.10 or section 6.2.

(c) aol and worldcom shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, elect with the relevant taxing authority to close the taxable period of ans and the ans entities on the closing date. in any case where applicable law does not permit ans or any ans entity to close its taxable year on the closing date (and in the case of taxes described in section 6.2(a)(v)), taxes attributable to the taxable period of ans or a ans entity beginning on or before and ending after the closing date shall be allocated (i) to aol for the period up to and including the closing date (excluding any excluded transaction and any increase in real property taxes arising from a revaluation of the property as a result of the sale of ans shares or the elections), and (ii) to worldcom for the period subsequent to the closing date (including any excluded transaction and any increase in real property taxes arising from a revaluation of the property as a result of the sale of ans shares or the elections). any allocation required to determine any taxes attributable to any period beginning on or before and ending after the closing date (including any taxes resulting from a tax audit or administrative or court proceeding) shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of ans and the ans entities as of the close of business on the closing date, excluding any excluded transaction, and, to the extent not susceptible to such allocation, by apportionment on the basis of elapsed days, except that extraordinary items described in treasury regulation (s) 1.1502- 76(b)(2)(ii)(c) shall be allocated to the day that they are taken into account. real property taxes (excluding those arising from any excluded transaction and any increase in such taxes arising from a revaluation of the property as a result of the sale of ans shares or the elections) shall be allocated on the basis of elapsed days. (d) (i) promptly after receipt by worldcom, ans or any of the ans entities of written notice of the assertion or commencement of any claim, audit, examination, or other proposed change or adjustment by any taxing authority concerning any tax covered by section 6.2(a) (each a "tax claim"), worldcom shall notify aol. such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known by worldcom, ans or any of the ans entities) describing the asserted tax claim in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted tax claim. the failure of worldcom to give aol prompt notice as provided herein shall not relieve aol of any of its obligations under section 6.2, except to the extent that aol is materially prejudiced by such failure. 44 (ii) aol shall promptly notify worldcom of the commencement of any claim, audit, examination or other proposed change or adjustment by any taxing authority which could reasonably be expected to affect the liability of ans or any of the ans entities for taxes. such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known by aol or any aol entity) describing the asserted tax claim in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted tax claim. the failure of aol to give worldcom prompt notice as provided herein shall not relieve worldcom of any of its obligations under section 6.2, except and only to the extent that worldcom or any of the worldcom entities (including ans and any of the ans entities) is materially prejudiced by such failure. (iii) aol shall have the sole right to represent ans's or any of the ans entities' interests in any tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any tax covered by section 6.2(a) and to employ counsel of its choice, provided that (a) with respect to any taxable period referred to in sections 6.2(a)(v) or (vi) hereof or ending after the closing date or (b) if the results of such tax audit or proceeding could reasonably be expected to be material to worldcom, ans, or their affiliates for any taxable period including or ending after the closing date, then aol and worldcom shall jointly control the defense and settlement of any such tax audit or proceeding and each party shall cooperate with the other party at its own expense and there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld provided; however, for a tax audit or proceeding with respect to any seller consolidated and combined return, worldcom shall only be entitled to participate actively with respect to those issues as to which they have an interest and not control jointly the settlement of the entire audit. aol shall promptly notify worldcom if it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any such tax audit or administrative or court proceeding and worldcom thereupon shall be permitted to defend and settle such tax audit or proceeding. (e) (i) aol shall properly prepare or cause to be properly prepared, and shall timely file or cause to be timely filed, (x) all tax returns which include ans or any ans entities required to be filed on or before the closing date, and (y) all tax returns which include ans or any ans entities or their assets or operations for all taxable periods of ans and of the ans entities ending on or before the closing date (which tax returns shall include ans and the ans entities and the reportable items from the assets or operations of ans and the ans entities through and including the closing date). such tax returns (insofar as they relate to ans or any of the ans entities) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices and prior audit adjustments and aol shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes shown as due on such tax returns or otherwise levied or assessed upon ans or any of the ans entities or any of their assets on or prior to the closing date. insofar as they relate to ans and the ans entities, such tax returns shall be provided to worldcom for worldcom's review and comment 20 business days prior to filing, and worldcom shall be entitled to suggest to aol any reasonable changes to such tax returns, which suggestions may be 45 rejected by aol in its discretion. any disagreement between the parties will be resolved through the tax settlement procedure. aol shall, subsequent to the closing date, provide written notice to aol of its intent to file any amended tax return or claim for refund with respect to any taxable period ending on or prior to the closing date that could reasonably be expected to be material to worldcom, ans, or their affiliates for any taxable period including or ending after the closing date, and aol shall not make such filing without the consent of worldcom, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (ii) except as set forth in clause (i) above, worldcom shall be responsible for the filing and payment (subject to worldcom's right to indemnification to the extent provided in section 6.2(a)) of all other tax returns required to be filed after the closing date by or on behalf of ans and any of the ans entities, or with respect to their assets and operations. worldcom shall, subsequent to the closing date, provide written notice to aol of its intent to file any amended tax return that could reasonably be expected to be material to aol, and worldcom shall not make such filing without the consent of aol, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(g) any claim for indemnity hereunder may be made at any time prior to 60 business days after the expiration of the applicable tax statute of limitations with respect to the relevant taxable period (including all extensions obtained, whether automatic or permissive). (h) the party seeking indemnification or other payment pursuant to this section 6.2 shall give the other party written notice of claim for indemnification or payment, which notice shall include a calculation of the amount of the requested indemnity or other payment and shall furnish to the other party copies of all books, records and other information reasonably requested by the other party to the extent necessary to substantiate such claim and verify the amount thereof. if reasonably necessary in order to make or substantiate a claim (or to determine if a claim should be made), each party shall be permitted access to the other party's books, records and other information in connection therewith. the party requested to make any indemnity or other payment pursuant to this section 6.2 shall deliver to the party requesting payment, within 20 business days after receiving both the foregoing notice and all books, records and other information reasonably requested by it, a detailed statement describing its objections (if any) thereto. any such objections will be resolved through the tax settlement procedure.

(a) aol and worldcom agree that any indemnity payment made under this agreement shall be treated by the parties on their tax returns as an adjustment to the purchase price. if, notwithstanding such treatment by the parties, any indemnity payment is determined to be taxable to (i) aol (other than as an adjustment to the 47 purchase price) or (ii) worldcom, ans or any ans entity, for federal income tax purposes by the irs, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party for any additional federal income taxes payable by the indemnified party by reason of the receipt or accrual of such indemnity payment (including any payments under this section 6.3). (b) an indemnity payment otherwise due and payable hereunder shall be decreased (but not below zero) to the extent of any net actual reduction in federal income tax liability that is actually realized by the indemnified party at the time of its payment of an indemnifiable loss. (c) except as provided in section 6.3(d), worldcom shall pay to aol, any refund of any tax for which aol is responsible under section 6.2(a) other than as a result of a carryback of any credit or deduction from a taxable year ending after the closing date. worldcom shall pay to aol such refund (including interest received thereon) (reduced by any actual tax increase or actual tax detriment to worldcom, ans or any of the ans entities as a result of the receipt thereof, but increased by any actual tax benefit resulting from such payment) promptly upon receipt thereof by the recipient thereof. worldcom shall, if aol requests, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refunds or equivalent amounts to which aol is entitled under this section 6.3(c), and worldcom shall permit aol to principally control the prosecution of any such refund claim, provided, however, that worldcom must consent to any such refund claim, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, and that any such refund claim shall be at the sole expense of the aol. (d) aol agrees that to the extent that ans or any of the ans entities realizes any tax attribute after the closing date that either is required to be or optionally may be carried back to a taxable period ending on or prior to the closing date, aol shall, at worldcom's sole expense, permit such carryback, shall cooperate in the filing of any required returns or claims for refund and shall pay worldcom any tax refund received (including interest received thereon) (reduced by any actual tax increase or tax detriment to aol as a result of the receipt thereof but incurred by any actual tax benefit resulting from such payment) or the amount of any reduction in taxes so obtained by the seller group (as hereinafter defined); provided, however, in the event that any tax attribute generated after the closing date by worldcom, ans or any ans entity or any member of any affiliated group (or other group filing on a combined basis) of which any thereof is a member (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as a "buyer group member") is carried back to a taxable year (or portion thereof) of aol's affiliated group (or other group filing on a combined basis of which ans or any of the ans entities is a member) (the "seller group") that ended on or prior to the closing date and, as a result of such carryback, any tax attribute generated by the seller group (whether in the same year or in a prior or subsequent year) is not capable of being carried back or forward to the same extent it would have been had no such buyer group carryback occurred, such refund to worldcom shall be reduced by an amount sufficient to place the seller group in the same position as it would have been in if no such carryback occurred (except that aol shall pay worldcom (when and as actually realized) any refund of taxes or actual reduction of taxes otherwise payable by the seller group that is subsequently realized by the seller group as a result of the seller group's use of any tax attributes that would otherwise have been utilized 48 by the seller group earlier had the tax attribute of worldcom, ans or any ans entity (or any other buyer group member) not been so carried back. 6.4 transfer taxes. all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the effectuation of the transfer of ans shares and the ans network assets to worldcom shall be paid by aol when due; and all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the effectuation of the transfer of the compuserve assets to aol or its designee or designees shall be paid by worldcom when due. the party obligated to pay such taxes and fees shall, at its own expense, file all necessary tax returns and other documentation with respect to the applicable transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other taxes and fees. if required by applicable law, worldcom and aol will, and will cause their affiliates to, join in the execution of any such tax returns and other documentation prepared by the other. article vii conditions to closing 7.1 mutual conditions. the respective obligations of each party to consummate the purchase and sale and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the satisfaction, at or prior to the closing date, of the following conditions: (a) any mandatory waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the purchase and sale under the hsr act shall have expired or been terminated.
