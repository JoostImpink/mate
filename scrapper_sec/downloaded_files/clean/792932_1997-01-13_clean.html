terms and conditions: (1) claims by non-parties. the indemnified party shall give written notice within a reasonably prompt period of time to the indemnifying party of any written claim by a third party which is likely to give rise to a claim by the indemnified party against the indemnifying party based on the indemnity agreements contained in this article, stating the nature of said claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known. the indemnified party shall give notice to the indemnifying party that pursuant to the indemnity, the indemnified party is asserting against the indemnifying party a claim with respect to a potential loss from the third party claim, and such notice shall 33 39 constitute the assertion of a claim for indemnity by the indemnified party. if, within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice, the indemnifying party advises the indemnified party that it will provide indemnification and assume the defense at its expense, then so long as such defense is being conducted, the indemnified party shall not settle or admit liability with respect to the claim and shall afford to the indemnifying party and defending counsel reasonable assistance in defending against the claim. if the indemnifying party assumes the defense, counsel shall be selected by such party and if the indemnified party then retains its own counsel, it shall do so at its own expense. if the indemnified party does not receive a written objection to the notice from the indemnifying party within thirty (30) days after the indemnifying party's receipt of such notice, the claim for indemnity shall be conclusively presumed to have been assented to and approved, and in such case the indemnified party may control the defense of the matter or case and, at its sole discretion, settle or admit liability. if within the aforesaid thirty (30) day period the indemnified party shall have received written objection to a claim (which written objection shall briefly describe the basis of the objection to the claim or the amount thereof, all in good faith), then for a period of ten (10) days after receipt of such objection the parties shall attempt to settle the dispute as between the

subsequent to the transaction effective date will be the responsibility of either parent or shareholder in accordance with the following guidelines: (i) if it is a claim in which the incident giving rise to liability clearly arose prior to the transaction effective date, shareholder shall respond to the loss and defense expenses; (ii) if it is a claim in which the incident giving rise to liability clearly arose on or after the transaction effective date, parent shall respond to the loss and defense expenses; and (iii) in the event that the incident giving rise to liability as to time is not clear, shareholder and parent will jointly defend the case and each will fully cooperate with the other in such defense. once the case is closed, if parent and shareholder cannot agree to the allocation of both indemnity and expenses, then the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration in los angeles california in accordance with the rules and procedures of the american arbitration association. notwithstanding anything seemingly to the contrary contained herein, no indemnification shall be made hereunder until agreed to by the parties hereto or settled in arbitration. 13.5 indemnity period. the representations, warranties and covenants, and the indemnity obligations related thereto, under this agreement shall expire 24 months from the closing, except for claims under sections 4.13 and 4.28 hereof, which shall expire upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and except for claims under sections 4.9 or 4.25 hereof, which shall expire on the earlier of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or 48 months from closing. the indemnification obligations under this agreement shall not expire as provided herein for a claim made, but not resolved, within the above periods. 13.6 limitation on claims. the limitations provided in this section 13.6 apply solely to the liability of the shareholder. the obligations of an indemnifying party under this agreement shall not begin until the indemnified party incurs one or more liabilities which equal two hundred thousand and no/100 dollars ($200,000.00) (the "basket"). once the basket is reached, the obligations of an indemnifying party under this agreement shall apply to all claims of the indemnified party, whether such claims are part of the basket or in excess thereof. in no event shall the obligations of an indemnifying party and its affiliates under this agreement exceed four million dollars ($4,000,000.00) (the "cap"). notwithstanding the foregoing, the

health care operation or business which provides any goods or services competitive with the goods and services provided by the business as of the closing, 35 41 or (b) solicit for employment or employ any person who at closing or thereafter became an employee of parent, surviving corporation or an affiliate unless such person is not so employed for at least six (6) months, or (c) with respect to any customer, patient, physician, physician group, or healthcare provider with whom parent, surviving corporation and/or an affiliate contracts with in connection with the business, either solicit the same in a manner which could adversely affect parent, surviving corporation or an affiliate, or make statements to the same which disparage parent, surviving corporation, an affiliate or their respective operations in any way. the "non-compete period" shall commence at the closing and terminate on the third anniversary thereof. the "non-compete area" shall mean the area within a fifty (50) mile radius of each location from which the business or the related business is operated or conducted as of the closing. ownership of less than five percent (5%) of the stock of a publicly held company shall not be deemed a breach of this covenant. 14.2 enforceability. in the event of a breach of paragraph 14.1, shareholder recognizes that monetary damages shall be inadequate to compensate parent and surviving corporation, and parent and surviving corporation shall be entitled, without the posting of a bond or similar security and notwithstanding the arbitration provisions contained in article xiii, to an injunction restraining such breach, with the costs (including attorney's fees) of securing such injunction to be borne by shareholder. nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting parent or surviving corporation from pursuing any other remedy available to either for such breach or threatened breach. all parties hereby acknowledge the necessity of protection against the competition of shareholder and that the nature and scope of such protection has been carefully considered by the parties. the period provided and the area covered are expressly represented and agreed to be fair, reasonable and necessary. the consideration provided for herein is deemed to be sufficient and adequate to compensate shareholder for agreeing to the restrictions contained in paragraph 14.1. if, however, any court determines that the forgoing restrictions are not reasonable, such restrictions shall be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of their nature and scope as will render them enforceable. article xv. miscellaneous 15.1 assignment. following closing, parent and surviving corporation may freely assign any or all of their respective rights or delegate any or all of their respective obligations under this agreement without the express written consent of shareholder; provided however that parent shall remain primarily liable with regard to
