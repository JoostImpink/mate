(b) an option to purchase up to 900,000 432444.2 cusip no. ________ page 5 of 10 (declining to 200,000 over time) shares of common stock; and (c) options to purchase additional shares of common stock representing one-half of the number of shares subject to any incentive stock options granted as of the equity investment closing by the company to certain optionholders, exercisable when and if such incentive stock options are exercised (the "plan options"). however, the reporting persons, for a period of four years from the consummation of the equity investment, may not acquire more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock without the approval of the directors elected by the holders of common stock. the source of funds for virgil williams' portion of the equity investment was an existing unsecured line of credit with nationsbank of georgia, n.a. and the source of funds for james williams' portion was a draw on his margin account at morgan stanley & co. a copy of the line of credit promissory note is filed herewith as exhibit 99.4. each share of preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of common stock (provided that the correlating warrant (as defined below) for such share of preferred stock has not been exercised). if a redemption occurs on or after the seventh anniversary of the equity investment closing then each share of preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder, into the "adjusted number" of shares of common stock (provided that the correlating warrant for such share of preferred stock has not been exercised); provided that as a result of such conversion (together with any simultaneous conversions) all shares issuable pursuant to the warrant have been issued. the "adjusted number" will be an amount equal to the total number of shares of preferred stock being converted multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is the exercise price then in effect and the numerator of which is the original issue price. in no event will shares of preferred stock be convertible into a number of shares of common stock that is greater than the total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to the warrant, taking into account all prior and simultaneous conversions and exercises under the warrant. upon any such conversion, the correlating warrant for each such share of preferred stock so converted will be automatically cancelled, and each such correlating warrant will be delivered, automatically cancelled and of no further force or effect. to the extent that any shares of preferred stock remain outstanding after such time as the warrant has either expired or been fully exercised, such shares of preferred stock will retain all rights granted to such preferred stock under the restated articles of incorporation of the company ("restated articles") except for the right to convert. in connection with the securities purchase agreement, at the equity investment closing, the reporting persons received warrants to purchase 963,398 shares of common stock (the "warrant") pursuant to the warrant agreement by and between the company and the reporting persons, which will expire upon the earlier to occur of (i) the time when it has been exercised with respect to all shares of common stock which the reporting persons are or may become entitled to purchase, (ii) the time when shares of preferred stock have been converted into the maximum number of shares of common stock into which such shares of preferred stock may be converted, or (iii) twelve (12) years from the date of issuance ("issuance date"). each warrant will correlate directly with one share of preferred stock acquired by the reporting persons pursuant to the securities purchase agreement (each warrant, a "correlating warrant"). the warrant is exercisable at a price per share of common stock ("exercise price") of an amount per share equal to $10,000,000 divided by the number of shares of preferred stock purchased by the reporting persons under the securities purchase agreement (the "original issue price") (calculated as of may 6, 1997, this price is $10.38 per share if the warrant is exercised on or before june 30, 1998). if the warrant is exercised after june 30, 1998 and on or before december 31, 2000 (the "exercise date"), then the exercise price will be determined as follows: (i) if the company meets or exceeds certain quarterly financial goals as determined by the board and set forth in the amended bylaws of the company (collectively, "benchmarks") for the period commencing on the first day of the fiscal quarter immediately following the fiscal quarter in which the issuance date occurs and ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the exercise date (the "relevant period"), the exercise price will be equal to the original issue price, (ii) if the company meets 60% or less of the cumulative benchmarks for the relevant period, the exercise price will be $.01, or (iii) if the company meets more than 60% but less than 100% of the cumulative benchmarks for the relevant period, the exercise price will be prorated on a straight-line basis between $.01 and the original issue price accordingly. (for example, with the original issue price of $10.38 if the company meets 90% of the cumulative benchmarks for the relevant period, the exercise price would be $7.79.) if the exercise date is after december 31, 2000, the exercise price will be 432444.2 cusip no. ________ page 6 of 10 determined as set forth above, except that the relevant period will be the period commencing on the first day of the fiscal quarter immediately following the fiscal quarter in which the issuance date occurs and ending on december 31, 2000. upon the exercise of the warrant, the shares of common stock issued upon such exercise will be subject to the restrictions set forth in the preferred shareholder agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as exhibit 99.2, and otherwise be subject to the provisions of the restated articles and the amended bylaws of the company. item 4. purpose of transaction the reporting persons currently intend to hold the shares for investment. (a) the reporting persons have no definite plans to acquire additional securities. however, over a period of several years, the option described in item 3 above declines in terms of the number of shares that may be acquired upon exercise, and the exercise price increases. the first adjustment to the number of shares and the exercise price occurs in july 1998. although the purchase of additional shares does not appear attractive to the reporting persons at the date of this schedule 13d, if the company achieves certain anticipated financial goals, the reporting persons anticipate that they may exercise the option and acquire shares of common stock. (b) none. (c) none. (d) certain material rights that are granted to the reporting persons pursuant to the securities purchase agreement are summarized below. board participation rights. pursuant to and concurrently with the equity investment closing, the reporting persons were entitled to designate for appointment six directors (or one less than a majority of the board if the board is smaller or larger than thirteen (13) members) while the holders of the common stock will elect six (6) directors (the "common stock directors"). in addition, the reporting persons had the right to approve one director nominee submitted by the common stock directors, such approval not being unreasonably withheld. thereafter, the holders of a majority of the outstanding preferred stock will be entitled to appoint six directors or the number of directors necessary to maintain a similar ratio of the total members of the board (the "preferred directors") and to approve one director nominee submitted by the common stock directors (the "swing director"), such approval not being unreasonably withheld. as long as shares of preferred stock are outstanding, the board will consist of at least nine (9) members. effective upon the equity investment closing, andrew j. young, james i. dangar, clarence d. zimmerman, fredrick j. krishon and geoffrey j. brice, current members of the board, resigned and bruce c. coles, robert b. fooshee, walter t. kiser, clay e. sams, peter d. brettell and frank b. lockridge, current members of the board, were elected to remain on the board as the common stock directors. the reporting persons have appointed virgil r. williams, james m. williams, jr., steven muller, thomas d. moreland, michael d. williams and joe a. mason, who serve as the preferred directors. the common stock directors have nominated, and the preferred directors have approved, john y. williams (no relationship to virgil r. williams and james m. williams, jr.) to serve as the seventh director ("swing director"). 432444.2 cusip no. ________ page 7 of 10 appointment of additional directors. after consummation of the equity investment, if the company (a) fails to meet 80% of certain predetermined financial performance criteria ("benchmarks") for any four consecutive fiscal quarters;
