matters, vote all of their shares of common stock in proportion to the votes cast by the holders of shares of common stock not owned by the shareholder group. notwithstanding the above restrictions,

(b) the members of the shareholder group shall, and hereby agree, severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the company, its directors, officers, employees and controlling persons, if any, and each underwriter, its partners, officers, directors, employees and controlling persons, if any, in any offering or sale of registrable shares, against any claims to which each such indemnified party may become subject, insofar as such claims (including any amounts paid in settlement as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference 20 therein, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by the shareholder group expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the company for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the company in connection with investigating or defending any such claim. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under section 5.6(a) or section 5.6(b) of written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding for which indemnification under section 5.6(a) or section 5.6(b) may be requested, such indemnified party shall notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action or proceeding; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party in respect of such action or proceeding hereunder unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by such failure of the indemnified party to give such notice, and in no event shall such omission relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability it may have to such indemnified party. in case any such action or proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall determine, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that (i) if the indemnifying party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or proceeding within 20 days after receiving notice from such indemnified party that the indemnified party believes it has failed to do so; (ii) if such indemnified party who is a defendant in any action or proceeding which is also brought against the indemnifying party reasonably shall have concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party which are not available to the indemnifying party; or (iii) if representation of both parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, then, in any such case, the indemnified party shall have the right to assume or continue its own defense as set forth above (but with no more than one firm of counsel for all indemnified parties in each jurisdiction) and the indemnifying party shall be liable for any expenses therefor (including, without limitation, any such reasonable counsel's fees). if the indemnifying party is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim, it will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for each indemnified party with respect to such claim. the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, compromise or consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement agreement with respect to any action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought under section 5.6(a) or section 5.6(b) (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party thereto), unless such compromise, consent or settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation, does not subject the indemnified party to any material injunc- 21 tive relief or other material equitable remedy and does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party. (d) the members of the shareholder group and the company agree that if, for any reason, the indemnification provisions contemplated by sections 5.6(a) or 5.6(b) hereof are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any claims referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of, the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to such offering of securities. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. if, however, the allocation in the second preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative faults, but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this section 5.6(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the preceding sentences of this section 5.6(d). the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the claims referred to above shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in section 5.6(c) hereof) any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. section 5.7 purchase right.
