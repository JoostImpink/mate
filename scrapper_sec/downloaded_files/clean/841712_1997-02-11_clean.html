obligation to acquire the subject shares shall terminate. 3 3.3 payment of purchase price. the purchase price will be paid to wri in cash in full at closing. 3.4 closing. 3.4.1 time, place and manner of closing . unless this agreement has otherwise been terminated, the closing (the "purchase closing") will be held on the effective date of the plan of reorganization, but in no event earlier than january 3, 1997, or such earlier date as agreed to by allsup. at the purchase closing, the parties to this agreement will exchange certificates and other instruments and documents in order to determine whether the terms and conditions of this agreement have been satisfied. upon such determination, and upon payment of the purchase price, wri shall issue to allsup the certificate(s)

the subject shares is terminated as provided in section 3.2 above, the letter of credit shall be released to allsup. 3.5 piggyback registration. 3.5.1 allsup's right to require registration. at such time that wri proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act (other than a registration effected solely to implement an employee benefit plan, a transaction to which rule 145 of the commission is applicable or any other form or type of registration in which shares of wri held by allsup ("registrable securities") cannot be included pursuant to commission rule of practice), wri will give written notice to allsup of such intention to register any of the securities of the wri. if such registration is proposed to be on a form which permits inclusion of the registrable securities, upon the written request (stating the intended method of disposition of such securities) of allsup, wri will, subject to the limits contained in this section 3.5.1, use its best efforts to cause all such registrable securities of allsup to be registered under the securities act and qualified for sale under certain state blue sky laws, all to the extent requisite to permit such sale or other disposition by allsup of the registrable securities so registered. notwithstanding the above, however, if the underwriter managing such registration notifies allsup in writing that market or economic conditions limit the amount of securities which may reasonably 4 be expected to be sold, allsup will be allowed to register its registrable securities pro rata based on the aggregate number of shares of securities being registered in the applicable registration. 3.5.2 registration procedures. if and whenever wri is required by the provisions of this section 3.5 to use its best efforts to effect the registration of any of its securities under the securities act, wri will, as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the period of at least ninety (90) days; (b) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply with the

to sell or otherwise disclose of the same, but only to the extent provided in this section 3.5; (c) furnish to each seller such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents, as such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the securities owned by such seller; (d) use every reasonable effort to register or qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or state blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as wri's board of directors may reasonably determine, and do any and all other acts and things which may be necessary under such securities or blue sky laws to enable such seller to consummate the public sale or other disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities owned by such seller, provided, however, that in no event shall wri be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not at the time so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process of suits other than those arising out of the offer or sale of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement in any jurisdiction where it is not at the time so subject; (e) before filing the registration statement or prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto, furnish to one counsel selected by the 5 holders of registrable securities copies of such documents proposed to be filed which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of such counsel; and (f) furnish to each prospective seller a signed counterpart, addressed to the prospective seller, of (i) an opinion of counsel for wri, dated the effective date of the registration statement, and (ii) a "comfort" letter signed by the independent public accountants who have certified wri's financial statements included in the registration statement, covering substantially the same matters with respect to the registration statement (and the prospectus included therein) and (in the case of the accountants' letter) with respect to events subsequent to the date of financial statements, as are customarily covered (at the time of such registration) in opinions of wri's counsel and in accountants' letter delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities. provided, however, notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement, wri shall not in any event be required to use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration statement for a period in excess of ninety (90) days (or at the request of the selling holders, an additional 90 days). 3.5.3 expenses. wri shall pay for the following listed expenses incurred in effecting the registration provided for in this section 3.5, namely expenses for: (a) registration and filing fees, (b) printing expenses, (c) underwriting expenses other than fees,

section 3.5.2(d) hereof, (e) wri's legal fees, and (f) legal fees of allsup; all of which expenses (which specifically exclude allsup's broker's fees) are hereinafter referred to as "registration expenses". allsup shall pay the fees and expenses of its own legal counsel, brokerage commissions and other expenses which are not specifically included in the definition of registration expenses.

or any other statute or at common law, insofar as such liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained, on the effective date thereof, in any registration statement under which such securities are registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) any alleged omission 6 to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section 3.5.6, wri shall reimburse each such indemnified person in connection with investigating or defending any such liability; provided, however, that

use therein; and provided further, that wri shall not be required to indemnify any person against any liability arising from any untrue or misleading statement or omission contained in any preliminary prospectus if such deficiency is corrected in the final prospectus, or for any liability which arises out of the failure of any person to deliver a prospectus as required by the act, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such indemnified person and shall survive transfer of such securities by allsup.

paragraphs (a) or (b) of this 7 section 3.5.6, the person claiming indemnification under such paragraphs shall promptly notify the person against whom indemnification is sought of such complaint, notice, claim or action, and such indemnifying person shall have the right to investigate and defend any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. the person claiming indemnification shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the person against whom indemnification is sought (unless the indemnifying party fails to promptly defend, in which case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the person against whom indemnification is sought). in no event shall a person against whom indemnification is sought be obligated to indemnify any person for any settlement of any claim or action effected without the indemnifying persons' prior written consent. 3.5.7 termination of registration. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 3.5, the rights to registration and the designation of allsup's
