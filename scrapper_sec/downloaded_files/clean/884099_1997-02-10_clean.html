provided that shares of restricted stock purchased by the founders on the date hereof which are unvested shall be counted as if held by the shareholders. if any holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the underwriter. any securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration. notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of registrable securities may waive the rights of all holders under this section 1.6 to include shares in a registration; provided that such waiver shall apply equally and with the same affect on all holders. in determining the total number of such shares of registrable securities outstanding and the number of such shares consenting or not consenting, all shares previously disposed of by the holders or their respective transferees pursuant to one or more registration statements under the securities act or pursuant to rule 144 or rule 701 thereunder, shall be excluded. any such waiver effected in accordance with this section shall be binding upon each holder and the company. 1.7 form s-3 registration rights. after the company's initial registered underwritten public offering, the company shall use its best efforts to qualify for registration on form s-3, and to that end the company shall use its best efforts to comply with the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "securities exchange act"), within 6. twelve (12) months following the effective date of the first registration of any securities of the company for an underwritten registered public offering. after the company has qualified for the use of form s-3, and subject to the provisions of section 1.14, each holder shall have the right to request a registration on form s-3 (such requests shall be in writing and shall state the number of shares of registrable securities to be disposed of and the intended method of disposition of such shares by each such holder), subject only to the following limitations: (a) the company shall not be obligated to cause a registration on form s-3 to become effective prior to one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of a company initiated registration (other than a registration effected solely to qualify an employee benefit plan or to effect a business combination pursuant to rule 145);

(iii) for purposes of subparagraph (ii) of section 2(a) above, the investor shall be deemed to have realized as of the date the determination is being made ("determination date") the "irr" that is obtained by solving for irr in the formula below: x ___ \ [investment amount\t\ x (1+irr)/n/\t\] = (company value x investor percentage) + option proceeds /__ t=1 "company value" shall reflect the market capitalization of the company and shall be determined as follows: (a) prior to the first underwritten public offering of securities by the company (the "ipo"), company value shall be calculated by multiplying 15 by net income for the preceding four quarters ending on the determination date. net income shall be calculated after taxes, on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and adjusted for payment of any bonuses to be paid with respect to the four quarter period. (b) after the company's ipo, company value shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of common equivalents outstanding on the determination date calculated on a fully-diluted basis, assuming full conversion or exercise of all then outstanding convertible securities, options and warrants by (ii) the market price for the company's common stock calculated as follows: (a) if the company's common stock is traded on a securities exchange, including the nasdaq national market system, the average closing price for the company's common stock on such exchange for the nine trading 8. days following the second business day after the company issues its earnings release for the quarter; or (b) if the company's common stock is traded over-the-counter, the average closing bid price for the company's common stock for the nine trading days following the second business day after the company issues its earnings release for the quarter.

"option proceeds" means the amount payable to the investor by cfsc upon exercise of the cfsc option pursuant to the agreement to purchase preferred stock. "n" means, with respect to each investment, the number of years elapsed from the date of such investment through the determination date, with partial years expressed as a decimal value, n shall be calculated by dividing (i) the total number of days elapsed from the date of each such investment by (ii) 365. thus, it would equal 2.21 (807 9. divided by 365) if the determination date were september 30, 1995 after an investment date of july 15, 1993.
