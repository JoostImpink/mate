upon the consummation of any such sale, secured party shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold. secured party may solicit offers to buy the collateral, or any part of it, from a limited number of investors deemed by secured party, in its commercially reasonable judgment, to meet the requirements to purchase securities under regulation d promulgated under the securities act (or any other regulation of similar import). if secured party solicits such offers from such investors, then the acceptance by secured party of

registration of any securities constituting collateral under the securities act or other applicable law is required or desirable in connection with any foreclosure sale, each debtor will use its best efforts to assist and cooperate in all respects reasonably requested by secured party or newco group in causing such registration to become effective and to be kept effective for such time as may be
