(b) if the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to any indemnified party or insufficient to hold any indemnified party harmless, then the company will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such transactional loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and any indemnified party, on the other, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged 23 24 untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, the company or such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any transactional losses will be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any action, suit or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this paragraph were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (c) the provisions of this section 4.12 will survive notwithstanding any termination hereof or the closing of any of the transactions contemplated hereby. (d) the indemnity, contribution and expense reimbursement obligation of the company in this agreement will be in addition to any liability the company may otherwise have. the obligations of the company to each indemnified party will be separate obligations, and the liability of the company to any indemnified party will not be extinguished solely because any other indemnified party is not entitled to indemnity or contribution hereunder. 4.13. board attendance, etc. (a) from the date hereof to the closing, the company will notify the purchaser at least 48 hours (or, if shorter, when a general notice is given pursuant to the by-laws) in advance of every meeting of the board (or any committee thereof) and will permit a representative of the purchaser to attend, as an observer, such meeting (including, at the option of the purchaser, by telephone); provided, however, that (i) if, in the opinion of the chairman of the board of the company, the board is required to deliberate as to a matter involving an actual and material conflict of interest between purchaser, on the one hand, and the company on the other hand, the chairman may exclude such observer from that portion of any meeting relating to such matter but only if no action is taken with respect to any other matter during such observer's absence, and (ii) the purchaser will not be deemed to have such a conflict of interest in respect of a proposal by another person or entity to acquire control of the company, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise (a "third-party takeover bid") unless and until the purchaser informs the company that it or any of its affiliates has determined to make a proposal to acquire control of the company, whether by tender or exchange offer, by merger, consolidation or otherwise (a "purchaser takeover bid"). 24 25 (b) in the event that, prior to the closing date, the board determines in good faith, based upon the advice of outside counsel as to legal matters, that its fiduciary duties require it to consider a third-party takeover bid, then the company will immediately notify the purchaser thereof and afford the purchaser a reasonable opportunity (not less than five business days) to consider whether to make a purchaser takeover bid in response thereto. if the purchaser (or an affiliate thereof) submits a purchaser takeover bid that provides substantially equivalent or higher value to the shareholders of the company (other than the purchaser and its affiliates) than a third-party takeover bid which the board otherwise proposes to authorize the company to accept, the company will, unless prohibited by law, accept the purchaser's takeover bid without any subsequent rounds of bidding and the purchaser's takeover bid will not be terminable by the company in the event of a subsequent third party takeover bid. (c) notwithstanding any other term or provision hereof, nothing in this section 4.13 will affect the parties' respective obligations in respect of the purchase and sale of the shares and warrant provided for herein whether or not a third-party takeover bid shall have been made. 4.14. listing. without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, the company will use its best efforts to cause the shares and the warrant shares to be eligible for trading on nasdaq or, if nasdaq fails or declines to approve the shares or the warrant shares to be so eligible for trading or otherwise acts so that the common stock is not so eligible for such trading (whether prior to or after the closing), to cause all of the company's common stock, including the shares and the warrant shares, to be listed for trading on the american stock exchange or such other exchange as the board may determine to be appropriate. 4.15. certain rights offerings. in the event that the company determines to seek to raise additional equity capital during the 18-month period immediately following the closing, the company agrees that it will use its best efforts to raise such equity capital through one or more rights offerings to the holders of common stock. subject to the limitations of the standstill agreement (if applicable), in any such rights offering, the purchaser will exercise all rights to purchase common stock distributed to it and, if the rights offered are not assignable, the purchaser will purchase from the company, on the same terms as those governing the rights offering, all shares of common stock not purchased by distributees of rights, provided, however, that the purchaser will not be obligated to pay more than $30.0 million pursuant to this section 4.15. 25 26 v. conditions to closing ------------------------ 5.1. closing to obligations of the company. the obligations of the company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement are subject to the fulfillment, at or prior to the closing, or each of the following conditions: (a) representations, warranties and covenants. the representations and warranties of the purchaser contained in this agreement shall have been true and correct when made and shall be true and correct in all material respects (other than those qualified by material adverse effect, which shall be true and correct in all respects) as of the closing, with the same force and effect as if made as of the closing, other than such representations and warranties as are made as of another date (which shall be true and correct as of the other date), and the covenants and agreements contained in this agreement to be complied with by the purchaser as of or before the closing date shall have been complied with in all material respects.

(a georgia corporation) this certifies that mei holdings, l.p., a delaware limited partnership (together with its permitted successors and assigns, the "holder"), is entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock, without par value (the "common stock"), of mountasia entertainment international, inc., a georgia corporation (the "corporation"), specified by the provisions and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. this warrant is granted pursuant to the investment agreement, by and between the corporation and the holder, dated june 5, 1996 ("investment agreement"). 1. automatic exercise. the right represented by this warrant will be deemed automatically exercised under the occurrence of any dilutive issuance (as defined in section 2 below) without any notice being given or other action being taken by the holder. the holder will not be required to pay any consideration in connection with any such automatic exercise of this warrant (other than that paid prior to the date hereof). the corporation covenants that holder will become treated for all purposes as the holder of record of the shares issued as a result of any such automatic exercise commencing as of the close of business on the date of the dilutive issuance causing such automatic exercise, and that, within ten calendar days after such date, certificates causing of common stock will be delivered by the corporation to the holder. 2. exercisability; number of shares. (a) this warrant will be deemed to have been exercised by the holder upon any conversion or exchange of any security outstanding on the date hereof, or any exercise of any warrant, option or other right outstanding on the date hereof (other than this warrant), for a consideration (as defined below) of less than the trigger price as defined below). all such convertible or exchangeable securities, warrants, options or rights are hereinafter called the "subject securities" and each such issuance in accordance with the terms thereof for a consideration below the trigger price is hereinafter called a "dilutive issuance". as used herein, "consideration" includes the amount of any cash, other property (valued at its current fair market value), principal amount of indebtedness, liquidation value of preferred or senior securities, or other consideration to be paid or surrendered to the corporation in connection with any such conversion, exchange or exercise. the corporation represents and warrants that, as of the date hereof, schedule a hereto contains a true and complete list of all subject securities. 1 2 (b) the number of shares which the holder shall receive ("new shares") in connection with any dilutive issuance will be determined by the application of the following formula: tc tc holder shares new shares = ( ---- - ------------- ) x ------------------ sp trigger price outstanding shares in which: tc = the total amount of consideration received by the corporation for such dilutive issuance; sp = the consideration per share received by the corporation for such dilutive issuance; trigger price = 130% of the amount equal to (i) $40,000,000 divided by (ii) the number of shares of common stock purchased by the holder pursuant to the investment agreement at the closing thereunder. holder shares = the total number of shares of common stock owned by the holder immediately after the closing under the investment agreement, plus (i) the total number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to this warrant and (ii) all shares of common stock received by holder in any stock split, stock dividend or other distribution on any such shares; and outstanding shares = the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the date immediately prior to the record date of such dilutive issuance. 3. adjustments. the trigger price, the number of holder shares, and the number and kind of shares receivable pursuant to this warrant ("warrant shares") will be subject to adjustment as follows: (a) if the corporation (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on the common stock in shares of common stock or shares of the capital stock other than common stock, (ii) subdivides the outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares of common stock, (iii) combines the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock, or (iv) issues any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the common stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the company is the continuing or surviving corporation), then, immediately after the determination date (as defined below) with respect to such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or issuance in a reclassification, the number and kind of shares issuable hereunder upon exercise of this warrant after a subsequent dilutive issuance will be equitably adjusted so that after such time the holder will be entitled to receive following any dilutive shares a number of shares of common stock recomputed properly to give effect to such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or issuance. 2 3 (b) for purposes of this warrant, "determination date" means (i) with respect to any dividend, distribution or issuance, the date fixed for the determination of the holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive such dividend, distribution or issuance, or if a dividend or distribution is paid or made or issuance is made without fixing a date, the date of such dividend, distribution or issuance and (ii) with respect to any subdivision, combination or reclassification, the effective date thereof. (c) in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this section 3, a holder of this warrant becomes entitled to acquire upon a dilutive issuance any securities of the corporation other than common stock, thereafter the number of such other securities so purchasable upon exercise of each warrant will be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the warrant shares contained in this section 3. (d) whenever the kind or number of securities receivable upon exercise of the warrants is adjusted pursuant to any of the provisions of this section 3, the corporation will promptly, and in any event within 10 calendar days after the occurrence of the event giving rise to such adjustment, give notice to the holder of such adjustment or adjustments setting forth the changes in the trigger price and in the number of holder shares a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustments and the computations upon which such adjustments are based. unless the holder objects thereto within 20 calendar days after receipt of such notice, such determination will be final. if the holder does so object, the parties will discuss in good faith the items in dispute. if such items in dispute are not so resolved, the matter will be referred for determination by deloitte & touche (or, if such firm is unable or unwilling so to act, another professional firm mutually acceptable to the holder and the corporation), which firm's determination thereof will be final. the fees and expenses of such firm will be borne by the corporation. (e) in case of any consolidation of the corporation with or merger of the corporation into another corporation or in case of any sale, transfer or lease to another corporation of all or substantially all the property of the corporation, the corporation or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, will execute an agreement providing that the holder will have the right thereafter to receive the kind and amount of shares and other securities and property that it would have been entitled to receive immediately after the occurrence of such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such action. such agreement will provide for adjustments that will be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 3. the provisions of this section 3 will similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or leases. 3 4 (f) whether or not any adjustments in the number or kind of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant has been made, this warrant (and any substitutes or replacements herefor) may continue to express the same provisions as are initially stated in this warrant. 4. covenants. (a) all shares of common stock which may be issued by the corporation pursuant of this warrant in accordance with its terms will, upon issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges of the corporation with respect to the issue thereof. (b) during the term of this warrant, the corporation will at all times have authorized and reserved for issuance to the holder a sufficient number of shares of its common stock to provide for the automatic exercise of this warrant. (c) the corporation will not, by amendment of its articles of incorporation or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, sale of assets or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith perform such terms and take all such action as may be reasonably necessary to protect the holder against impairment. 5. fractional shares. no fractional shares of common stock will be issued in connection with any issuance upon exercise of this warrant. 6. term. this warrant will expire upon the earlier of (a) such time as the holder no longer owns any shares of common stock and (b) such time when no subject securities are any longer outstanding. 7.

giving such notice, the tc and sp with respect to such dilutive issuance and the number of shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to this warrant by reason thereof. 8. no shareholder rights. the holder hereof, solely by virtue of this warrant, will not be entitled to any rights of a shareholder of the corporation. 9. transfers. this warrant may be transferred in whole, but not in part, by mei holdings, l.p. and by any subsequent holder of this warrant. the holder, by acceptance hereof, agrees that this warrant and the shares of common stock issued or issuable upon exercise of this warrant

or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors (in which designation directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two 3 or more directors not at the time parties to the proceedings; (iii) by special legal counsel: (a) selected by the board of directors or its committee in the manner described in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this section 7.2; or (b) if a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under paragraph (i) of this section 7.2 and a committee cannot be designated under paragraph (ii) of this section 7.2, then selected by majority vote of the full board of directors (in which selection directors who are parties may participate); or (iv) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not be voted on the determination. authorization of indemnification or an obligation to indemnify and an evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under paragraph (iii) of this section 7.2 to select counsel. 7.3 successful defense. to the extent that a director, officer, employee, or agent of the company has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in section 7.1 or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. 7.4 advance payment. the company shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director, officer, employee or agent who is an individual who was, is, or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent to a threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative and whether formal or informal in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding if such person furnishes the company both a written affirmation of his good-faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct set forth in section 7.1 and a written undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay any advances if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled to 4 indemnification by the company as authorized in this article. 7.5 survival of indemnification following death or termination. the right to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this article vii shall, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person. 7.6 non-exclusivity. the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this article vii shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification may be entitled under any article of incorporation, by-law, agreement, note of shareholders or directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. 7. amendments. article viii will be amended by the addition of the following sentence at the end thereof: "notwithstanding the foregoing, any alteration, amendment or repeal of any provision of article ii, iii or vii of these bylaws, and the adoption of any by-law inconsistent with any provision of said articles ii, iii and vii may be approved only by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all members of the board of directors or of the holders of shares having at least two-thirds of the voting power with respect such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption." ex-5 6 exhibit 5 1 exhibit 5 exhibit d to investment agreement ------------- standstill agreement standstill agreement, dated as of _____ __, 1996, among mountasia entertainment international, inc., a georgia corporation (the "company"), and mei holdings, l.p., a delaware limited partnership (the "purchaser"). recitals -------- a. the company and the purchaser have entered into an investment agreement (the "investment agreement"), dated june 5, 1996, pursuant to which, among other things, on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, purchaser will acquire certain shares of common stock, no par value, of the company ("common stock"). b. upon the closing of the purchase and sale of common stock pursuant to the investment agreement, the company and the purchaser will enter into a warrant agreement in the form attached as exhibit a to the investment agreement (the "warrant agreement"). c. the company and the purchaser desire to make certain provisions in respect of their relationship during the next ten years. now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree as follows: i. definitions ----------- 1.1 definitions. in addition to the terms defined elsewhere herein, as used herein, the following terms have the following meanings when used herein with initial capital letters: (a) "affiliate" of any person means any other person, that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such person;

(d) postponement of demand registration. the company will be entitled to postpone the filing period (or suspend the effectiveness) of any demand registration for a reasonable period of time not in excess of 90 calendar days, if the company determines, in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment, that such registration and offering could materially interfere with bona fide financing plans of the company or would require disclosure of information, the premature disclosure of which could materially and adversely affect the company. if the company postpones the filing of a registration statement, it will promptly notify the holders of registrable securities in writing when the events or circumstances permitting such postponement have ended. 4. piggyback registration.

and (ii) if such registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of securities of the company other than registrable securities, the company will include therein: (x) first, up to the full number of securities of such persons exercising "demand" registration rights that in the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters can be sold or allocated among such holders as they may otherwise so determine, and (y) second, the amount of registrable securities and securities proposed to be sold by any other person in excess of the amount of securities such persons exercising "demand" registration rights propose to sell that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold (allocated pro rata among the holders of such registrable securities and such other persons on the basis of the dollar amount of securities requested to be included therein). -5- 6 (c) registration of securities other than registrable securities. without the written consent of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding registrable securities, the company will not grant to any person the right to request the company to register any securities of the company under the securities act unless the rights so granted are subject to the prior rights of the holders of registrable securities set forth herein, and, if exercised, would not otherwise conflict or be inconsistent with the provisions of, this agreement. 5. restrictions on sale by holders of registrable securities. each holder of registrable securities whose registrable securities are covered by a registration statement filed pursuant to section 3 or section 4 hereof, agrees and will confirm such agreement in writing, if such holder is so requested (pursuant to a timely written notice) by the managing underwriter or underwriters in an underwritten offering, not to effect any public sale or distribution of any of the company's equity securities (except as part of such underwritten offering), including a sale pursuant to rule 144, during the 10-calendar day period prior to, and during the 90-calendar day period (or such longer period as any managing underwriter or underwriters may reasonably request in connection with any underwritten public offering) beginning on, the closing date of each underwritten offering made pursuant to such registration statement. if a request is made pursuant to this section 5, the time period during which a demand registration (if a shelf registration) is required to remain continuously effective pursuant to section 3(b) will be extended by 100 calendar days or such shorter period that will terminate when all such registrable securities not so included have been sold pursuant to such registration statement. 6. registration procedures. in connection with the company's registration obligations pursuant to sections 3 and 4 hereof, the company will effect such registrations to permit the sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the company will as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement or registration statements on any appropriate form under the securities act available for the sale of the registrable securities by the holders thereof in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and cause each such registration statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein;

(b) indemnification by holders of registrable securities. in connection with any registration statement in which a holder of registrable securities is participating, such holder of registrable securities will furnish to the company in writing such information as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any registration statement or prospectus and will severally indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the company, its directors and officers, agents and employees, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons, from and against all losses arising out of or based upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or arising out of or based upon any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such holder to the company expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus and was relied upon by the company in the preparation of such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus. in no event will the liability of any selling holder of registrable securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of payment of all expenses) received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any person shall become entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "indemnified party"), such indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the party from which such indemnity is sought (the "indemnifying party") of any claim or of the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any obligation or liability except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been prejudiced materially by such failure. all fees and expenses (including any fees and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or proceeding) will be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within five calendar days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). the indemnifying party will not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or otherwise seek to terminate any action or proceeding in which any indemnified party is or could be a party and as to which indemnification or contribution could be sought by such indemnified party under this section 8, unless such judgment, settlement or other termination -13- 14 includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release, in form and substance satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation for which such indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses or is insufficient to hold such indemnified party harmless, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, will, jointly and severally, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or indemnifying parties, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party or indemnifying parties, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or related to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses will be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any action or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provision of this section 8(d), an indemnifying party that is a selling holder of registrable securities will not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities sold by such indemnifying party and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the indemnity, contribution and expense reimbursement obligations of the company hereunder will be in addition to any liability the company may otherwise have hereunder, under the investment agreement or otherwise. the provisions of this section 8 will survive so long as registrable securities remain outstanding, notwithstanding any transfer of the registrable securities by any holder thereof or any termination of this agreement. 9. rule 144. the company will file the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act, and will cooperate with any holder of registrable -14- 15 securities (including without limitation by making such representations as any such holder may reasonably request), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitations of the exemptions provided by rule 144. upon the request of any holder of registrable securities, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such filing requirements. notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section 9 will be deemed to require the company to register any of its securities under any section of the exchange act. 10. underwritten registrations. if any of the registrable securities covered by any demand registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the holder of registrable securities that gave the demand notice with respect to such offering; provided, that such investment banker or manager shall be reasonably satisfactory to the company. if any piggyback registration is an underwritten offering, the company will have the right to select the investment banker or investment bankers and managers to administer the offering. 11. miscellaneous. (a) remedies. in the event of a breach by the company of its obligations under this agreement, each holder of registrable securities, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement. the company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it will waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
