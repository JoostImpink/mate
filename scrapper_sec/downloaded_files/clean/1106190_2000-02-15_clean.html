(a) (i) if at any time or from time to time the company: (a) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock payable in shares of its common stock or other capital stock or equity interests of the company; (b) subdivides any of its outstanding shares of common stock into a larger number of shares of common stock; (c) combines any of its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock; or (d) increases or decreases the number of shares of common stock outstanding by reclassification of its common stock, then (ii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each warrant immediately after the happening of such event will be adjusted to a number determined by: (a) multiplying the number of shares of common stock that such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive upon exercise had such warrants been exercised immediately prior to the happening of the events described in paragraphs (i)(a)-(i)(d) above (or, in the case of a dividend or distribution of common stock or other shares of the company's capital stock, immediately prior to the record date therefor); by (b) a fraction: (i) the numerator of which will be the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the happening of the events described in paragraphs (i)(a)-(i)(d) above; and (ii) the denominator of which will be the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the happening of the events described in paragraphs (i)(a)-(i)(d) above. (b) the common stock exercise price for each warrant will be adjusted to a number determined by dividing the common stock exercise price immediately prior to such event by the fraction described in section 11.1(a)(ii)(b). (c) an adjustment made pursuant to this section 11.1 will become effective immediately after the effective date of such event, retroactive to the record date for such event in the case of a dividend or distribution in shares of common stock or other shares of the company's capital stock. 11.2 adjustment for cash dividends and other distributions. (a) (i) if at any time or from time to time, the company distributes to all holders of common stock: (a) any dividend or other distribution of cash, evidences of its indebtedness, or any other assets, properties or debt securities; or (b) any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of common stock (other than, in each case, (x) any rights, options, warrants or securities described in section 11.3 and (y) any cash dividends or other cash distributions from current or retained earnings), then (ii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant will be increased to a number determined by: (a) multiplying the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrant immediately prior to the record date for any such dividend or distribution; by (b) a fraction: (i) the numerator of which will be the current market price per share of common stock on the record date for such dividend or distribution; and (ii) the denominator of which will be such current market price per share of common stock on the record date for such dividend or distribution less the sum of : (x) the amount of cash, if any, distributed per share of common stock; and (y) the fair value (as determined in good faith by the board, whose determination shall be evidenced by a board resolution, a copy of which will be sent to holders upon request) of the portion, if any, of the distribution applicable to one share of common stock, consisting of evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock, securities, other assets or property, warrants, options or subscription or purchase rights; (b) the common stock exercise price will be adjusted to a number determined by dividing the common stock exercise price immediately prior to such record date by the such fraction described in section 11.2(a)(ii)(b). such adjustments will be made whenever any distribution is made and will become effective as of the date of distribution, retroactive to the record date for any such distribution; provided that the company is not required to make an adjustment pursuant to this section 11.2 if at the time of such distribution the company makes the same distribution to holders of warrants as it makes to holders of common stock pro rata based on the number of shares of common stock for which such warrants are exercisable (whether or not currently exercisable). (c) in the event that holders of a majority of the warrants and warrant shares disagree with the company's determination of the fair value of any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock, securities, other assets or property pursuant to this section 11.2, then such fair value shall be determined by an independent financial expert selected by the holders of a majority of the warrants and warrant shares, and reasonably acceptable to the company. the holders and the company will share equally the costs of the independent financial expert. (d) no adjustment will be made pursuant to this section 11.2 which has the effect of decreasing the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each warrant or increasing the common stock exercise price. 11.3 adjustment for rights issued to all holders of common stock. (a) (i) except for transactions by the company contemplated by section 17.17(a)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) of the loan agreement, if at any time or from time to time the company issues to all holders of common stock: (a) any charge, rights, options or warrants entitling the holders of such rights, options or warrants to subscribe for additional shares of common stock at a price per share that is lower at the record date for such issuance than the then current market price per share of common stock; or (b) securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for additional shares of common stock, entitling such holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is lower at the record date for such issuance than the then current market price per share of common stock, then (ii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant shall be increased to a number determined by: (a) multiplying the number of shares of common stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of each warrant; by (b) a fraction: (i) the numerator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such rights, options, warrants or securities plus the number of additional shares of common stock subscribed for or purchased or into or for which such subscribed for or purchased securities are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable; and (ii) the denominator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such rights, options, warrants or securities plus the total number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by the company (assuming the exercise or conversion of all such rights, options, warrants or securities) would purchase at the then current market price per share of common stock. (b) in the event of any increase described in section 11.3(a), the common stock exercise price shall be adjusted to a number determined by dividing: (i) the common stock exercise price immediately prior to such date of issuance; by (ii) the fraction described in section 11.3(a)(ii)(b). such adjustment will be made immediately after such rights, options or warrants are issued and will become effective, retroactive to the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options, warrants or securities. (c) no adjustment will be made pursuant to this section 11.3 which has the effect of decreasing the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise of each warrant or of increasing the common stock exercise price. 11.4 adjustment for other issuances of common stock or rights. (a) except for transactions by the company contemplated by section 17.17(a)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) of the loan agreement and employee stock options and the excluded warrants, if at any time or from time to time the company issues: (a) shares of common stock (subject to the provisions below); (b) rights, options or warrants entitling the holder thereof to subscribe for shares of common stock (provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants); or (c) securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock (provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities (other than issuances specified in (i), (ii) or (iii) which are made as the result of anti-dilution adjustments in such securities)), at a price per share at the record date of such issuance that is less than the then current market price per share of common stock as of such date, then (ii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant will be increased to a number determined by: (a) multiplying the number of shares of common stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of each warrant; by (b) a fraction: (i) the numerator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issuance plus the number of additional shares of common stock subscribed for or purchased or into or for which such securities subscribed for or purchased that are issued are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable; and (ii) the denominator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such sale or issuance plus the total number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by the company (assuming the exercise or conversion of all such rights, options, warrants or securities, if any) would purchase at the then current market price per share of common stock. (b) the common stock exercise price will be adjusted to a number determined by dividing the common stock exercise price immediately prior to such date of issuance by the fraction described in section 11.4(a)(ii)(b). such adjustments shall be made whenever such rights, options or warrants or convertible securities are issued. (c) no adjustment will be made pursuant to this section 11.4 which has the effect of decreasing the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each warrant or of increasing the common stock exercise price. (d) for purposes of this section 11.4 only, any issuance of common stock, or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for, or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, common stock, which issuance (or agreement to issue) is: (i) in exchange for or otherwise in connection with the acquisition of the property (excluding any such exchange exclusively for cash) of any person; and (ii) at a price per share equal to the current market price at the time of signing a definitive agreement shall be deemed to have been made at a price per share equal to the current market price per share at the record date with respect to such issuance (the time of closing or consummation of such exchange or acquisition) if such definitive agreement is entered into within 90 days of the date of such agreement in principle. 11.5 no adjustment. no adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each warrant shall be required under this agreement unless such adjustment would result in an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the common stock exercise price; provided, that any adjustments which by reason of this section 11.5 are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations shall be made to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent or to the nearest one-thousandth of a share, as the case may be. 11.6 notice of adjustment. whenever the common stock exercise price or the number of shares of common stock and other property, if any, issuable upon exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as provided in this agreement, the company shall deliver to the holder a certificate setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated, including a description of the basis on which: (a) it determined the fair value of any evidences of indebtedness, other securities or property or warrants, options or other subscription or purchase rights; and (b) the current market price of the common stock was determined, if either of such determinations were required), and specifying the common stock exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants after giving effect to such adjustment. 11.7 merger or consolidation. in case of any consolidation of the company with, or merger of the company into, another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger which does not result in any reclassification or change of the outstanding common stock), the corporation formed by such consolidation or merger shall execute and deliver to the holder a supplemental warrant agreement providing that the holder of each warrant then outstanding or to be outstanding shall have the right thereafter (until the expiration of such warrant) to receive, upon exercise of such warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which such warrant might have been exercised immediately prior to such consolidation or merger. such supplemental warrant agreement shall provide for adjustments which shall be identical to the adjustments provided in this section 11. this subsection shall similarly apply to successive consolidations or mergers. 12. exchange and replacement of warrant certificates. each warrant certificate is exchangeable, without expense, upon its surrender by the holder at the principal executive office of the company for a new warrant certificate of like tenor and date representing in the aggregate the right to purchase the same number of warrant shares in such denominations as shall be designated by the holder at the time of such surrender. upon receipt by the company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any warrant certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it and reimbursement to the company of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender and cancellation of the warrant, if mutilated, the company will make and deliver a new warrant certificate of like tenor, in lieu of such warrant certificate. 13. limitation of fractional interests. the company shall not be required to issue fractional warrant shares upon exercise of the warrants or distribute warrant certificates that evidence fractional warrant shares. in addition, in no event shall the holder be required to make any payment of a fraction of a cent. in lieu of fractional warrant shares, there shall be paid to the holders of warrant certificates at the time the warrants are exercised an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market price per warrant share on the business day preceding the date the warrant certificates evidencing such warrants are surrendered for exercise. such payments shall be made by check or by wire transfer to an account designated by such holder. if any holder surrenders for exercise more than one warrant certificate, the number of warrant shares deliverable to such holder may, at the option of the company, be computed on the basis of the aggregate amount of all the warrants exercised by such holder. 14. reservation and listing of securities. the company will at all times reserve and keep available shares of common stock, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue warrant shares upon exercise of warrants. every transfer agent ("transfer agent") for the common stock and other securities of the company issuable upon the exercise of the warrants will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares of common stock as shall be necessary for such purpose. the company will supply every such transfer agent with duly executed stock and other certificates, as appropriate, for such purpose. upon exercise of the warrants and payment of the common stock exercise price, all shares of common stock upon such exercise will be duly and validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and not subject to the preemptive rights of any stockholder. upon exercise of the warrants, the company will use its best efforts to cause all shares of common stock issued in connection with such exercise to be listed (subject to official notice of issuance) on all securities exchanges on which the common stock issued to the public in connection herewith may then be listed and quoted on nasdaq or the otc electronic bulletin board. 15. notices to warrant holders. nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed as conferring upon the holders the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as a stockholder in respect of any meetings of stockholders for the election of directors or any other matter, or as having any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the company. if, however, at any time prior to the expiration date: (a) the company takes a record of the holders of its shares of common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution payable otherwise than out of current or retained earnings, as indicated by the accounting treatment of such dividend or distribution on the books of the company; or (b) a dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company, a consolidation or merger, or sale of all or substantially all of its property, assets and business as an entirety shall be proposed, the company will give written notice of such event at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date fixed as a record date or the date of closing the transfer books for the determination of the stockholders entitled to such dividend, distribution, convertible or exchangeable securities or subscription rights, or entitled to vote on such proposed dissolution, liquidation, winding up or sale. such notice shall specify such record date or the date of closing the transfer books, as the case may be. failure to give such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of any action taken in connection with the declaration or payment of any such dividend, or any proposed dissolution, liquidation, winding up, consolidation, merger or sale. 16. notices. all notices, requests, consents and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly made and sent when delivered, or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested: (a) if to a holder, to the address of such holder as shown on the books of the company or to such other address as such holder may designate by notice to the company; or (b) if to the company, to the address set forth on the signature pages to this agreement or to such other address as the company may designate by notice to the holders. 17. supplements; amendments; entire agreement. (a) any provisions of this agreement or the warrants may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by the company and the holders of a majority of the warrants and warrant shares. (b) this agreement (including the loan agreement to the extent portions of it are referred to in this agreement) constitutes the entire obligations of the parties to this agreement and supersedes, any previous expressions of intent or understanding in respect of this transaction. 18. successors. all of the covenants and provisions of this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the company, the holders and their respective successors and assigns hereunder. 19. governing law. this agreement and each warrant certificate issued under this agreement is governed by new york law.

captions. the caption headings of the sections of this agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not intended, nor should they be construed as, a part of this agreement and shall be given no substantive effect. 22. benefits of this agreement. nothing in this agreement shall be construed to give to any person or corporation other than the company and the holders any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this agreement. this agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the company and any holders. 23. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in
