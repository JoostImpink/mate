page 14 of 27 pages o all shares of common stock that are owned directly or indirectly by the company as treasury stock shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of aon or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and o each issued and outstanding share of common stock (other than shares to be canceled) shall be converted into the right to receive a fraction of a fully paid and non-assessable share of aon's common stock, $1.00 par value per share ("aon stock"), such fraction to be in the ratio (the "exchange ratio") as set forth in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below. if the average stock price (as hereinafter defined) is: (i) greater than $42.00, the exchange ratio shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) $17.85 by (b) the average stock price;

(b) cancellation of treasury stock. all shares of company common stock that are owned directly or indirectly by the company as treasury stock shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. (c) exchange ratio for company common stock. subject to section 2.2, each issued and outstanding share of company common stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with section 2.1(b) and any dissenting shares (as defined in section 2.3 hereof)) shall be converted into the right to receive a fraction of a fully paid and non-assessable share of parent's common stock, $1.00 par value per share ("parent common stock"), such fraction to be in the ratio (the "exchange ratio") as set forth in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately following sentence. if the average stock price (as hereinafter defined) is: (i) greater than $42.00, the exchange ratio shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) $17.85 by (b) the average stock price; (ii) equal to or greater than $34.00 but less than or equal to $42.00, the exchange ratio shall be .425; (iii) equal to or greater than $31.00 but less than $34.00, the exchange ratio shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) $14.45 by (b) the average stock price; or (iv) less than $31.00, the exchange ratio shall be .466129 (provided that, in accordance with section 7.1(c) hereof, the company may have the right to terminate this agreement if the average stock price is less than $31.00). 3 "average stock price" means the average of the daily closing prices during the regular session of parent common stock on the new york stock exchange for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately prior to the closing date. all such shares of company common stock when so converted shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of parent common stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with section 2.2, without interest. (d) adjustments to exchange ratio. the exchange ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for parent common stock or company common stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to parent common stock or company common stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the effective time. section 2.2 exchange of certificates. the procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of company common stock for parent common stock pursuant to the merger are as follows: (a) exchange agent. as of the effective time, parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company designated by parent (the "exchange agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of company common stock for exchange in accordance with this section 2.2, through the exchange agent, (i) certificates representing the shares of parent common stock (such shares of parent common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "exchange fund") issuable pursuant to section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of company common stock and (ii) cash, as required, in an amount sufficient to make payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, required pursuant to section 2.2(e). (b) exchange procedures. promptly after the effective time, parent shall instruct the exchange agent and the exchange agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the effective time represented outstanding shares of company common stock (the "certificates") whose shares of company common stock were converted pursuant to section 2.1 into the right to receive shares of parent common stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as parent and the company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of parent common stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of parent common stock as provided below). upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by parent, together with such letter of 4 transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of parent common stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this article 2 after taking into account all the shares of company common stock then held by such holder under all such certificates so surrendered, and the certificate so transferred shall immediately be canceled. in the event of a transfer of ownership of company common stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of parent common stock may be issued to a transferee if the certificate representing such company common stock is presented to the exchange agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. until surrendered as contemplated by this section 2.2, each certificate shall be deemed at any time after the effective time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of parent common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of parent common stock as contemplated by this section 2.2. (c) distributions with respect to unexchanged shares. no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the effective time with respect to parent common stock with a record date after the effective time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate with respect to the shares of parent common stock to which such holder is entitled until the holder of record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate. subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such certificate there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of parent common stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of parent common stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to subsection (e) below and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of parent common stock after the effective time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of parent common stock.
