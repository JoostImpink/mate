issued upon conversion of any loans, or any accrued and unpaid interest on any loans, made by sony music or time warner pursuant to the convertible loan agreement. the termination agreement further provides that sony and time warner, and any of their respective subsidiaries who hold shares of cdnow common stock, acting as one group, shall be entitled, but shall not be required, at any time and from time to time, to designate one individual (the "designee") to serve as a member of the board of directors of cdnow. the right of sony and time warner, and any of their respective subsidiaries who hold shares of cdnow common stock, to designate the designee shall terminate whenever the total number of shares of cdnow common stock held by sony, time warner or any of their respective subsidiaries shall be less than 50% of the number of shares constituting the purchased shares (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). the description of the terms of each of the termination agreement,

borrower, in an amount not to exceed the loan commitment under the convertible loan agreement. the loan commitment under the convertible loan agreement is $30,000,000; provided that in no event will the loan commitment of either sony music or time warner exceed $15,000,000. each of sony music and time warner, at its sole option, at any time and from time to time, has the right to convert all outstanding loans made by it under the convertible loan agreement, and any accrued and unpaid interest on the loans, into shares of cdnow common stock at a conversion price of $10.00 per share (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). in addition, pursuant to the termination agreement, on march 16, 2000, sca caused sony music to purchase from cdnow, for a purchase price of $10,500,000, 1,202,750 shares of cdnow common stock and time warner purchased from cdnow, on behalf of twi cdnow holdings, for a purchase price of $10,500,000, 1,202,750 shares of cdnow common stock. as a result of these transactions: (i) assuming that sony music makes loans to cdnow in the full amount of its loan commitment, based on the conversion price currently in effect, sony music would have the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 1,500,000 shares of common stock of cdnow, representing approximately 4.7% of the outstanding shares of cdnow common stock; and (ii) sony music beneficially owns 1,202,750 shares of cdnow common stock, representing approximately 3.8% of the outstanding shares of cdnow common stock (assuming the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of cdnow common stock pursuant to the convertible loan agreement). sony music has the power to vote, and the power to dispose of, 2,702,750 shares of cdnow common stock. sony and sca are deemed beneficial owners of

and unpaid interest on the loan represented by such note (including without limitation any overdue interest accruing at the default rate), into a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/100 of a share) of cdnow common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the aggregate of such principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest to be so converted by (ii) the conversion price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. any certificates evidencing cdnow common stock issued upon the conversion of the note shall bear such legends, including legends reflecting restrictions on transfer required in order to maintain compliance with the provisions of the securities act, as the borrower shall deem to be necessary or appropriate. section 8.2 exercise of conversion privileges. in order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any amount of principal or interest

borrower or in blank, at the principal executive offices of the borrower, and, in all cases, deliver a notice of conversion election (in the form attached hereto as exhibit c, a "notice of conversion election") to the effect that such lender elects to convert such note or, if less than the entire principal amount and interest thereof is to be converted, the portion thereof to be converted. any amount of principal and interest of a note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the day of delivery of the relevant notice of conversion election in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of such lender as a holder of the note with respect to the principal amount to be so converted (or, in the case of conversion of

borrower issuable upon conversion, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in section 8.3. section 8.3 fractions of shares. no fractional share of cdnow common stock shall be issued upon conversion of a note. instead of any fractional share of such cdnow common stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of such note (or a portion thereof), or upon the conversion of any interest (including defaulted interest) payable with respect to such note, the borrower shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the closing price of the cdnow common stock at the close of business on the day of conversion (or, if such day is not a trading day, on the trading date immediately preceding such day). section 8.4 adjustment of conversion price. the conversion price then applicable to any note shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions attached hereto as exhibit d. section 8.5 notice of adjustments of conversion price. whenever the conversion price of any note is adjusted, the borrower shall compute the adjusted conversion price in accordance with

adjustment is based, and such certificate shall be provided to the lenders. section 8.6 company to reserve cdnow common stock. the borrower shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from

unpaid interest thereon, the full number of shares of its cdnow common stock then issuable upon the conversion of the entire 32 principal amount of the aggregate loan commitment and all interest that would accrue on such aggregate amount up to and including the final maturity date. section 8.7 taxes on conversions. the borrower will pay any and all original issuance, transfer, stamp and other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of its common shock on conversion of notes and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon pursuant hereto. the borrower shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of its cdnow common stock in a name other than that of a lender or other holder of the note, portion thereof or interest thereon to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the borrower the amount of any such tax, or has established to the satisfaction of the borrower that such tax has been paid. section 8.8 covenant as to cdnow common stock. (a) the borrower covenants that all shares of its cdnow common stock which may be issued upon conversion of notes or any interest payment in respect thereof will upon issue be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(b) upon the conversion of any notes or any interest payment in respect thereof, the lender will be acquiring cdnow common stock issued upon such conversion for investment for its own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" thereof within the meaning of the securities act. the lender has no present intention of selling, granting and participation in, or otherwise distributing the cdnow common stock, except in compliance with the securities act or pursuant to an available exemption thereunder. (c) the lender understands that the cdnow common stock has not been registered under the securities act or registered or qualified under any state securities law in reliance on specific exemptions therefrom, which exemptions may depend upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the lender's investment intent as expressed herein. the lender is familiar with rule 144 under the securities act, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the securities act. the lender further understands that the certificate(s) representing the cdnow common stock shall bear the following legend: the shares represented by this certificate have been acquired for investment and have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 or under any applicable state securities laws. the shares may not be sold or transferred in the absence of such registration or an exemption therefrom. 34 section 9. registration rights. the lenders and the borrower agree that, with respect to any and all shares of common stock of the borrower issued upon conversion of any note or any portion thereof, or any interest payable with respect thereto, the lenders shall have the registration rights provided for in the stock option agreement regardless of whether or not such agreement shall be in effect, and any and all shares of common stock of the borrower issued upon conversion of the loans or any portion thereof, or any interest payable with respect thereto, shall constitute shares of securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to the lenders upon exercise of the "option" as defined therein. section 10. miscellaneous. section 10.1 payment of expenses, indemnity, etc. the borrower shall: (a) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each lender in connection with the preservation of rights under, and enforcement of, the loan documents and the documents and instruments referred to therein or in connection with any restructuring or rescheduling of the obligations (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for each lender); (b) pay, and hold the lenders harmless from and against, any and all present and future stamp, excise and other similar taxes with respect to the foregoing matters and hold the lenders harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or omission (other than to the extent attributable to the lender) to pay such taxes; and (c) indemnify each lender, its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents (each an "indemnitee") from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel for such indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not such indemnitee shall be 35 designated a party thereto) that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the obligations) be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by any indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way related to or by reason of, any of the transactions or the execution, delivery or performance of any loan document except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnitee. section 10.2 right of setoff. in addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default each lender is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to any loan party or any other person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off any other indebtedness or other obligation at any time held or owing by such lender to or for the credit or the account of any loan party against and on account of the obligations of the loan parties to such lender under this agreement or under any of the other loan documents, and all other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this agreement or any other loan document, irrespective of whether or not the lenders shall have made any demand hereunder and although said obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured. section 10.3 notices. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon personal delivery to the party to be notified;

grantor, and each grantor agrees that each issuer shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect to the pledged securities directly to the security agent. 6.4 proceeds to be turned over to security agent. in addition to the rights of the security agent and the lenders specified in section 6.1 with respect to payments of receivables, if an event of default shall occur and be continuing, all proceeds received by any grantor consisting of cash, checks and other near-cash items shall be held by such grantor in trust for the security agent and the lenders, segregated from other funds of such grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such grantor, be turned over to the security agent in the exact form received by such grantor (duly indorsed by such grantor to the security agent, if required). all proceeds received by the security agent hereunder shall be held by the security agent in a collateral account maintained under its sole dominion and control. all proceeds while held by the security agent in a collateral account (or by such grantor in trust for the security agent and the

party, to pay all fees, costs, expenses of the security agent and the lenders incurred in connection with the performance of their duties hereunder or under the loan documents, as the case may be, including attorneys' fees and expenses and any other amounts payable to the security agent and the lenders hereunder or under any of the loan documents in respect of any indemnities; second, to the lenders pro rata in accordance with the aggregate amount of interest owed to such lenders; third, to the lenders pro rata in accordance with the aggregate amount of all other obligations held by such

shall occur and be continuing, the security agent, on behalf of the lenders, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the new york ucc or any other applicable law. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the security agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any grantor or any other person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of the 23 security agent or any lender or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. the security agent or any lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. each grantor further agrees, at the security agent's request, to assemble the collateral and make it available to the security agent at places which the security agent shall reasonably select, whether at such grantor's premises or elsewhere. the security agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this section 6.6, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the collateral or in any way relating to the collateral or the rights of the security agent and the lenders hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the obligations, in the order set forth in section 6.5, and only after such application and after the payment by the security agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, section 9-504(1)(c) of the new york ucc, need the security agent account for the surplus, if any, to any grantor. to the extent permitted by applicable law, each grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the security agent or any lender arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. if any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition. 6.7 registration rights. each grantor recognizes that the security agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the pledged stock, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the securities act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices 24 and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. the security agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the pledged stock for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the securities act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so. 6.8 waiver; deficiency. to the extent permitted by applicable law, each grantor waives and agrees not to assert any rights or privileges which it may acquire under section 9-112 of the new york ucc. each grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the collateral are insufficient to pay its obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the security agent or any lender to collect such deficiency. section 7. the security agent ------------------ 7.1 appointment. each lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the security agent as the agent of such lender under this agreement and the other loan documents, and each such lender irrevocably authorizes the security agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this agreement and the other loan documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the security agent by the terms of this agreement and the other loan documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this agreement, the security agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this agreement or any other loan document or otherwise exist against the security agent. the security agent shall not take any action to foreclose upon, sell or otherwise realize upon any collateral unless directed to do so by the lenders acting jointly. 25 7.2 delegation of duties. the security agent may execute any of its duties under this agreement and the other loan documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. the security agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. 7.3 exculpatory provisions. neither the security agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under or in connection with this agreement or any other loan document (except for its breach of this agreement or its or such person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any grantor or any officer thereof contained in this agreement or any other loan document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the security agent under or in connection with, this agreement or any other loan document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this agreement or any other loan document or for any failure of any grantor to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. the security agent shall not be under any obligation to any lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this agreement or any other loan document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any grantor. 7.4 reliance by security agent. the security agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to any grantor), independent accountants and other experts selected by the security agent. the security agent may deem and treat the payee of any note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the security 26 agent. the security agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this agreement or any other loan document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. the security agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this agreement and the other loan documents in accordance with a request of the lenders, acting jointly, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the lenders and all future holders of the loans. 7.5 notice of default. the security agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any default or event of default hereunder unless the security agent has received notice from a lender or the borrower referring to the credit agreement, describing such default or event of default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". in the event that the security agent receives such a notice, the security agent shall give notice thereof to the lenders. the security agent shall take such action with respect to such default or event of default as shall be reasonably directed by the lenders, acting jointly. 7.6 non-reliance on security agent and other lenders. each lender expressly acknowledges that neither the security agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the security agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the security agent to any lender. each lender represents to the security agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the security agent or any other lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the grantors and made its own decision to make its loans under the credit agreement and enter into this agreement. each lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the security agent or any other lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and 27 decisions in taking or not taking action under this agreement and the other loan documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the borrower. except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the lenders by the security agent hereunder, the security agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any grantor which may come into the possession of the security agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates. 7.7 indemnification. the lenders agree to indemnify the security agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the grantor and without limiting the obligation of the grantor to do so), ratably, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the security agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the loan commitment, this agreement, any of the other loan documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the security agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the security agent's breach of this agreement, gross negligence or willful misconduct. the agreements in this subsection shall survive the payment of the loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 7.8 security agent in its individual capacity. the security agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the grantor as though the security agent were not the security agent hereunder and under the other loan documents. with respect to the loans made by it, the security agent shall have the same rights and powers under this agreement and the other loan documents as any lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the security 28 agent, and the terms "lender" and "lenders" shall include the security agent in its individual capacity. 7.9 security agent's appointment as attorney-in- fact, etc. (1) each grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the security agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such grantor and in the name of such grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each grantor hereby gives the security agent the power and right, on behalf of such grantor, without notice to or assent by such grantor, to do any or all of the following: (1) in the name of such grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any receivable or contract or with respect to any other collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the security agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any receivable or contract or with respect to any other collateral whenever payable; (2) in the case of any intellectual property, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments,

moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the security agent or as the security agent shall direct; (6) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys,

warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other documents in connection with any of the collateral; (8) commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any collateral; (9) defend any

trademark pertains), throughout the world for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the security agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (12) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the collateral as fully and completely as though the security agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the security agent's option and such 30 grantor's expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the security agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the collateral and the security agent's and the lenders' security interests therein and to effect the intent of this agreement, all as fully and effectively as such grantor might do. anything in this section 7.9(1) to the contrary notwithstanding, the security agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this section 7.9(1) unless an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing.

(2) distributions of debt, assets, subscription rights or convertible securities. in case the borrower shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of cdnow common stock of evidences of its indebtedness, assets, cash dividends or distributions (excluding dividends or distributions referred to in sections (a)(1) above and excluding distributions in connection with the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the borrower) or securities (excluding those referred to in section (a)(1) above), then, in each case, the number of shares of cdnow common stock issuable after such record date for such dividend or distribution upon the conversion of each note shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of cdnow common stock issuable upon the conversion of such note immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the closing price per share of cdnow common stock immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or 2 distribution and the denominator of which shall be the closing price per share of cdnow common stock immediately prior to the record date for such distribution less the then fair value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the borrower) of the portion of the assets, evidences of indebtedness, cash dividends or distributions or securities so distributed applicable to one share of cdnow common stock. an adjustment made pursuant to this section (a)(2) shall be made whenever any such distribution is made, and shall become effective on the date of distribution retroactive to the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution.
