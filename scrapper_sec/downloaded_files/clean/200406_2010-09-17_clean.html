under the long-term innovation collaboration, ortho-mcneil-janssen pharmaceuticals or its affiliates and crucell will jointly work to discover and develop a universal flu vaccine for the prevention of influenza, as well as antibody and/or vaccine products against up to three additional infectious or non-infectious disease targets to be selected after exploratory research. &#160; both collaborations will leverage the vaccine/antibody know-how and technology platforms of crucell and the broad scientific and development expertise of ortho-mcneil-janssen pharmaceuticals and its affiliates. &#160; ortho-mcneil-janssen pharmaceuticals will hold commercialization rights for products resulting from both collaborations in all countries throughout the world with the exception of the european union and certain additional european countries, where crucell will retain commercialization rights. ortho-mcneil-janssen pharmaceuticals&#8217; commercialization rights for products emerging from the innovation collaboration may be expanded worldwide if crucell elects not to contribute toward development. &#160; influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. &#160; in 2008 alone, some 14 million people in the industrialized world were diagnosed with influenza, with millions more being diagnosed in developing regions. annual flu epidemics are thought to result in 3&#8211;5 million cases of severe illness and result in more than 350 thousand deaths every year around the world. &#160; &#8220;despite significant advances in prevention and treatment, influenza remains a major health threat, and each year, vaccines must be formulated to address the current influenza strain,&#8221; said paul stoffels, global head, pharmaceuticals research and development, johnson &amp; johnson. &#8220;a universal antibody or vaccine that protects against a broad range of strains would be an important advance in helping doctors and nurses manage the annual influenza season and control acute epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. we are excited about this collaboration with crucell because it provides us access to antibody and vaccine know-how and technology and expands our ability to offer preventive health care solutions for unmet medical needs.&#8221; &#160; &#160; &#160; 30 &#160; &#160; &#160; crucell&#8217;s chief executive officer, ronald brus, said: &#8220;crucell&#8217;s innovative technologies for the discovery, development and manufacture of antibody products and vaccines provide avenues to develop much-needed medical solutions for global health threats. we are delighted that this collaboration with johnson &amp; johnson will strengthen and facilitate our efforts to bring innovation to global health. it provides an avenue to accelerate crucell&#8217;s existing &#8216;flu-mab&#8217; program, which has already demonstrated the potential to deliver an antibody product for the prevention and treatment of any type of influenza strain.&#8221; &#160; in connection with the equity investment, crucell and jhc nederland have entered into a shareholder agreement setting forth certain rights and restrictions of jhc nederland as a shareholder, which includes a 3-year standstill requiring crucell&#8217;s consent for an increase of jhc nederland's interest in crucell (subject to customary exceptions), a 3-month lock-up on transfers of the shares (subject to customary exceptions) and certain other provisions. the shareholder agreement will be described in more detail in the prospectus which will be issued by crucell in connection with the listing of the shares issued to jhc nederland. &#160; on august 18, 2009, crucell announced that it had received a u.s. national institutes of health (nih) contract aimed at advancing the development of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza. the contract provides funding of up to $40.7 million, with additional options worth a further $28.4 million that may be triggered at the discretion of the nih, bringing the potential total award amount to $69.1 million. this funding will be used for crucell&#8217;s work in the flu-mab collaboration announced today between crucell and ortho-mcneil-janssen pharmaceuticals to expedite the potential availability of a universal antibody product for the treatment and prevention of influenza in humans. &#160; the transaction is expected to have an estimated dilutive impact of $0.02 to $0.04 on johnson &amp; johnson&#8217;s 2009 adjusted earnings per share. &#160; crucell conference call and webcast for media &#160;

(nyse euronext, nasdaq: crxl; swiss exchange: crx) today announced that they are in advanced negotiations for a potential public offer by johnson &amp; johnson or an affiliate for all outstanding ordinary shares of crucell not already held by johnson &amp; johnson and its affiliates. johnson &amp; johnson, through an affiliate, currently holds approximately 17.9 percent of the outstanding shares of crucell and has submitted a statement on schedule 13d to the u.s. securities and exchange commission in connection with its change in investment intent with respect to crucell. &#160; under the terms of the negotiations, which are at an advanced stage, johnson &amp; johnson or an affiliate would acquire all outstanding equity of crucell that it does not already own for approximately &#8364;1.75 billion, which represents a purchase price of &#8364;24.75 per share. the public offer would be an all cash transaction. &#160; this potential transaction would enable crucell to benefit from johnson &amp; johnson&#8217;s expertise and experience in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. the companies expect that crucell&#8217;s strength in the manufacture, discovery and commercialization of vaccines would create a strong platform for johnson &amp; johnson in the vaccine market. after closing of the potential transaction johnson &amp; johnson expects to maintain crucell&#8217;s existing facilities, to retain crucell&#8217;s senior management and, generally, to maintain current employment levels. johnson &amp; johnson also intends to keep crucell as the center for vaccines within the johnson &amp; johnson pharmaceutical group, and to maintain crucell&#8217;s headquarters in leiden. &#160; both companies expect that crucell, as johnson &amp; johnson&#8217;s vaccine center, would retain its entrepreneurial culture that has fostered innovation and growth. johnson &amp; johnson intends to continue to invest in the continued development of crucell&#8217;s products and pipeline and support crucell&#8217;s mission to increase the number of people around the globe protected from infectious diseases. &#160; in accordance with customary dutch practice, and to adequately protect the interest of any minority shareholders, johnson &amp; johnson expects to retain two independent supervisory directors after closing for such time as is necessary for johnson &amp; johnson to acquire all of the outstanding equity of crucell. &#160; while the parties are still in negotiations with respect to the terms of a definitive agreement for the potential transaction, any proposed transaction would be subject to customary pre-offer conditions, including consultation with the relevant works council and trade unions, and customary offer conditions. &#160; the board of directors of johnson &amp; johnson and the supervisory board of crucell have authorized the companies to proceed with these negotiations for a potential transaction. although johnson &amp; johnson&#8217;s due diligence is substantially complete, the transaction remains subject to negotiation of terms of a definitive agreement and receipt of internal approvals of johnson &amp; johnson management and the management and supervisory boards of crucell. there can be no assurances that a definitive agreement will be entered into and that discussions will result in a transaction.&#160;&#160;in addition, the terms of any potential transaction may be different from what is described in this press release. &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; about crucell crucell n.v.
