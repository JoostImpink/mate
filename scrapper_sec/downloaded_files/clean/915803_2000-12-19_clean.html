a copy of which is attached as exhibit 9 hereto, the issuer has granted certain management, investment monitoring and other rights to the partnership. among other rights, the partnership may require the issuer, if the partnership determines, based on the advice of counsel, that it is required to maintain a representative of the purchaser on the board of directors of the issuer in order to qualify

that any shares 8 not tendered by shareholders in the tender offer (other than shares held by the principal shareholders) would be converted into only the right to receive the tender offer price in cash (the "post tender-offer merger"). the number of shares issuable under each of the warrants is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including a reduction in the number of shares issuable pursuant to each warrant in connection with the consummation of a post tender-offer merger, all as more fully described in each of the warrants. other than as described above, none of

person in writing within ten (10) days of its receipt of such written notice to the company that it will assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably acceptable to such person; or

indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company parties, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, either any company party or such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8.5 reimbursement of deal-related costs and expenses. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise, whether or not the

warrants and the other investment document constitute the full and entire agreement and understanding between the purchaser, on the one hand, and the company parties, on the other hand, relating to

other investment documents, including, without limitation, all or any part of the obligations, subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws; provided, however, that the company parties may continue to deal solely and directly with the purchaser in connection with any right, title or interest so assigned until written notice of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses and related information with respect to the assignee, shall have been given to the company. if the purchaser assigns to any assignee a fifty percent (50.0%) or lesser interest in and to the aggregate principal amount of the note then outstanding, any decisions that the purchaser is entitled to make under this agreement, the note and the other investment documents shall be made by the purchaser, and the company may continue to deal solely and directly with respect to the purchaser in connection with the interests so assigned to the assignee. if the purchaser assigns to any assignee more than a fifty percent (50.0%) interest in and to the aggregate principal amount of the note then outstanding, any decisions that the purchaser is entitled to make under this agreement, the note and the other investment documents shall be made (a) by the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the note outstanding at the time such decision is or is to be made, or (b) if notice thereof is given to the company by the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the note outstanding at the time, such decisions shall be made in the manner directed by such holders. notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such assignment by the purchaser, the following provisions shall not be assignable by the purchaser to any assignee, except to an

provisions of this note shall be construed in accordance with their fair meaning, and not strictly for or against the issuers or the holder. 19. waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the issuers and the holder wish applicable state and federal 9 laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the issuers and the holder desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, and understanding they are waiving a constitutional right, the issuers and the holder (by acceptance hereof) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit, or proceeding brought to resolve any dispute, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising out of, connected with, related to, or incidental to, this note or the transactions completed hereby. 10 in witness whereof, the issuers have caused this note to be executed and delivered by its or their duly authorized representatives on the date first above written. the quizno's

distribution of assets or securities. (a) if at any time the company issues (without payment of any consideration) to all holders of outstanding common stock any option rights, then the company shall also distribute such option rights to the holder as if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such issuance. any reduction by the company in the exercise price of any existing option rights shall be treated as a new issuance of option rights and the provisions of this section 4.2(a) shall apply. (b) if at any time the company makes a distribution (a "distribution") to its stockholders (other than in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company) of any asset (including cash) or security (the total of the assets or securities so distributed, the "distribution amount") other than those referred to in section 4.1 or section 4.3 or section 4.4, then, at the holder's option (provided that if the distribution is in cash, the adjustment described in section 4.2(b)(ii) below shall not apply): (i) the holder shall have the right to receive the portion of the distribution amount which a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the distribution would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such distribution. upon the closing of the distribution, the company shall distribute such portion of the distribution amount to the holder; or (ii) the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted and shall be equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, multiplied by a fraction (which shall not be less than zero), the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock on the date fixed for such determination, less the then-fair market value of the portion of the assets, or the fair market value of the portion of the securities, as the case may be, so distributed applicable to one share of common stock, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock. such 9 adjustment to the warrant purchase price shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day immediately following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. upon any adjustment to the warrant purchase price as provided for in this section 4.2(b)(ii), the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall also be adjusted and shall be equal to the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. 4.3 issuance of equity securities under certain circumstances. (a) if, at any time after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell (or, in accordance with section 4.3(b), shall be deemed to have issued or sold) any shares of common stock (other than excluded securities) without consideration or for a consideration per share that is less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined as of the date of such issuance or sale, then, effective immediately upon such issuance or sale, the warrant purchase price shall be reduced (calculated to the nearest $.001 and without regard to any other provisions of this section 4) to an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately prior to such issuance or sale by (2) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale, plus (b) the cash consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale, and the denominator of which shall be the product obtained by multiplying (c) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately after such sale or issuance, by (d) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale. upon each such adjustment of the warrant purchase price hereunder, the number of warrant shares which may be obtained upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number of shares determined by multiplying (x) the number of warrant shares which could be obtained upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately after such adjustment. adjustments shall be made successively whenever such an issuance or sale is made. (b) for the purpose of determining the adjusted warrant purchase price under section 4.3(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of option rights. if the company in any manner issues or grants any option rights or convertible securities and the price per share for 10 which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such option rights or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of such issuance or grant of such option rights, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such option rights (or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such option rights) shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon exercise of option rights or upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities issuable upon exercise of option rights shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuing or granting of such option rights, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such option rights, plus in the case of such option rights which relate to convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such option rights or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any manner issues or grants any convertible securities having an exercise or conversion or exchange price per share of common stock which is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of issuance or sale, then the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities is determined by dividing (a) the total amount received by the company as consideration for the issuance or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. (iii) change in equity price or conversion rate. if the purchase price provided for in any option rights, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock decreases at any time, then the warrant purchase price in effect at the time of such decrease shall be readjusted to the warrant purchase price which would have been in 11 effect at such time had such option rights or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such decreased purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold and the number of warrant shares shall be correspondingly readjusted, by taking the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. (iv) calculation of consideration received. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, then the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold for consideration other than cash, then the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). (v) intentionally omitted. (vi) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, option rights or convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, option rights or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such distribution or the date of the granting or such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (c) no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 4.3 with respect to the issuance of excluded shares. 4.4 reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. (a) if at any time prior to the expiration date, the company reorganizes its capital, reclassifies its capital stock, consolidates, merges or combines with or into another person (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is any change whatsoever in, or distribution with respect to, the outstanding common stock), or the company sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its property, assets or business to another person, other than in a transaction provided for in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 12 or 4.6, or other than the tender offer merger, and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale, transfer or other disposition of assets, (i) shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or of the company (if it is the surviving corporation) or (ii) any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or the company ("other property") are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock who are holders immediately prior to such transaction, then the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of common stock, common stock of the successor or acquiring person, and/or other property which holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such event. in such event, the aggregate warrant purchase price otherwise payable for the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be allocated among such securities and other property in proportion to the respective fair market values of such securities and other property as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). if, in connection with the tender offer merger, the company creates a new entity ("newco") and richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden exchange the capital stock held by them for equity securities of newco, the company shall not participate in the formation of newco without the express written consent of llcp in its sole discretion unless (i) this warrant is exchanged for a like warrant of newco and the capital structure of newco is identical to the capital structure of the company with respect to capital stock held by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden and llcp has the right to exchange this warrant and any shares of common stock or preferred stock it holds on the same basis as richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden, (ii) the exchange of this warrant for a like warrant of newco is tax-free to the holder, as determined by llcp in its discretion, (iii) a new warrant for common stock of newco is issued to the holder that is identical to this warrant and such warrant shall preserve the rights and privileges of this warrant and (iv) after such exchange, the number of equity securities owned by the holder in relationship to the number of equity securities owned by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden is not diminished in any way. (b) in case of any such event, the successor or acquiring person (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as the holder may approve in writing (and memorialized by resolutions of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of any shares of common stock of such successor or acquiring person for which this warrant thus becomes exercisable, which modifications shall be as equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4.4. for purposes of this section 4, "common stock of the successor or acquiring person" shall include stock or other equity securities, or securities that are exercisable or exchangeable 13 for or convertible into equity securities, of such corporation, or other securities if such person is not a corporation, of any class that is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation or person and that is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.4 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets. (c) if the number of shares of common stock held by shareholders of the company other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden is reduced within nine (9) months of the date hereof due to (i) the consummation of the tender offer or the tender offer merger; (ii) purchases by the company of its common stock pursuant to rule 10b-18 of the exchange act other than from richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; (iii) private purchases by the company of its common stock from shareholders other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; or (iv) whether before or after nine (9) months from the date hereof, purchases of common stock by the company from richard f. schaden in compliance with the terms of the subordinated indebtedness set forth in sections 10.1 and 10.4 of the securities purchase agreement, and such reduced shares are retired or otherwise no longer outstanding after such merger or repurchase, the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant and the other warrants exercisable for common stock shall be reduced so that the number of warrant shares represent 14.0% of the common stock of the company on a fully diluted basis (not including preferred stock outstanding after such event unless such preferred stock has been converted into common stock), after giving effect to the events described in this section 4.4(c), which will be reflected on an addendum to this warrant that the company will provide as provided in the next sentence. each month beginning on the date that is one month after the date hereof, and on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, the company shall deliver to the holder a statement setting forth the capital structure of the company on such date and a description of all of the events requiring an adjustment or recalculation to this warrant pursuant to this section 4.4(c) and the method by which each such adjustment or recalculation was calculated which statement shall be certified by the company's chief financial officer and chief executive officer. (d) in the event any amounts owing under the note are repaid within nine (9) months of the closing date pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, the number of warrant shares represented by this warrant shall be adjusted on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, by multiplying the number of warrant shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount repaid pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, and the denominator of which is 12,000,000. the resulting number shall be the adjusted number of warrant shares. 14 4.5 dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up. if at any time there is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up of the company, other than as contemplated by section 4.4, then the company shall cause to be mailed (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) to the holder at the holder's address as shown on the warrant register, at the earliest practicable time (and, in any event, not less than thirty (30) calendar days before any date set for definitive action) written notice of the date on which such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up shall take place, as the case may be. such notice shall also specify the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities, money or other property deliverable upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be. on such date, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender of this warrant the cash or other property, less the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, that the holder would have been entitled to receive had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding- up. upon receipt of the cash or other property, any and all rights of the holder to exercise this warrant shall terminate in their entirety. if the cash or other property distributable in the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up has a fair market value which is less than the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, this warrant shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. 4.6 other dilutive events. if any event occurs as to which the other provisions of this section 4 are not strictly applicable but as to which the failure to make any adjustment would not protect the purchase rights represented by this warrant in accordance with the intent and principles hereof, then, in each such case, the holder (or if this warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for the purchase of more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants) may demand that the company engage, and the company shall engage within fifteen (15) days of such demand, an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing which shall give its opinion as to the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the intent and principles established herein, necessary to preserve the purchase rights represented by this warrant (or such warrants). upon receipt of such opinion, the company will mail (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a copy thereof to the holder within three (3) business days and shall make the adjustments described therein. the fees and expenses of such investment banking or accounting firm shall be borne by the company. 4.7 other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the adjustments provided for pursuant to this section 4: (a) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring such an 15 adjustment shall occur. for the purpose of any such adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. (b) record date. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them to (i) receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock or in shares of any other class or series of capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or shares of any other class or series of capital stock or (ii) subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or such other shares or securities, then all references in this section 4 to the date of the issuance or sale of such shares of common stock or such other shares or securities shall be deemed to be references to that record date. (c) when adjustment not required. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights to which the provisions of section 4.1 would apply, but shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (d) notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable or the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted or recalculated pursuant to this section 4, the company shall immediately, but in no event in more than two (2) business days, prepare a certificate to be executed by the chief financial officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment or recalculation and the method by which such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, specifying the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable and (if such adjustment was made pursuant to section 4.4) describing the number and kind of any other shares of stock or other property for which this warrant is exercisable, and any related change in the warrant purchase price, after giving effect to such adjustment, recalculation or change. the company shall mail (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a signed copy of the certificate to be delivered to the holder within three (3) business days of the event which caused the adjustment or recalculation. the company shall keep at the designated office copies of all such certificates and cause them to be available for inspection at the designated office during normal business hours by the holder or any prospective transferee of this warrant designated by the holder. (e) challenge to good faith determination. whenever the board of directors of the company is required to make a determination in good faith of the fair market value of this warrant or the warrant shares under this section 4, such determination may be challenged or disputed by the holder (or if the warrant has been divided up, the holders of 16 warrants exercisable for more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants). if the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) wishes to challenge or dispute any such fair market value determination, it (or they) shall furnish written notice to the company of its (or their) intention to challenge the same. if the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) cannot resolve the dispute between or among themselves, then such dispute shall be submitted for final determination to an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing pursuant to the valuation procedures set forth in clause (ii) under the definition of fair market value. the company shall bear any and all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) in connection with such dispute and determination, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of any investment banking, valuation or accounting firm(s) engaged by the company or the holder (or holders, as the case may be) and of attorneys in connection with such dispute and determination. (f) independent application. except as otherwise provided herein, all subsections of this section 4 are intended to operate independently of one another (but without duplication). if an event occurs that requires the application of more than one subsection, all applicable subsections shall be given independent effect without duplication. (g) other anti-dilution provisions. to the extent that levine leichtman capital partners ii, l.p. or any of its affiliates (collectively, "llcp") continues to hold this warrant, in whole or in part, at any time at which the company takes any action which would have resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price of, and the number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to, this warrant (a "dilutive issuance"), then, to the extent that llcp has exercised all or any portion of this warrant prior to such time, the company shall immediately issue to llcp upon such dilutive issuance, without the payment of any further consideration of any kind, such number of additional shares of common stock as shall equal the difference between (i) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant to the extent held unexercised by llcp at such time after giving effect to the adjustment thereto resulting from such dilutive issuance and (ii) the number of shares of common stock which would have been issuable upon exercise of this warrant after giving effect to such dilutive issuance if this warrant had not been exercised in any part. 4.8 fiduciary duties of company. the company and its directors shall owe the holder the same fiduciary duties that the company and its directors would owe to the warrant shares underlying the warrant. 5. miscellaneous. 5.1 restrictive legend. this warrant, any warrant issued upon transfer of this warrant and, unless registered under the securities act, any warrant shares issued upon exercise 17 of this warrant or any portion thereof shall be imprinted with the following legend, in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws: this warrant and the securities issuable upon exercise hereof have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or registered or qualified under any applicable state securities laws, and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned except in compliance with the registration requirements of such act and the registration or qualification requirements of such state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from such registration and qualification. the legend shall be appropriately modified upon issuance of certificates for shares of common stock. upon request of the holder of a common stock certificate, the company shall issue to that holder a new certificate free of the foregoing legend, if, with such request, such holder provides the company with an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the company (provided that riordan & mckinzie, a professional law corporation, shall be deemed to be acceptable to the company) to the effect that the securities evidenced by such certificate may be sold without restriction under rule 144 (or any other rule permitting resales of securities without restriction) promulgated under the securities act. 5.2 holder entitled to benefits under other agreements. the holder of this warrant (or, if the warrant has been divided up, the holders) is entitled to certain rights, benefits and privileges with respect to this warrant and the warrant shares pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement (it being understood that the warrant shares constitute "registrable securities" thereunder), the investor rights agreement and certain other investment documents. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the payment and performance of the put option is secured by a lien on the collateral pursuant to the collateral documents. 5.3 other covenants. without limiting the generality of section 5.2, the company covenants and agrees that, as long as this warrant remains outstanding or any warrant shares are issuable with respect to this warrant, the company will perform all of the following covenants for the express benefit of the holder: (a) the warrant shares shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock;

(b) if at any time the company makes a distribution to its stockholders (other than in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company) of any asset (including cash) or security or redeems the class a preferred in accordance with its terms (collectively, a "distribution") (the total of the assets or securities so distributed, the "distribution amount") other than those referred to in section 4.1 or section 4.3 or section 4.4, then, at the holder's option (provided that if the distribution is in cash, that the adjustment described in section 4.2(b)(ii) below shall not apply): 9 (i) the holder shall have the right to receive the portion of the distribution amount which a holder of the number of shares of class a preferred for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the distribution would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such distribution assuming, if the distribution is with respect to common stock, conversion of the class a preferred. upon the closing of the distribution, the company shall distribute such portion of the distribution amount to the holder; or (ii) the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted and shall be equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, multiplied by a fraction (which shall not be less than zero), the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of class a preferred on the date fixed for such determination, less the then-fair market value of the portion of the assets, or the fair market value of the portion of the securities, as the case may be, so distributed applicable to one share of class a preferred, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of class a preferred. such adjustment to the warrant purchase price shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day immediately following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. upon any adjustment to the warrant purchase price as provided for in this section 4.2(b)(ii), the number of shares of class a preferred issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall also be adjusted and shall be equal to the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. 4.3 issuance of equity securities under certain circumstances. (a) if, at any time after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell (or, in accordance with section 4.3(b), shall be deemed to have issued or sold) any shares of common stock (other than excluded securities) without consideration or for a consideration per share that is less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined as of the date of such issuance or sale, then, effective immediately upon such issuance or sale, the warrant purchase price shall be reduced (calculated to the nearest $.001 and without regard to any other provisions of this section 4) to an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately prior to such issuance or sale by (2) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale, plus (b) the cash consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale, and the denominator of which shall be the product obtained by multiplying (c) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately 10 after such sale or issuance, by (d) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale. upon each such adjustment of the warrant purchase price hereunder, the number of warrant shares which may be obtained upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number of shares determined by multiplying (x) the number of warrant shares which could be obtained upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately after such adjustment. adjustments shall be made successively whenever such an issuance or sale is made. (b) for the purpose of determining the adjusted warrant purchase price under section 4.3(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of option rights. if the company in any manner issues or grants any option rights or convertible securities and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such option rights or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of such issuance or grant of such option rights, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such option rights (or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such option rights) shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon exercise of option rights or upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities issuable upon exercise of option rights shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuing or granting of such option rights, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such option rights, plus in the case of such option rights which relate to convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such option rights or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any manner issues or grants any convertible securities having an exercise or conversion or exchange price per share of common stock which is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of issuance or sale, then the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is 11 issuable upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities is determined by dividing (a) the total amount received by the company as consideration for the issuance or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. (iii) change in equity price or conversion rate. if the purchase price provided for in any option rights, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock decreases at any time, then the warrant purchase price in effect at the time of such decrease shall be readjusted to the warrant purchase price which would have been in effect at such time had such option rights or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such decreased purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold and the number of warrant shares shall be correspondingly readjusted, by taking the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. (iv) calculation of consideration received. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, then the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold for consideration other than cash, then the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). (v) intentionally omitted. (vi) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, option rights or convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, option rights or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such distribution or the date of the granting or such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. 12 (c) no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 4.3 with respect to the issuance of excluded shares. 4.4 reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. (a) if at any time prior to the expiration date, the company reorganizes its capital, reclassifies its capital stock, consolidates, merges or combines with or into another person (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is any change whatsoever in, or distribution with respect to, the outstanding common stock), or the company sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its property, assets or business to another person, other than in a transaction provided for in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 or 4.6, or other than the tender offer merger, and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale, transfer or other disposition of assets, (i) shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or of the company (if it is the surviving corporation) or (ii) any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or the company ("other property") are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock who are holders immediately prior to such transaction, then the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of common stock, common stock of the successor or acquiring person, and/or other property which holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such event. in such event, the aggregate warrant purchase price otherwise payable for the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be allocated among such securities and other property in proportion to the respective fair market values of such securities and other property as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). if, in connection with the tender offer merger, the company creates a new entity ("newco") and richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden exchange the capital stock held by them for equity securities of newco, the company shall not participate in the formation of newco without the express written consent of llcp in its sole discretion unless (i) this warrant is exchanged for a like warrant of newco and the capital structure of newco is identical to the capital structure of the company with respect to capital stock held by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden and llcp has the right to exchange this warrant and any shares of common stock or preferred stock it holds on the same basis as richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden, (ii) the exchange of this warrant for a like warrant of newco is tax-free to the holder, as determined by llcp in its discretion, (iii) a new warrant for common stock of newco is issued to the holder that is identical to this warrant and such warrant shall preserve the rights and privileges of this warrant and (iv) after such exchange, the number of equity securities 13 owned by the holder in relationship to the number of equity securities owned by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden is not diminished in any way. (b) in case of any such event, the successor or acquiring person (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as the holder may approve in writing (and memorialized by resolutions of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of any shares of common stock of such successor or acquiring person for which this warrant thus becomes exercisable, which modifications shall be as equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4.4. for purposes of this section 4, "common stock of the successor or acquiring person" shall include stock or other equity securities, or securities that are exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into equity securities, of such corporation, or other securities if such person is not a corporation, of any class that is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation or person and that is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.4 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets. (c) if the number of shares of common stock held by shareholders of the company other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden is reduced within nine (9) months of the date hereof due to (i) the consummation of the tender offer or the tender offer merger; (ii) purchases by the company of its common stock pursuant to rule 10b-18 of the exchange act other than from richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; (iii) private purchases by the company of its common stock from shareholders other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; or (iv) whether before or after nine (9) months from the date hereof, purchases of common stock by the company from richard f. schaden in compliance with the terms of the subordinated indebtedness set forth in sections 10.1 and 10.4 of the securities purchase agreement, and such reduced shares are retired or otherwise no longer outstanding after such merger or repurchase, the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant shall be reduced so that the number of warrant shares represent 14.0% of the class a preferred of the company on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the events described in this section 4.4(c). adjustments made pursuant to this section 4.4(c) will be reflected on an addendum to this warrant that the company will provide as provided in the next sentence. each month beginning on the date that is one month after the date hereof, and on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, the company shall deliver to the holder a statement setting forth the capital structure of the company on such date and a description of all of the events 14 requiring an adjustment or recalculation to this warrant pursuant to this section 4.4(c) and the method by which each such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, which statement shall be certified by the company's chief financial officer and chief executive officer. (d) in the event any amounts owing under the note are repaid within nine (9) months of the closing date pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, the number of warrant shares represented by this warrant shall be adjusted on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, by multiplying the number of warrant shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount repaid pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, and the denominator of which is 12,000,000. the resulting number shall be the adjusted number of warrant shares. 4.5 dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up. if at any time there is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up of the company, other than as contemplated by section 4.4, then the company shall cause to be mailed (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) to the holder at the holder's address as shown on the warrant register, at the earliest practicable time (and, in any event, not less than thirty (30) calendar days before any date set for definitive action) written notice of the date on which such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up shall take place, as the case may be. such notice shall also specify the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities, money or other property deliverable upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be. on such date, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender of this warrant the cash or other property, less the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, that the holder would have been entitled to receive had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding- up. upon receipt of the cash or other property, any and all rights of the holder to exercise this warrant shall terminate in their entirety. if the cash or other property distributable in the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up has a fair market value which is less than the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, this warrant shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. 4.6 other dilutive events. if any event occurs as to which the other provisions of this section 4 are not strictly applicable but as to which the failure to make any adjustment would not protect the purchase rights represented by this warrant in accordance with the intent and principles hereof, then, in each such case, the holder (or if this warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for the purchase of more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants) may demand that the company engage, and the company shall engage within fifteen (15) days of such demand, an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing which shall give its opinion as to the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the intent and principles established herein, necessary to preserve the purchase rights represented by this warrant (or such warrants). upon receipt of such opinion, the company will mail (by 15 registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a copy thereof to the holder within three (3) business days and shall make the adjustments described therein. the fees and expenses of such investment banking or accounting firm shall be borne by the company. 4.7 other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the adjustments provided for pursuant to this section 4: (a) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring such an adjustment shall occur. for the purpose of any such adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. (b) record date. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to (i) receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock or in shares of any other class or series of capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or shares of any other class or series of capital stock or (ii) subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or such other shares or securities, then all references in this section 4 to the date of the issuance or sale of such shares of capital stock or such other shares or securities shall be deemed to be references to that record date. (c) when adjustment not required. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of its capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights to which the provisions of section 4.1 would apply, but shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (d) notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of capital stock for which this warrant is exercisable or the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted or recalculated pursuant to this section 4, the company shall immediately, but in no event in more than two (2) business days, prepare a certificate to be executed by the chief financial officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment or recalculation and the method by which such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, specifying the number of shares of capital stock for which this warrant is exercisable and (if such adjustment was made pursuant to section 4.4) describing the number and kind of any other shares of stock or other property for which this warrant is exercisable, and any related change in the warrant purchase price, after giving effect to such adjustment, recalculation or change. the 16 company shall mail (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a signed copy of the certificate to be delivered to the holder within three (3) business days of the event which caused the adjustment or recalculation. the company shall keep at the designated office copies of all such certificates and cause them to be available for inspection at the designated office during normal business hours by the holder or any prospective transferee of this warrant designated by the holder. (e) challenge to good faith determination. whenever the board of directors of the company is required to make a determination in good faith of the fair market value of this warrant or the warrant shares under this section 4, such determination may be challenged or disputed by the holder (or if the warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants). if the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) wishes to challenge or dispute any such fair market value determination, it (or they) shall furnish written notice to the company of its (or their) intention to challenge the same. if the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) cannot resolve the dispute between or among themselves, then such dispute shall be submitted for final determination to an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing pursuant to the valuation procedures set forth in clause (ii) under the definition of fair market value. the company shall bear any and all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) in connection with such dispute and determination, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of any investment banking, valuation or accounting firm(s) engaged by the company or the holder (or holders, as the case may be) and of attorneys in connection with such dispute and determination. (f) independent application. except as otherwise provided herein, all subsections of this section 4 are intended to operate independently of one another (but without duplication). if an event occurs that requires the application of more than one subsection, all applicable subsections shall be given independent effect without duplication. (g) other anti-dilution provisions. to the extent that levine leichtman capital partners ii, l.p. or any of its affiliates (collectively, "llcp") continues to hold this warrant, in whole or in part, at any time at which the company takes any action which would have resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price of, and the number of shares of capital stock issuable pursuant to, this warrant or conversion of the class a preferred (a "dilutive issuance"), then, to the extent that llcp has exercised all or any portion of this warrant prior to such time, the company shall immediately issue to llcp upon such dilutive issuance, without the payment of any further consideration of any kind, such number of additional shares of capital stock as shall equal the difference between (i) the number of shares of capital stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant to the extent held unexercised by llcp at such time after giving effect to the adjustment thereto resulting from such dilutive issuance and (ii) the number 17 of shares of capital stock which would have been issuable upon exercise of this warrant after giving effect to such dilutive issuance if this warrant had not been exercised in any part. 4.8 fiduciary duties of company. the company and its directors shall owe the holder the same fiduciary duties that the company and its directors would owe to the warrant shares underlying the warrant. 5. miscellaneous. 5.1 restrictive legend. this warrant, any warrant issued upon transfer of this warrant and, unless registered under the securities act, any warrant shares issued upon exercise of this warrant or any portion thereof shall be imprinted with the following legend, in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws: this warrant and the securities issuable upon exercise hereof have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or registered or qualified under any applicable state securities laws, and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned except in compliance with the registration requirements of such act and the registration or qualification requirements of such state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from such registration and qualification. the legend shall be appropriately modified upon issuance of certificates for shares of capital stock. upon request of the holder of a capital stock certificate, the company shall issue to that holder a new certificate free of the foregoing legend, if, with such request, such holder provides the company with an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the company (provided that riordan & mckinzie, a professional law corporation, shall be deemed to be acceptable to the company) to the effect that the securities evidenced by such certificate may be sold without restriction under rule 144 (or any other rule permitting resales of securities without restriction) promulgated under the securities act. 5.2 holder entitled to benefits under other agreements. the holder of this warrant (or, if the warrant has been divided up, the holders) is entitled to certain rights, benefits and privileges with respect to this warrant and the warrant shares pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement (it being understood that the 18 warrant shares constitute "registrable securities" thereunder), the investor rights agreement and certain other investment documents. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the payment and performance of the put option is secured by a lien on the collateral pursuant to the collateral documents. 5.3 other covenants. without limiting the generality of section 5.2, the company covenants and agrees that, as long as this warrant remains outstanding or any warrant shares are issuable with respect to this warrant, the company will perform all of the following covenants for the express benefit of the holder: (a) the warrant shares shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of capital stock; (b) each holder shall, upon the exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof, receive good and marketable title to the warrant shares, free and clear of all voting and other trust arrangements to which the company is a party or by which it is bound, preemptive rights of any stockholder, liens, encumbrances, equities and claims whatsoever, including, but not limited to, all taxes, liens and other charges with respect to the issuance thereof, other than as provided in the securities purchase agreement and related documents;

(d) the company shall deliver to each holder the information and reports described in section 9 of the securities purchase agreement as contemplated therein; (e) the company shall extend to the initial holder the management rights set forth in the investor rights agreement;

any of its rights, or delegate any of its obligations, under this warrant without the prior written consent of the holder (which consent may be withheld for any reason or no reason at all). subject to the requirements of applicable laws, the holder may assign this warrant, or delegate its obligations under this warrant, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, without the consent of the company; provided, however, that the holder may not assign or transfer all or any portion of this warrant to a competitor. each such assignment of this warrant, in whole or in part, shall be registered on the books of the company to be maintained for such purpose, upon surrender of this warrant at the designated office, together with appropriate instruments of assignment, duly completed and executed. upon such surrender, the company shall, at its own expense, within three (3) business days of surrender, execute and deliver a new warrant or warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees specified in such assignment and in the denominations specified therein and this warrant shall promptly be canceled. if any portion of this warrant is not being assigned, the company shall, at its own expense, within three (3) business days issue to the holder a new warrant evidencing the portion not so assigned. if the holder assigns this warrant to one or more persons, any decisions that the holder is entitled to make at any time hereunder shall be made by the holders holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants. this warrant shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the company, the holder and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and shall include, with respect to the company, any person succeeding the company by merger, consolidation, combination or acquisition of all or substantially all of the company's assets, and in such case, except as expressly provided herein and in the securities purchase agreement, all of the obligations of the company hereunder shall survive such merger, consolidation, combination or acquisition. in the event that the holder assigns a portion of its rights under this warrant, the rights with respect to determining fair market value, as well as the rights under section 4.6 and section 4.7(e) will be exercised by the holders of warrants exercisable for more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants, who will act as the representative of all holders (the "representative holder"). the representative holder will represent all holders in any meetings or negotiations related to the events giving rise to a fair market valuation or determinations under section 4.6 or section 4.7(e). the company will not be liable for expenses incurred by the holders other than 21 the representative holder (including, without limitation, expenses associated with additional investment banking firms or accountants engaged by or at the request of holders other than the representative holder). 5.10 captions; construction and interpretation. the captions in this warrant are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a part of this agreement and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this warrant. all section, preamble, recital, exhibit, schedule, disclosure schedule, annex, clause and party references are to this warrant unless otherwise stated. no party, nor its counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this warrant for purposes of construing the provisions of this warrant, and all provisions of this warrant shall be construed in accordance with their fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. 5.11 lost warrant or certificates. upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this warrant or of a stock certificate evidencing warrant shares and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this warrant or stock certificate, the company shall make and deliver to the holder, within three (3) business days of receipt by the company of such documentation, a new warrant or stock certificate, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated warrant or stock certificate. 5.12 no impairment. the company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its charter documents or regulations or through any reorganization, reclassification, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of the holder against impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company will (i) not increase the par value (if any) of any shares of capital stock receivable upon the exercise of this warrant above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of capital stock upon the exercise of this warrant, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities and claims, and (iii) use its best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the company to perform its obligations under this warrant. 5.13 governing law. in all respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, this warrant and the rights and obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the 22 state of california applicable to contracts made and performed in the state of california, without regard to principles thereof regarding conflicts of laws or choice of law, and any applicable laws of the united states of america. 5.14 remedies. if the company fails to perform, comply with or observe any covenant or agreement to be performed, complied with or observed by it under this warrant, the holder may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity or action at law, whether for specific performance of any term contained in this warrant or for an injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this warrant or to enforce any other legal or equitable right, or to take any one or more of such actions. the company hereby agrees that the holder shall not be required or otherwise obligated to, and hereby waives any right to demand that the holder, post any performance or other bond in connection with the enforcement of its rights and remedies hereunder. the company agrees to pay all fees, costs, and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts retained by the holder, and all fees, costs and expenses of appeals, incurred or expended by the holder in connection with the enforcement of this warrant or the collection of any sums due hereunder, whether or not suit is commenced. none of the rights, powers or remedies conferred under this warrant shall be mutually exclusive, and each right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right, power or remedy whether conferred by this warrant or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. 5.15 waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the company and the holder wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the company and the holder desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, and understanding they are waiving a constitutional right, the company and the holder (by acceptance hereof) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit, or proceeding brought to resolve any dispute, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising out of, connected with, related to, or incidental to, this warrant, the warrant shares, the securities purchase agreement and/or any other investment document, or the transactions completed hereby or thereby. 23 in witness whereof, the company has caused this warrant to be executed and

distribution of assets or securities, redemption of class c preferred. (a) if at any time the company issues (without payment of any consideration) to all holders of outstanding class c preferred any option rights, or any option rights to holders of outstanding common stock to which holders of class c preferred are entitled pursuant to the terms of the class c preferred, then the company shall also distribute such option rights to the holder as if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such issuance. any reduction by the company in the exercise price of any existing option rights shall be treated as a new issuance of option rights and the provisions of this section 4.2(a) shall apply. (b) if at any time the company makes a distribution to its stockholders (other than in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company) of any asset (including cash) or security or redeems the class c preferred in accordance with its terms (collectively, a "distribution") (the total of the assets or securities so distributed, the "distribution amount") other than those referred to in section 4.1 or section 4.3 or section 4.4, then, at the holder's option (provided that if the distribution is in cash, that the adjustment described in section 4.2(b)(ii) below shall not apply): 9 (i) the holder shall have the right to receive the portion of the distribution amount which a holder of the number of shares of class c preferred for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the distribution would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such distribution assuming, if the distribution is with respect to common stock, conversion of the class c preferred. upon the closing of the distribution, the company shall distribute such portion of the distribution amount to the holder; or (ii) the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted and shall be equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, multiplied by a fraction (which shall not be less than zero), the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of class c preferred on the date fixed for such determination, less the then-fair market value of the portion of the assets, or the fair market value of the portion of the securities, as the case may be, so distributed applicable to one share of class c preferred, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of class c preferred. such adjustment to the warrant purchase price shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day immediately following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. upon any adjustment to the warrant purchase price as provided for in this section 4.2(b)(ii), the number of shares of class c preferred issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall also be adjusted and shall be equal to the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. 4.3 issuance of equity securities under certain circumstances. (a) if, at any time after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell (or, in accordance with section 4.3(b), shall be deemed to have issued or sold) any shares of common stock (other than excluded securities) without consideration or for a consideration per share that is less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined as of the date of such issuance or sale, then, effective immediately upon such issuance or sale, the warrant purchase price shall be reduced (calculated to the nearest $.001 and without regard to any other provisions of this section 4) to an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately prior to such issuance or sale by (2) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale, plus (b) the cash consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale, and the denominator of which shall be the product obtained by multiplying (c) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately 10 after such sale or issuance, by (d) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale. upon each such adjustment of the warrant purchase price hereunder, the number of warrant shares which may be obtained upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number of shares determined by multiplying (x) the number of warrant shares which could be obtained upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately after such adjustment. adjustments shall be made successively whenever such an issuance or sale is made. (b) for the purpose of determining the adjusted warrant purchase price under section 4.3(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of option rights. if the company in any manner issues or grants any option rights or convertible securities and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such option rights or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of such issuance or grant of such option rights, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such option rights (or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such option rights) shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon exercise of option rights or upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities issuable upon exercise of option rights shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuing or granting of such option rights, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such option rights, plus in the case of such option rights which relate to convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such option rights or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any manner issues or grants any convertible securities having an exercise or conversion or exchange price per share of common stock which is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of issuance or sale, then the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is 11 issuable upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities is determined by dividing (a) the total amount received by the company as consideration for the issuance or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. (iii) change in equity price or conversion rate. if the purchase price provided for in any option rights, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock decreases at any time, then the warrant purchase price in effect at the time of such decrease shall be readjusted to the warrant purchase price which would have been in effect at such time had such option rights or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such decreased purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold and the number of warrant shares shall be correspondingly readjusted, by taking the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. (iv) calculation of consideration received. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, then the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold for consideration other than cash, then the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). (v) intentionally omitted. (vi) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, option rights or convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, option rights or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such distribution or the date of the granting or such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. 12 (c) no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 4.3 with respect to the issuance of excluded shares. 4.4 reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. (a) if at any time prior to the expiration date, the company reorganizes its capital, reclassifies its capital stock, consolidates, merges or combines with or into another person (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is any change whatsoever in, or distribution with respect to, the outstanding common stock), or the company sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its property, assets or business to another person, other than in a transaction provided for in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 or 4.6, or other than the tender offer merger, and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale, transfer or other disposition of assets, (i) shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or of the company (if it is the surviving corporation) or (ii) any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or the company ("other property") are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock who are holders immediately prior to such transaction, then the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of common stock, common stock of the successor or acquiring person, and/or other property which holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such event. in such event, the aggregate warrant purchase price otherwise payable for the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be allocated among such securities and other property in proportion to the respective fair market values of such securities and other property as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). if, in connection with the tender offer merger, the company creates a new entity ("newco") and richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden exchange the capital stock held by them for equity securities of newco, the company shall not participate in the formation of newco without the express written consent of llcp in its sole discretion unless (i) this warrant is exchanged for a like warrant of newco and the capital structure of newco is identical to the capital structure of the company with respect to capital stock held by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden and llcp has the right to exchange this warrant and any shares of common stock or preferred stock it holds on the same basis as richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden, (ii) the exchange of this warrant for a like warrant of newco is tax-free to the holder, as determined by llcp in its discretion, (iii) a new warrant for common stock of newco is issued to the holder that is identical to this warrant and such warrant shall preserve the rights and privileges of this warrant and (iv) after such exchange, the number of equity securities 13 owned by the holder in relationship to the number of equity securities owned by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden is not diminished in any way. (b) in case of any such event, the successor or acquiring person (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as the holder may approve in writing (and memorialized by resolutions of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of any shares of common stock of such successor or acquiring person for which this warrant thus becomes exercisable, which modifications shall be as equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4.4. for purposes of this section 4, "common stock of the successor or acquiring person" shall include stock or other equity securities, or securities that are exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into equity securities, of such corporation, or other securities if such person is not a corporation, of any class that is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation or person and that is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.4 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets. (c) if the number of shares of common stock held by shareholders of the company other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden is reduced within nine (9) months of the date hereof due to (i) the consummation of the tender offer or the tender offer merger; (ii) purchases by the company of its common stock pursuant to rule 10b-18 of the exchange act other than from richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; (iii) private purchases by the company of its common stock from shareholders other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; or (iv) whether before or after nine (9) months from the date hereof, purchases of common stock by the company from richard f. schaden in compliance with the terms of the subordinated indebtedness set forth in sections 10.1 and 10.4 of the securities purchase agreement, and such reduced shares are retired or otherwise no longer outstanding after such merger or repurchase, the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant shall be reduced so that the number of warrant shares represent 14.0% of the class c preferred of the company on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the events described in this section 4.4(c). adjustments made pursuant to this section 4.4(c) will be reflected on an addendum to this warrant that the company will provide as provided in the next sentence. each month beginning on the date that is one month after the date hereof, and on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, the company shall deliver to the holder a statement setting forth the capital structure of the company on such date and a description of all of the events 14 requiring an adjustment or recalculation to this warrant pursuant to this section 4.4(c) and the method by which each such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, which statement shall be certified by the company's chief financial officer and chief executive officer. (d) in the event any amounts owing under the note are repaid within nine (9) months of the closing date pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, the number of warrant shares represented by this warrant shall be adjusted on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, by multiplying the number of warrant shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount repaid pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, and the denominator of which is 12,000,000. the resulting number shall be the adjusted number of warrant shares. 4.5 dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up. if at any time there is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up of the company, other than as contemplated by section 4.4, then the company shall cause to be mailed (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) to the holder at the holder's address as shown on the warrant register, at the earliest practicable time (and, in any event, not less than thirty (30) calendar days before any date set for definitive action) written notice of the date on which such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up shall take place, as the case may be. such notice shall also specify the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities, money or other property deliverable upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be. on such date, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender of this warrant the cash or other property, less the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, that the holder would have been entitled to receive had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding- up. upon receipt of the cash or other property, any and all rights of the holder to exercise this warrant shall terminate in their entirety. if the cash or other property distributable in the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up has a fair market value which is less than the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, this warrant shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. 4.6 other dilutive events. if any event occurs as to which the other provisions of this section 4 are not strictly applicable but as to which the failure to make any adjustment would not protect the purchase rights represented by this warrant in accordance with the intent and principles hereof, then, in each such case, the holder (or if this warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for the purchase of more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants) may demand that the company engage, and the company shall engage within fifteen (15) days of such demand, an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing which shall give its opinion as to the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the intent and principles established herein, necessary to preserve the purchase rights represented by this warrant (or such warrants). upon receipt of such opinion, the company will mail (by 15 registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a copy thereof to the holder within three (3) business days and shall make the adjustments described therein. the fees and expenses of such investment banking or accounting firm shall be borne by the company. 4.7 other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the adjustments provided for pursuant to this section 4: (a) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring such an adjustment shall occur. for the purpose of any such adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. (b) record date. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to (i) receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock or in shares of any other class or series of capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or shares of any other class or series of capital stock or (ii) subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or such other shares or securities, then all references in this section 4 to the date of the issuance or sale of such shares of capital stock or such other shares or securities shall be deemed to be references to that record date. (c) when adjustment not required. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of its capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights to which the provisions of section 4.1 would apply, but shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (d) notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of capital stock for which this warrant is exercisable or the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted or recalculated pursuant to this section 4, the company shall immediately, but in no event in more than two (2) business days, prepare a certificate to be executed by the chief financial officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment or recalculation and the method by which such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, specifying the number of shares of capital stock for which this warrant is exercisable and (if such adjustment was made pursuant to section 4.4) describing the number and kind of any other shares of stock or other property for which this warrant is exercisable, and any related change in the warrant purchase price, after giving effect to such adjustment, recalculation or change. the 16 company shall mail (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a signed copy of the certificate to be delivered to the holder within three (3) business days of the event which caused the adjustment or recalculation. the company shall keep at the designated office copies of all such certificates and cause them to be available for inspection at the designated office during normal business hours by the holder or any prospective transferee of this warrant designated by the holder. (e) challenge to good faith determination. whenever the board of directors of the company is required to make a determination in good faith of the fair market value of this warrant or the warrant shares under this section 4, such determination may be challenged or disputed by the holder (or if the warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants). if the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) wishes to challenge or dispute any such fair market value determination, it (or they) shall furnish written notice to the company of its (or their) intention to challenge the same. if the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) cannot resolve the dispute between or among themselves, then such dispute shall be submitted for final determination to an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing pursuant to the valuation procedures set forth in clause (ii) under the definition of fair market value. the company shall bear any and all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) in connection with such dispute and determination, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of any investment banking, valuation or accounting firm(s) engaged by the company or the holder (or holders, as the case may be) and of attorneys in connection with such dispute and determination. (f) independent application. except as otherwise provided herein, all subsections of this section 4 are intended to operate independently of one another (but without duplication). if an event occurs that requires the application of more than one subsection, all applicable subsections shall be given independent effect without duplication. (g) other anti-dilution provisions. to the extent that levine leichtman capital partners ii, l.p. or any of its affiliates (collectively, "llcp") continues to hold this warrant, in whole or in part, at any time at which the company takes any action which would have resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price of, and the number of shares of capital stock issuable pursuant to, this warrant or conversion of the class c preferred (a "dilutive issuance"), then, to the extent that llcp has exercised all or any portion of this warrant prior to such time, the company shall immediately issue to llcp upon such dilutive issuance, without the payment of any further consideration of any kind, such number of additional shares of capital stock as shall equal the difference between (i) the number of shares of capital stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant to the extent held unexercised by llcp at such time after giving effect to the adjustment thereto resulting from such dilutive issuance and (ii) the number 17 of shares of capital stock which would have been issuable upon exercise of this warrant after giving effect to such dilutive issuance if this warrant had not been exercised in any part. 4.8 fiduciary duties of company. the company and its directors shall owe the holder the same fiduciary duties that the company and its directors would owe to the warrant shares underlying the warrant. 5. miscellaneous. 5.1 restrictive legend. this warrant, any warrant issued upon transfer of this warrant and, unless registered under the securities act, any warrant shares issued upon exercise of this warrant or any portion thereof shall be imprinted with the following legend, in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws: this warrant and the securities issuable upon exercise hereof have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or registered or qualified under any applicable state securities laws, and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned except in compliance with the registration requirements of such act and the registration or qualification requirements of such state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from such registration and qualification. the legend shall be appropriately modified upon issuance of certificates for shares of capital stock. upon request of the holder of a capital stock certificate, the company shall issue to that holder a new certificate free of the foregoing legend, if, with such request, such holder provides the company with an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the company (provided that riordan & mckinzie, a professional law corporation, shall be deemed to be acceptable to the company) to the effect that the securities evidenced by such certificate may be sold without restriction under rule 144 (or any other rule permitting resales of securities without restriction) promulgated under the securities act. 5.2 holder entitled to benefits under other agreements. the holder of this warrant (or, if the warrant has been divided up, the holders) is entitled to certain rights, benefits and privileges with respect to this warrant and the warrant shares pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement (it being understood that the 18 warrant shares constitute "registrable securities" thereunder), the investor rights agreement and certain other investment documents. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the payment and performance of the put option is secured by a lien on the collateral pursuant to the collateral documents. 5.3 other covenants. without limiting the generality of section 5.2, the company covenants and agrees that, as long as this warrant remains outstanding or any warrant shares are issuable with respect to this warrant, the company will perform all of the following covenants for the express benefit of the holder: (a) the warrant shares shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of capital stock;

the requirements of applicable laws, the holder may assign this warrant, or delegate its obligations under this warrant, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, without the consent of the company; provided, however, that the holder may not assign or transfer all or any portion of this warrant to a competitor. each such assignment of this warrant, in whole or in part, shall be registered on the books of the company to be maintained for such purpose, upon surrender of this warrant at the designated office, together with appropriate instruments of assignment, duly completed and executed. upon such surrender, the company shall, at its own expense, within three (3) business days of surrender, execute and deliver a new warrant or warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees specified in such assignment and in the denominations specified therein and this warrant shall promptly be canceled. if any portion of this warrant is not being assigned, the company shall, at its own expense, within three (3) business days issue to the holder a new warrant evidencing the portion not so assigned. if the holder assigns this warrant to one or more persons, any decisions that the holder is entitled to make at any time hereunder shall be made by the holders holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants. this warrant shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the company, the holder and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and shall include, with respect to the company, any person succeeding the company by merger, consolidation, combination or acquisition of all or substantially all of the company's assets, and in such case, except as expressly provided herein and in the securities purchase agreement, all of the obligations of the company hereunder shall survive such merger, consolidation, combination or acquisition. in the event

exercised by the holders of warrants exercisable for more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants, who will act as the representative of all holders (the "representative holder"). the representative holder will represent all holders in any meetings or negotiations related to the events giving rise to a fair market valuation or determinations under section 4.6 or section 4.7(e). the company will not be liable for expenses incurred by the holders other than 21 the representative holder (including, without limitation, expenses associated with additional investment banking firms or accountants engaged by or at the request of holders other than the representative holder). 5.10 captions; construction and interpretation. the captions in this warrant are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a part of this agreement and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this warrant. all section, preamble, recital, exhibit, schedule, disclosure schedule, annex, clause and party references are to this warrant unless otherwise stated. no party, nor its counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this warrant for purposes of construing the provisions of this warrant, and all provisions of this warrant shall be construed in accordance with their fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. 5.11 lost warrant or certificates. upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this warrant or of a stock certificate evidencing warrant shares and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this warrant or stock certificate, the company shall make and deliver to the holder, within three (3) business days of receipt by the company of such documentation, a new warrant or stock certificate, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated warrant or stock certificate. 5.12 no impairment. the company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its charter documents or regulations or through any reorganization, reclassification, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of the holder against impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company will (i) not increase the par value (if any) of any shares of capital stock receivable upon the exercise of this warrant above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of capital stock upon the exercise of this warrant, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities and claims, and (iii) use its best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the company to perform its obligations under this warrant. 5.13 governing law. in all respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, this warrant and the rights and obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the 22 state of california applicable to contracts made and performed in the state of california, without regard to principles thereof regarding conflicts of laws or choice of law, and any applicable laws of the united states of america. 5.14 remedies. if the company fails to perform, comply with or observe any covenant or agreement to be performed, complied with or observed by it under this warrant, the holder may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity or action at law, whether for specific performance of any term contained in this warrant or for an injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this warrant or to enforce any other legal or equitable right, or to take any one or more of such actions. the company hereby agrees that the holder shall not be required or otherwise obligated to, and hereby waives any right to demand that the holder, post any performance or other bond in connection with the enforcement of its rights and remedies hereunder. the company agrees to pay all fees, costs, and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts retained by the holder, and all fees, costs and expenses of appeals, incurred or expended by the holder in connection with the enforcement of this warrant or the collection of any sums due hereunder, whether or not suit is commenced. none of the rights, powers or remedies conferred under this warrant shall be mutually exclusive, and each right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right, power or remedy whether conferred by this warrant or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. 5.15 waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the company and the holder wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the company and the holder desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, and understanding they are waiving a constitutional right, the company and the holder (by acceptance hereof) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit, or proceeding brought to resolve any dispute, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising out of, connected with, related to, or incidental to, this warrant, the warrant shares, the securities purchase agreement and/or any other investment document, or the transactions completed hereby or thereby. 23 in witness whereof, the company has caused this warrant to be executed and

distribution of assets or securities, redemption of class d preferred. (a) if at any time the company issues (without payment of any consideration) to all holders of outstanding class d preferred any option rights, or any option rights to holders of outstanding common stock to which holders of class d preferred are entitled pursuant to the terms of the class d preferred, then the company shall also distribute such option rights to the holder as if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such issuance. any reduction by the company in the exercise price of any existing option rights shall be treated as a new issuance of option rights and the provisions of this section 4.2(a) shall apply. (b) if at any time the company makes a distribution to its stockholders (other than in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company) of any asset (including cash) or security or redeems the class d preferred in accordance with its terms (collectively, a "distribution") (the total of the assets or securities so distributed, the "distribution amount") other than those referred to in section 4.1 or section 4.3 or section 4.4, then, at the holder's option (provided that if the distribution is in cash, that the adjustment described in section 4.2(b)(ii) below shall not apply): 9 (i) the holder shall have the right to receive the portion of the distribution amount which a holder of the number of shares of class d preferred for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the distribution would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such distribution assuming, if the distribution is with respect to common stock, conversion of the class d preferred. upon the closing of the distribution, the company shall distribute such portion of the distribution amount to the holder; or (ii) the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted and shall be equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, multiplied by a fraction (which shall not be less than zero), the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of class d preferred on the date fixed for such determination, less the then-fair market value of the portion of the assets, or the fair market value of the portion of the securities, as the case may be, so distributed applicable to one share of class d preferred, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of class d preferred. such adjustment to the warrant purchase price shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day immediately following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. upon any adjustment to the warrant purchase price as provided for in this section 4.2(b)(ii), the number of shares of class d preferred issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall also be adjusted and shall be equal to the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. 4.3 issuance of equity securities under certain circumstances. (a) if, at any time after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell (or, in accordance with section 4.3(b), shall be deemed to have issued or sold) any shares of common stock (other than excluded securities) without consideration or for a consideration per share that is less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined as of the date of such issuance or sale, then, effective immediately upon such issuance or sale, the warrant purchase price shall be reduced (calculated to the nearest $.001 and without regard to any other provisions of this section 4) to an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately prior to such issuance or sale by (2) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale, plus (b) the cash consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale, and the denominator of which shall be the product obtained by multiplying (c) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately 10 after such sale or issuance, by (d) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale. upon each such adjustment of the warrant purchase price hereunder, the number of warrant shares which may be obtained upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number of shares determined by multiplying (x) the number of warrant shares which could be obtained upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately after such adjustment. adjustments shall be made successively whenever such an issuance or sale is made. (b) for the purpose of determining the adjusted warrant purchase price under section 4.3(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of option rights. if the company in any manner issues or grants any option rights or convertible securities and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such option rights or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of such issuance or grant of such option rights, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such option rights (or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such option rights) shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon exercise of option rights or upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities issuable upon exercise of option rights shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuing or granting of such option rights, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such option rights, plus in the case of such option rights which relate to convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such option rights or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any manner issues or grants any convertible securities having an exercise or conversion or exchange price per share of common stock which is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of issuance or sale, then the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is 11 issuable upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities is determined by dividing (a) the total amount received by the company as consideration for the issuance or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. (iii) change in equity price or conversion rate. if the purchase price provided for in any option rights, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock decreases at any time, then the warrant purchase price in effect at the time of such decrease shall be readjusted to the warrant purchase price which would have been in effect at such time had such option rights or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such decreased purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold and the number of warrant shares shall be correspondingly readjusted, by taking the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. (iv) calculation of consideration received. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, then the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold for consideration other than cash, then the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). (v) intentionally omitted. (vi) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, option rights or convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, option rights or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such distribution or the date of the granting or such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. 12 (c) no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 4.3 with respect to the issuance of excluded shares. 4.4 reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. (a) if at any time prior to the expiration date, the company reorganizes its capital, reclassifies its capital stock, consolidates, merges or combines with or into another person (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is any change whatsoever in, or distribution with respect to, the outstanding common stock), or the company sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its property, assets or business to another person, other than in a transaction provided for in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 or 4.6, or other than the tender offer merger, and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale, transfer or other disposition of assets, (i) shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or of the company (if it is the surviving corporation) or (ii) any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or the company ("other property") are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock who are holders immediately prior to such transaction, then the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of common stock, common stock of the successor or acquiring person, and/or other property which holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such event. in such event, the aggregate warrant purchase price otherwise payable for the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be allocated among such securities and other property in proportion to the respective fair market values of such securities and other property as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). if, in connection with the tender offer merger, the company creates a new entity ("newco") and richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden exchange the capital stock held by them for equity securities of newco, the company shall not participate in the formation of newco without the express written consent of llcp in its sole discretion unless (i) this warrant is exchanged for a like warrant of newco and the capital structure of newco is identical to the capital structure of the company with respect to capital stock held by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden and llcp has the right to exchange this warrant and any shares of common stock or preferred stock it holds on the same basis as richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden, (ii) the exchange of this warrant for a like warrant of newco is tax-free to the holder, as determined by llcp in its discretion, (iii) a new warrant for common stock of newco is issued to the holder that is identical to this warrant and such warrant shall preserve the rights and privileges of this warrant and (iv) after such exchange, the number of equity securities 13 owned by the holder in relationship to the number of equity securities owned by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden is not diminished in any way. (b) in case of any such event, the successor or acquiring person (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as the holder may approve in writing (and memorialized by resolutions of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of any shares of common stock of such successor or acquiring person for which this warrant thus becomes exercisable, which modifications shall be as equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4.4. for purposes of this section 4, "common stock of the successor or acquiring person" shall include stock or other equity securities, or securities that are exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into equity securities, of such corporation, or other securities if such person is not a corporation, of any class that is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation or person and that is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.4 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets. (c) if the number of shares of common stock held by shareholders of the company other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden is reduced within nine (9) months of the date hereof due to (i) the consummation of the tender offer or the tender offer merger; (ii) purchases by the company of its common stock pursuant to rule 10b-18 of the exchange act other than from richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; (iii) private purchases by the company of its common stock from shareholders other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; or (iv) whether before or after nine (9) months from the date hereof, purchases of common stock by the company from richard f. schaden in compliance with the terms of the subordinated indebtedness set forth in sections 10.1 and 10.4 of the securities purchase agreement, and such reduced shares are retired or otherwise no longer outstanding after such merger or repurchase, the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant shall be reduced so that the number of warrant shares represent 14.0% of the class d preferred of the company on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the events described in this section 4.4(c). adjustments made pursuant to this section 4.4(c) will be reflected on an addendum to this warrant that the company will provide as provided in the next sentence. each month beginning on the date that is one month after the date hereof, and on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, the company shall deliver to the holder a statement setting forth the capital structure of the company on such date and a description of all of the events 14 requiring an adjustment or recalculation to this warrant pursuant to this section 4.4(c) and the method by which each such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, which statement shall be certified by the company's chief financial officer and chief executive officer. (d) in the event any amounts owing under the note are repaid within nine (9) months of the closing date pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, the number of warrant shares represented by this warrant shall be adjusted on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, by multiplying the number of warrant shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount repaid pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, and the denominator of which is 12,000,000. the resulting number shall be the adjusted number of warrant shares. 4.5 dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up. if at any time there is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up of the company, other than as contemplated by section 4.4, then the company shall cause to be mailed (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) to the holder at the holder's address as shown on the warrant register, at the earliest practicable time (and, in any event, not less than thirty (30) calendar days before any date set for definitive action) written notice of the date on which such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up shall take place, as the case may be. such notice shall also specify the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities, money or other property deliverable upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be. on such date, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender of this warrant the cash or other property, less the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, that the holder would have been entitled to receive had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding- up. upon receipt of the cash or other property, any and all rights of the holder to exercise this warrant shall terminate in their entirety. if the cash or other property distributable in the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up has a fair market value which is less than the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, this warrant shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. 4.6 other dilutive events. if any event occurs as to which the other provisions of this section 4 are not strictly applicable but as to which the failure to make any adjustment would not protect the purchase rights represented by this warrant in accordance with the intent and principles hereof, then, in each such case, the holder (or if this warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for the purchase of more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants) may demand that the company engage, and the company shall engage within fifteen (15) days of such demand, an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing which shall give its opinion as to the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the intent and principles established herein, necessary to preserve the purchase rights represented by this warrant (or such warrants). upon receipt of such opinion, the company will mail (by 15 registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a copy thereof to the holder within three (3) business days and shall make the adjustments described therein. the fees and expenses of such investment banking or accounting firm shall be borne by the company. 4.7 other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the adjustments provided for pursuant to this section 4: (a) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring such an adjustment shall occur. for the purpose of any such adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. (b) record date. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to (i) receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock or in shares of any other class or series of capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or shares of any other class or series of capital stock or (ii) subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or such other shares or securities, then all references in this section 4 to the date of the issuance or sale of such shares of capital stock or such other shares or securities shall be deemed to be references to that record date. (c) when adjustment not required. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of its capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights to which the provisions of section 4.1 would apply, but shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (d) notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of capital stock for which this warrant is exercisable or the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted or recalculated pursuant to this section 4, the company shall immediately, but in no event in more than two (2) business days, prepare a certificate to be executed by the chief financial officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment or recalculation and the method by which such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, specifying the number of shares of capital stock for which this warrant is exercisable and (if such adjustment was made pursuant to section 4.4) describing the number and kind of any other shares of stock or other property for which this warrant is exercisable, and any related change in the warrant purchase price, after giving effect to such adjustment, recalculation or change. the 16 company shall mail (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a signed copy of the certificate to be delivered to the holder within three (3) business days of the event which caused the adjustment or recalculation. the company shall keep at the designated office copies of all such certificates and cause them to be available for inspection at the designated office during normal business hours by the holder or any prospective transferee of this warrant designated by the holder. (e) challenge to good faith determination. whenever the board of directors of the company is required to make a determination in good faith of the fair market value of this warrant or the warrant shares under this section 4, such determination may be challenged or disputed by the holder (or if the warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants). if the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) wishes to challenge or dispute any such fair market value determination, it (or they) shall furnish written notice to the company of its (or their) intention to challenge the same. if the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) cannot resolve the dispute between or among themselves, then such dispute shall be submitted for final determination to an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing pursuant to the valuation procedures set forth in clause (ii) under the definition of fair market value. the company shall bear any and all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) in connection with such dispute and determination, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of any investment banking, valuation or accounting firm(s) engaged by the company or the holder (or holders, as the case may be) and of attorneys in connection with such dispute and determination.

(g) other anti-dilution provisions. to the extent that levine leichtman capital partners ii, l.p. or any of its affiliates (collectively, "llcp") continues to hold this warrant, in whole or in part, at any time at which the company takes any action which would have resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price of, and the number of shares of capital stock issuable pursuant to, this warrant or conversion of the class d preferred (a "dilutive issuance"), then, to the extent that llcp has exercised all or any portion of this warrant prior to such time, the company shall immediately issue to llcp upon such dilutive issuance, without the payment of any further consideration of any kind, such number of additional shares of capital stock as shall equal the difference between (i) the number of shares of capital stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant to the extent held unexercised by llcp at such time after giving effect to the adjustment thereto resulting from such dilutive issuance and (ii) the number 17 of shares of capital stock which would have been issuable upon exercise of this warrant after giving effect to such dilutive issuance if this warrant had not been exercised in any part. 4.8 fiduciary duties of company. the company and its directors shall owe the holder the same fiduciary duties that the company and its directors would owe to the warrant shares underlying the warrant. 5. miscellaneous. 5.1 restrictive legend. this warrant, any warrant issued upon transfer of this warrant and, unless registered under the securities act, any warrant shares issued upon exercise of this warrant or any portion thereof shall be imprinted with the following legend, in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws: this warrant and the securities issuable upon exercise hereof have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or registered or qualified under any applicable state securities laws, and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned except in compliance with the registration requirements of such act and the registration or qualification requirements of such state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from such registration and qualification. the legend shall be appropriately modified upon issuance of certificates for shares of capital stock. upon request of the holder of a capital stock certificate, the company shall issue to that holder a new certificate free of the foregoing legend, if, with such request, such holder provides the company with an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the company (provided that riordan & mckinzie, a professional law corporation, shall be deemed to be acceptable to the company) to the effect that the securities evidenced by such certificate may be sold without restriction under rule 144 (or any other rule permitting resales of securities without restriction) promulgated under the securities act. 5.2 holder entitled to benefits under other agreements. the holder of this warrant (or, if the warrant has been divided up, the holders) is entitled to certain rights, benefits and privileges with respect to this warrant and the warrant shares pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement (it being understood that the 18 warrant shares constitute "registrable securities" thereunder), the investor rights agreement and certain other investment documents. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the payment and performance of the put option is secured by a lien on the collateral pursuant to the collateral documents. 5.3 other covenants. without limiting the generality of section 5.2, the company covenants and agrees that, as long as this warrant remains outstanding or any warrant shares are issuable with respect to this warrant, the company will perform all of the following covenants for the express benefit of the holder: (a) the warrant shares shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of capital stock;

limitation, expenses associated with additional investment banking firms or accountants engaged by or at the request of holders other than the representative holder). 5.10 captions; construction and interpretation. the captions in this warrant are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a part of this agreement and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this warrant. all section, preamble, recital, exhibit, schedule, disclosure schedule, annex, clause and party references are to this warrant unless otherwise stated. no party, nor its counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this warrant for purposes of construing the provisions of this warrant, and all provisions of this warrant shall be construed in accordance with their fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. 5.11 lost warrant or certificates. upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this warrant or of a stock certificate evidencing warrant shares and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the company or, in the case of any such

action, including, without limitation, amending its charter documents or regulations or through any reorganization, reclassification, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of the holder against impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company will (i) not increase the par value (if any) of any shares of capital stock receivable upon the exercise of this warrant above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of capital stock upon the exercise of this warrant, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities and claims, and (iii) use its best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the company to perform its obligations under this warrant. 5.13 governing law. in all respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, this warrant and the rights and obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the 22 state of california applicable to contracts made and performed in the state of california, without regard to principles thereof regarding conflicts of laws or choice of law, and any applicable laws of the united states of america. 5.14 remedies. if the company fails to perform, comply with or observe any covenant or agreement to be performed, complied with or observed by it under this warrant, the holder may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity or action at law, whether for specific performance of any term contained in this warrant or for an injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this warrant or to enforce any other legal or equitable right, or to take any one or more of such actions. the company hereby agrees that the holder shall not be required or otherwise obligated to, and hereby waives any right to demand that the holder, post any performance or other bond in connection with the enforcement of its rights and remedies hereunder. the company agrees to pay all fees, costs, and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts retained by the holder, and all fees, costs and expenses of appeals, incurred or expended by the holder in connection with the enforcement of this warrant or the collection of any sums due hereunder, whether or not suit is commenced. none of the rights, powers or remedies conferred under this warrant shall be mutually exclusive, and each right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right, power or remedy whether conferred by this warrant or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. 5.15 waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the company and the holder wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the company and the holder desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, and understanding they are waiving a constitutional right, the company and the holder (by acceptance hereof) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit, or proceeding brought to resolve any dispute, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising out of, connected with, related to, or incidental to, this warrant, the warrant shares, the securities purchase agreement and/or any other investment document, or the transactions completed hereby or thereby. 23 in witness whereof, the company has caused this warrant to be executed and

distribution of assets or securities, redemption of class e preferred. (a) if at any time the company issues (without payment of any consideration) to all holders of outstanding class e preferred any option rights, or any option rights to holders of outstanding common stock to which holders of class e preferred are entitled pursuant to the terms of the class e preferred, then the company shall also distribute such option rights to the holder as if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such issuance. any reduction by the company in the exercise price of any existing option rights shall be treated as a new issuance of option rights and the provisions of this section 4.2(a) shall apply. (b) if at any time the company makes a distribution to its stockholders (other than in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company) of any asset (including cash) or security or redeems the class e preferred in accordance with its terms (collectively, a "distribution") (the total of the assets or securities so distributed, the "distribution amount") other than those referred to in section 4.1 or section 4.3 or section 4.4, then, at the holder's option (provided that if the distribution is in cash, that the adjustment described in section 4.2(b)(ii) below shall not apply): 9 (i) the holder shall have the right to receive the portion of the distribution amount which a holder of the number of shares of class e preferred for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the distribution would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such distribution assuming, if the distribution is with respect to common stock, conversion of the class e preferred. upon the closing of the distribution, the company shall distribute such portion of the distribution amount to the holder; or (ii) the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted and shall be equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, multiplied by a fraction (which shall not be less than zero), the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of class e preferred on the date fixed for such determination, less the then-fair market value of the portion of the assets, or the fair market value of the portion of the securities, as the case may be, so distributed applicable to one share of class e preferred, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of class e preferred. such adjustment to the warrant purchase price shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day immediately following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. upon any adjustment to the warrant purchase price as provided for in this section 4.2(b)(ii), the number of shares of class e preferred issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall also be adjusted and shall be equal to the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. 4.3 issuance of equity securities under certain circumstances. (a) if, at any time after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell (or, in accordance with section 4.3(b), shall be deemed to have issued or sold) any shares of common stock (other than excluded securities) without consideration or for a consideration per share that is less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined as of the date of such issuance or sale, then, effective immediately upon such issuance or sale, the warrant purchase price shall be reduced (calculated to the nearest $.001 and without regard to any other provisions of this section 4) to an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately prior to such issuance or sale by (2) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale, plus (b) the cash consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale, and the denominator of which shall be the product obtained by multiplying (c) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately 10 after such sale or issuance, by (d) the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale. upon each such adjustment of the warrant purchase price hereunder, the number of warrant shares which may be obtained upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number of shares determined by multiplying (x) the number of warrant shares which could be obtained upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately after such adjustment. adjustments shall be made successively whenever such an issuance or sale is made. (b) for the purpose of determining the adjusted warrant purchase price under section 4.3(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of option rights. if the company in any manner issues or grants any option rights or convertible securities and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such option rights or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of such issuance or grant of such option rights, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such option rights (or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such option rights) shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon exercise of option rights or upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities issuable upon exercise of option rights shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuing or granting of such option rights, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such option rights, plus in the case of such option rights which relate to convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such option rights or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any manner issues or grants any convertible securities having an exercise or conversion or exchange price per share of common stock which is less than the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of issuance or sale, then the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is 11 issuable upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities is determined by dividing (a) the total amount received by the company as consideration for the issuance or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. (iii) change in equity price or conversion rate. if the purchase price provided for in any option rights, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock decreases at any time, then the warrant purchase price in effect at the time of such decrease shall be readjusted to the warrant purchase price which would have been in effect at such time had such option rights or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such decreased purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold and the number of warrant shares shall be correspondingly readjusted, by taking the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. (iv) calculation of consideration received. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, then the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. if any common stock, option rights or convertible securities are issued or sold for consideration other than cash, then the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). (v) intentionally omitted. (vi) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, option rights or convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, option rights or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such distribution or the date of the granting or such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. 12 (c) no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 4.3 with respect to the issuance of excluded shares. 4.4 reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. (a) if at any time prior to the expiration date, the company reorganizes its capital, reclassifies its capital stock, consolidates, merges or combines with or into another person (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is any change whatsoever in, or distribution with respect to, the outstanding common stock), or the company sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its property, assets or business to another person, other than in a transaction provided for in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 or 4.6, or other than the tender offer merger, and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale, transfer or other disposition of assets, (i) shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or of the company (if it is the surviving corporation) or (ii) any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or the company ("other property") are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock who are holders immediately prior to such transaction, then the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of common stock, common stock of the successor or acquiring person, and/or other property which holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such event. in such event, the aggregate warrant purchase price otherwise payable for the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be allocated among such securities and other property in proportion to the respective fair market values of such securities and other property as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.7(e). if, in connection with the tender offer merger, the company creates a new entity ("newco") and richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden exchange the capital stock held by them for equity securities of newco, the company shall not participate in the formation of newco without the express written consent of llcp in its sole discretion unless (i) this warrant is exchanged for a like warrant of newco and the capital structure of newco is identical to the capital structure of the company with respect to capital stock held by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden and llcp has the right to exchange this warrant and any shares of common stock or preferred stock it holds on the same basis as richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden, (ii) the exchange of this warrant for a like warrant of newco is tax-free to the holder, as determined by llcp in its discretion, (iii) a new warrant for common stock of newco is issued to the holder that is identical to this warrant and such warrant shall preserve the rights and privileges of this warrant and (iv) after such exchange, the number of equity securities 13 owned by the holder in relationship to the number of equity securities owned by richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden is not diminished in any way. (b) in case of any such event, the successor or acquiring person (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as the holder may approve in writing (and memorialized by resolutions of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of any shares of common stock of such successor or acquiring person for which this warrant thus becomes exercisable, which modifications shall be as equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4.4. for purposes of this section 4, "common stock of the successor or acquiring person" shall include stock or other equity securities, or securities that are exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into equity securities, of such corporation, or other securities if such person is not a corporation, of any class that is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation or person and that is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.4 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets. (c) if the number of shares of common stock held by shareholders of the company other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden is reduced within nine (9) months of the date hereof due to (i) the consummation of the tender offer or the tender offer merger; (ii) purchases by the company of its common stock pursuant to rule 10b-18 of the exchange act other than from richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; (iii) private purchases by the company of its common stock from shareholders other than richard e. schaden or richard f. schaden; or (iv) whether before or after nine (9) months from the date hereof, purchases of common stock by the company from richard f. schaden in compliance with the terms of the subordinated indebtedness set forth in sections 10.1 and 10.4 of the securities purchase agreement, and such reduced shares are retired or otherwise no longer outstanding after such merger or repurchase, the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant shall be reduced so that the number of warrant shares represent 14.0% of the class e preferred of the company on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the events described in this section 4.4(c). adjustments made pursuant to this section 4.4(c) will be reflected on an addendum to this warrant that the company will provide as provided in the next sentence. each month beginning on the date that is one month after the date hereof, and on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, the company shall deliver to the holder a statement setting forth the capital structure of the company on such date and a description of all of the events 14 requiring an adjustment or recalculation to this warrant pursuant to this section 4.4(c) and the method by which each such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, which statement shall be certified by the company's chief financial officer and chief executive officer. (d) in the event any amounts owing under the note are repaid within nine (9) months of the closing date pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, the number of warrant shares represented by this warrant shall be adjusted on the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof, by multiplying the number of warrant shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount repaid pursuant to section 4(c) of the note, and the denominator of which is 12,000,000. the resulting number shall be the adjusted number of warrant shares. 4.5 dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up. if at any time there is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up of the company, other than as contemplated by section 4.4, then the company shall cause to be mailed (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) to the holder at the holder's address as shown on the warrant register, at the earliest practicable time (and, in any event, not less than thirty (30) calendar days before any date set for definitive action) written notice of the date on which such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up shall take place, as the case may be. such notice shall also specify the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities, money or other property deliverable upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be. on such date, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender of this warrant the cash or other property, less the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, that the holder would have been entitled to receive had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding- up. upon receipt of the cash or other property, any and all rights of the holder to exercise this warrant shall terminate in their entirety. if the cash or other property distributable in the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up has a fair market value which is less than the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, this warrant shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. 4.6 other dilutive events. if any event occurs as to which the other provisions of this section 4 are not strictly applicable but as to which the failure to make any adjustment would not protect the purchase rights represented by this warrant in accordance with the intent and principles hereof, then, in each such case, the holder (or if this warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for the purchase of more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants) may demand that the company engage, and the company shall engage within fifteen (15) days of such demand, an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing which shall give its opinion as to the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the intent and principles established herein, necessary to preserve the purchase rights represented by this warrant (or such warrants). upon receipt of such opinion, the company will mail (by 15 registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a copy thereof to the holder within three (3) business days and shall make the adjustments described therein. the fees and expenses of such investment banking or accounting firm shall be borne by the company. 4.7 other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the adjustments provided for pursuant to this section 4: (a) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring such an adjustment shall occur. for the purpose of any such adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. (b) record date. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to (i) receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock or in shares of any other class or series of capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or shares of any other class or series of capital stock or (ii) subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or such other shares or securities, then all references in this section 4 to the date of the issuance or sale of such shares of capital stock or such other shares or securities shall be deemed to be references to that record date. (c) when adjustment not required. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of its capital stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights to which the provisions of section 4.1 would apply, but shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (d) notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of capital stock for which this warrant is exercisable or the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted or recalculated pursuant to this section 4, the company shall immediately, but in no event in more than two (2) business days, prepare a certificate to be executed by the chief financial officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment or recalculation and the method by which such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, specifying the number of shares of capital stock for which this warrant is exercisable and (if such adjustment was made pursuant to section 4.4) describing the number and kind of any other shares of stock or other property for which this warrant is exercisable, and any related change in the warrant purchase price, after giving effect to such adjustment, recalculation or change. the 16 company shall mail (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a signed copy of the certificate to be delivered to the holder within three (3) business days of the event which caused the adjustment or recalculation. the company shall keep at the designated office copies of all such certificates and cause them to be available for inspection at the designated office during normal business hours by the holder or any prospective transferee of this warrant designated by the holder. (e) challenge to good faith determination. whenever the board of directors of the company is required to make a determination in good faith of the fair market value of this warrant or the warrant shares under this section 4, such determination may be challenged or disputed by the holder (or if the warrant has been divided up, the holders of warrants exercisable for more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares then issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants). if the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) wishes to challenge or dispute any such fair market value determination, it (or they) shall furnish written notice to the company of its (or their) intention to challenge the same. if the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) cannot resolve the dispute between or among themselves, then such dispute shall be submitted for final determination to an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing pursuant to the valuation procedures set forth in clause (ii) under the definition of fair market value. the company shall bear any and all fees, costs and expenses incurred by the company and the holder (or such holders, as the case may be) in connection with such dispute and determination, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of any investment banking, valuation or accounting firm(s) engaged by the company or the holder (or holders, as the case may be) and of attorneys in connection with such dispute and determination. (f) independent application. except as otherwise provided herein, all subsections of this section 4 are intended to operate independently of one another (but without duplication). if an event occurs that requires the application of more than one subsection, all applicable subsections shall be given independent effect without duplication. (g) other anti-dilution provisions. to the extent that levine leichtman capital partners ii, l.p. or any of its affiliates (collectively, "llcp") continues to hold this warrant, in whole or in part, at any time at which the company takes any action which would have resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price of, and the number of shares of capital stock issuable pursuant to, this warrant or conversion of the class e preferred (a "dilutive issuance"), then, to the extent that llcp has exercised all or any portion of this warrant prior to such time, the company shall immediately issue to llcp upon such dilutive issuance, without the payment of any further consideration of any kind, such number of additional shares of capital stock as shall equal the difference between (i) the number of shares of capital stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant to the extent held unexercised by llcp at such time after giving effect to the adjustment thereto resulting from such dilutive issuance and (ii) the number 17 of shares of capital stock which would have been issuable upon exercise of this warrant after giving effect to such dilutive issuance if this warrant had not been exercised in any part. 4.8 fiduciary duties of company. the company and its directors shall owe the holder the same fiduciary duties that the company and its directors would owe to the warrant shares underlying the warrant. 5. miscellaneous. 5.1 restrictive legend. this warrant, any warrant issued upon transfer of this warrant and, unless registered under the securities act, any warrant shares issued upon exercise of this warrant or any portion thereof shall be imprinted with the following legend, in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws: this warrant and the securities issuable upon exercise hereof have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or registered or qualified under any applicable state securities laws, and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise assigned except in compliance with the registration requirements of such act and the registration or qualification requirements of such state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from such registration and qualification. the legend shall be appropriately modified upon issuance of certificates for shares of capital stock. upon request of the holder of a capital stock certificate, the company shall issue to that holder a new certificate free of the foregoing legend, if, with such request, such holder provides the company with an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the company (provided that riordan & mckinzie, a professional law corporation, shall be deemed to be acceptable to the company) to the effect that the securities evidenced by such certificate may be sold without restriction under rule 144 (or any other rule permitting resales of securities without restriction) promulgated under the securities act. 5.2 holder entitled to benefits under other agreements. the holder of this warrant (or, if the warrant has been divided up, the holders) is entitled to certain rights, benefits and privileges with respect to this warrant and the warrant shares pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement (it being understood that the 18 warrant shares constitute "registrable securities" thereunder), the investor rights agreement and certain other investment documents. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the payment and performance of the put option is secured by a lien on the collateral pursuant to the collateral documents. 5.3 other covenants. without limiting the generality of section 5.2, the company covenants and agrees that, as long as this warrant remains outstanding or any warrant shares are issuable with respect to this warrant, the company will perform all of the following covenants for the express benefit of the holder: (a) the warrant shares shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of capital stock;

the company; provided, however, that the holder may not assign or transfer all or any portion of this warrant to a competitor. each such assignment of this warrant, in whole or in part, shall be registered on the books of the company to be maintained for such purpose, upon surrender of this warrant at the designated office, together with appropriate instruments of assignment, duly completed and executed. upon such surrender, the company shall, at its own expense, within three (3) business days of surrender, execute and deliver a new warrant or warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees specified in such assignment and in the denominations specified therein and this warrant shall promptly be canceled. if any portion of this warrant is not being assigned, the company shall, at its own expense, within three (3) business days issue to the holder a new warrant evidencing the portion not so assigned. if the holder assigns this warrant to one or more persons, any decisions that the holder is entitled to make at any time hereunder shall be made by the holders holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants. this warrant shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the company, the holder and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and shall include, with respect to the company, any person succeeding the company by merger, consolidation, combination or acquisition of all or substantially all of the company's assets, and in such case, except as

exercised by the holders of warrants exercisable for more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of all of the then exercisable warrants, who will act as the representative of all holders (the "representative holder"). the representative holder will represent all holders in any meetings or negotiations related to the events giving rise to a fair market valuation or determinations under section 4.6 or section 4.7(e). the company will not be liable for expenses incurred by the holders other than 21 the representative holder (including, without limitation, expenses associated with additional investment banking firms or accountants engaged by or at the request of holders other than the representative holder). 5.10 captions; construction and interpretation. the captions in this warrant are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a part of this agreement and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this warrant. all section, preamble, recital, exhibit, schedule, disclosure schedule, annex, clause and party references are to this warrant unless otherwise stated. no party, nor its counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this warrant for purposes of construing the provisions of this warrant, and all provisions of this warrant shall be construed in accordance with their fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. 5.11 lost warrant or certificates. upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this warrant or of a stock certificate evidencing warrant shares and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this warrant or stock certificate, the company shall make and deliver to the holder, within three (3) business days of receipt by the company of such documentation, a new warrant or stock certificate, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated warrant or stock certificate. 5.12 no impairment. the company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its charter documents or regulations or through any reorganization, reclassification, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of the holder against impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company will (i) not increase the par value (if any) of any shares of capital stock receivable upon the exercise of this warrant above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of capital stock upon the exercise of this warrant, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities and claims, and (iii) use its best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the company to perform its obligations under this warrant. 5.13 governing law. in all respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, this warrant and the rights and obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the 22 state of california applicable to contracts made and performed in the state of california, without regard to principles thereof regarding conflicts of laws or choice of law, and any applicable laws of the united states of america. 5.14 remedies. if the company fails to perform, comply with or observe any covenant or agreement to be performed, complied with or observed by it under this warrant, the holder may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity or action at law, whether for specific performance of any term contained in this warrant or for an injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this warrant or to enforce any other legal or equitable right, or to take any one or more of such actions. the company hereby agrees that the holder shall not be required or otherwise obligated to, and hereby waives any right to demand that the holder, post any performance or other bond in connection with the enforcement of its rights and remedies hereunder. the company agrees to pay all fees, costs, and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts retained by the holder, and all fees, costs and expenses of appeals, incurred or expended by the holder in connection with the enforcement of this warrant or the collection of any sums due hereunder, whether or not suit is commenced. none of the rights, powers or remedies conferred under this warrant shall be mutually exclusive, and each right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right, power or remedy whether conferred by this warrant or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. 5.15 waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the company and the holder wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the company and the holder desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, and understanding they are waiving a constitutional right, the company and the holder (by acceptance hereof) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit, or proceeding brought to resolve any dispute, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising out of, connected with, related to, or incidental to, this warrant, the warrant shares, the securities purchase agreement and/or any other investment document, or the transactions completed hereby or thereby. 23 in witness whereof, the company has caused this warrant to be executed and

(e) the agreements set forth in this section 1.1 are intended to constitute enforceable voting agreements within the scope of section 7-107-302 of the colorado business corporation act. 1.2 observation rights. without limiting any of the rights of llcp in this section 1, and whether or not any llcp representative is then serving on the board, the company shall invite two (2) representatives of llcp or one (1) representative of llcp plus one (1) advisor to attend in a non-voting observer capacity all meetings of the board and the committees thereof and at all meetings of the shareholders of the company. notice of such meetings shall be given to llcp in the same manner and at the same time as to the members of the board or such committees or such shareholders, as the case may be (which in any event shall not be less then forty-eight (48) hours prior to such meeting unless otherwise agreed to by llcp in advance and in writing). llcp shall be provided with copies of (a) a meeting agenda, if any is prepared, (b) all information that is provided to the members of the board or such committees or such shareholders (whether prior to, at, or subsequent to any such meetings), as the case may be, at the same time as such materials are provided to the members of the board or such committee or such shareholders, as the case may be, and (c) copies of the minutes of all meetings of the board and such committees or such shareholders concurrently with the distribution of such minutes to one or more members of the board or such committees or such shareholders, as the case may be, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after each such meeting. 1.3 monthly operating meetings. in each calendar month after the date hereof, representatives of llcp and of the company shall meet to review the financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries as reflected in the financial information furnished pursuant to section 9.3 of the securities purchase agreement. each meeting shall at all times be comprised -3- of at least two (2) members of senior management of the company, who initially shall be richard e. schaden and john gallivan and two (2) individuals designated by llcp (who shall be representatives of levine leichtman capital partners, inc. ("llcp inc."), an affiliate of llcp). the financial officers and other members of senior management of the company shall be available at each meeting to review financial information and discuss other matters. llcp and the company shall mutually agree in each calendar month on the date and time for the meeting to be held in the immediately succeeding calendar month (provided that the failure to agree on such date and time in any month shall not be construed as an agreement not to hold a meeting in the immediately succeeding month). meetings may be conducted by telephone so long as each of the persons attending can hear each of the other persons attending the meeting. the company's financial officers shall prepare a financial package for delivery to llcp at least forty-eight hours (48) hours prior to each regularly scheduled monthly meeting. the financial package shall include, among other things, (i) the monthly reporting package and (ii) such other information regarding the company and its subsidiaries as llcp may from time to time request. the provisions of this section 1.3 shall apply on a quarterly basis instead of a monthly basis after the date on which the note has been indefeasibly paid in full or otherwise satisfied in full. 2. indemnification and insurance. 2.1 the company shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the llcp representative, llcp and the employees, partners, principals, agents, attorneys, accountants, representatives and other affiliates of llcp (including, without limitation, llcp, inc.) (collectively, the "llcp parties"), from and against all costs, expenses, liabilities, claims, judgments, damages and losses, including, without limitation, all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith, incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (collectively, "liabilities and costs"), arising out of or in any way related to the fact that any llcp party is or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the company or any subsidiary of the company, is or was serving as an observer of the board, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise and, in connection with any llcp party serving as such director, officer, employee or other agent, provided that such llcp party acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the company. 2.2 upon request by any llcp party, the company, shall advance (within five (5) business days of such request) any and all expenses, including, without limitation, any and all reasonable attorneys' fees and the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection with any matter for which such llcp party is or may be entitled to indemnification hereunder. the company shall also indemnify each llcp party from and against any and all -4- liabilities and costs incurred in connection with any claim or action brought to enforce such llcp party's rights under this section 2, or under applicable law or the company's charter or bylaws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification, or for recovery under directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the company, regardless of whether such llcp party is ultimately determined to be entitled to such indemnification or insurance recovery, as the case may be. if, for any reason, the foregoing indemnification is not available for any reason or is not sufficient to indemnify and hold the llcp parties harmless from all such liabilities and costs, then the company shall contribute to the amount of all such liabilities and costs paid or payable by any llcp party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and llcp, on the other hand, but also the relative fault of each, as well as any other equitable considerations. the company's reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations shall be in addition to any liability the company may otherwise have at law or under any other agreement, including, without limitation, the securities purchase agreement, and such obligations shall extend, upon the same terms, to all llcp parties. this section 2 shall survive indefinitely the termination of this agreement. 2.3 at any time that an llcp representative is serving on the board and continuing for as long as any claim may be made against the llcp representative during any applicable statute of limitations periods, the company shall have in place and shall maintain in force and effect one or more directors and officers liability insurance policies providing at least $10,000,000 in insurance coverage for director liability, including coverage for claims under federal and state securities laws under terms and conditions generally included in such policies and so long as the company can obtain such a policy under commercially reasonable terms (including the premium amount), provided, that if the company is unable to obtain at least $10,000,000 in insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms, it will obtain such lesser amount as is commercially reasonable. 3. co-sale agreement. 3.1 if one or more principal shareholders or any of their affiliates proposes to sell or transfer any shares of equity securities of the company now owned or held, directly or indirectly, by it or them ("co-sale shares") in any transaction (or series of related transactions) that does not constitute a public sale (as such term is defined below) or a permitted transfer (as such term is defined below), such principal shareholder or principal shareholders shall promptly notify the company and llcp in writing (the "co-sale notice") at least twenty (20) days prior to the closing of such proposed sale or transfer. the co-sale notice shall describe in reasonable detail the proposed sale or transfer, including, without limitation, the number of co-sale shares proposed to be sold or transferred, the nature of such sale or transfer, the consideration to be paid and the name and address of each prospective purchaser or transferee. in the event that the sale or transfer is being made pursuant to the provisions of section 3.8, the notice shall state under -5- which paragraph and subparagraph the sale or transfer is being made. for purposes of this agreement, (a) the term "public sale" shall mean a sale, transfer or other disposition of common stock into the public market in a broker's transaction within the meaning of section 4(4) of the securities act or in a transaction directly with a market maker as that term is defined in section 3(a)(38) of the exchange act in the manner provided for in rule 144 promulgated under the securities act or in a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act and (b) the term "permitted transfer" shall mean (i) a sale, transfer or series of sales or transfers by richard e. schaden or any of his affiliates (but this exception shall not apply to the sale, transfer or series of sales or transfers by richard e. schaden of shares held by richard f. schaden and his affiliates) of up to 15% of the equity securities of the company held by richard e. schaden or any of his affiliates on a fully diluted basis (but this exception shall not apply to shares sold on behalf of richard f. schaden and his affiliates) on the date of this agreement, resulting in gross proceeds to richard e. schaden or any of his affiliates of less than $2,000,001, (ii) a sale, transfer, or series of sales or transfers by richard f. schaden or any of his affiliates to the company in compliance with the terms of the subordinated indebtedness set forth in sections 10.1 and 10.4 of the securities purchase agreement or to richard e. schaden or any of his wholly-owned affiliates or (iii) the sale of shares by richard e. schaden pursuant to the terms of section 4 of that certain stock purchase agreement dated as of july 14, 1994 by and between richard f. schaden and richard e. schaden (the "stock purchase agreement") in effect on the date hereof or the sale of shares by richard f. schaden to richard e. schaden pursuant to the stock purchase agreement. 3.2 llcp shall have the right, exercisable upon written notice to the principal shareholder(s) within twenty-five (25) days after receipt of the co-sale notice, to participate in such sale or transfer on the same terms and conditions as specified in the co-sale notice. to the extent that llcp exercises such right of participation in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this section 3, the number of co-sale shares that the principal shareholder(s) may sell or transfer in the transaction(s) shall be correspondingly reduced. 3.3 if there shall be a decrease in the price to be paid by the proposed purchaser or transferee for the co-sale shares to be purchased from the price set forth in the co-sale notice, which decrease is acceptable to the principal shareholder(s), or any other material change in the terms or conditions set forth in the co-sale notice which are less favorable to the principal shareholder(s) but which are acceptable to the principal shareholder(s), the principal shareholder(s) shall immediately notify llcp in writing of such decrease or other change, and llcp shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice to modify the number of equity securities of the company it will sell to the purchaser or transferee, as previously indicated in the written notice delivered by llcp pursuant to section 3.2. 3.4 llcp may sell or transfer all or any portion of equity securities of the company acquired from the company equal to the product of (a) the aggregate amount of equity securities -6- of the company covered by the co-sale notice, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of common stock, warrant shares or other equity securities acquired from the company, as applicable, owned by llcp at the time of the sale or transfer (collectively, the "llcp shares"), and the denominator of which is the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and llcp shares owned by the principal shareholders in the aggregate and llcp, respectively, immediately prior to the time of the sale or transfer. in no event shall llcp be required to make any representation or warranty in connection with the sale to any prospective purchaser or transferee other than as to the organization and authority of llcp and title to the equity securities to be sold by llcp. 3.5 llcp shall effect its participation in the proposed sale or transfer by promptly delivering to the principal shareholder(s) for transfer to the prospective purchaser or transferee one or more stock certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, which represent: (a) the type and number of equity securities acquired from the company which llcp elects to sell; or (b) that number of warrant shares or other equity securities acquired from the company held by llcp which is at such time convertible into the equity securities which llcp elects to sell; provided, however, that if the prospective purchaser or transferee objects to the delivery of warrant shares or other equity securities held by llcp in lieu of common stock, llcp shall convert (if convertible in accordance with their terms) such warrant shares or other equity securities held by llcp into common stock and deliver common stock. the company agrees to make any such conversion concurrent with the actual transfer of such shares to the purchaser or transferee. 3.6 the stock certificate or certificates that llcp delivers to the principal shareholder(s) pursuant to this section 3.5 shall be transferred to the prospective purchaser or transferee in connection with the consummation of the sale of the equity securities of the company pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the co-sale notice (as such terms and conditions may be modified and accepted pursuant to section 3.3), and the principal shareholders shall concurrently therewith remit to llcp by wire transfer in immediately available funds that portion of the sale proceeds to which llcp is entitled by reason of llcp's participation in such sale. to the extent that any prospective purchaser or transferee prohibits such assignment or otherwise refuses to purchase shares or other securities from llcp, the principal shareholder(s) shall not sell to such prospective purchaser or transferee any equity securities of the company unless and until, simultaneously with such sale, the principal shareholder(s) shall purchase such shares or other securities from llcp on terms and conditions identical to those under which the principal shareholder(s) sold his or its shares (as such terms and conditions may be modified and accepted pursuant to section 3.3). subject to the foregoing sentence, if the principal shareholder(s) do not complete the proposed sale or transfer for any -7- reason, the principal shareholder(s) shall immediately, but in no event in more than two (2) business days, return to llcp all documents (including, without limitation, the warrant and all stock certificates, stock assignments and/or powers of attorney) which llcp delivered to the principal shareholder(s) pursuant to this section 3 or otherwise in connection with such sale or other transfer. 3.7 the exercise or non-exercise of the rights of llcp hereunder to participate in one or more sales of co-sale shares by the principal shareholder(s) shall not adversely affect its rights to participate in subsequent sales of co-sale shares by the principal shareholder(s). 3.8 prohibited transfers. (a) in the event of any purported or actual sale or transfer (including, without limitation, the entering into of any agreement, arrangement or understanding to sell) of co-sale shares by any principal shareholder in contravention of the co-sale rights of llcp hereunder (a "prohibited transfer"), llcp shall have, in addition to all other rights, powers or remedies available at law, in equity, under this agreement or any other investment document or under applicable law, the right to exercise the prohibited transfer put (as such term is defined below), and such principal shareholder agrees that he or it shall be bound by the applicable provisions hereof, to require the party that entered into such sale or transfer to purchase a number of shares of equity securities of the company equal to the number of shares of equity securities that llcp would have been entitled to sell under section 3.4, had the prohibited transfer been effective in accordance and in compliance with the terms of section 3.1 through section 3.6. (b) in the event of any prohibited transfer by a principal shareholder: (i) the company shall, upon the request of llcp, instruct the company's transfer agent not to enter such prohibited transfer on the stock ledger or other similar records of the company; and (ii) llcp may exercise a right (the "prohibited transfer put") to require such principal shareholder to purchase a number of shares of equity securities of the company equal to the number of shares llcp would have been entitled to sell to the purchaser under this section 3 had the prohibited transfer been effected pursuant to and in compliance with the terms hereof. such sale shall be made on the following terms and conditions: (a) the price per share at which shares are to be sold to such principal shareholder shall be equal to the price per share paid by the purchaser to such principal shareholder in the prohibited transfer. such principal shareholder shall also reimburse llcp for any and all fees and expenses, including attorneys, -8- accountants and other expenses, incurred pursuant to the exercise or attempted exercise of llcp's rights under section 3; (b) within thirty (30) days after the later of the dates on which llcp (x) received notice of the prohibited transfer or (y) otherwise became aware of the prohibited transfer, llcp shall, if exercising the prohibited transfer put, deliver to such principal shareholder the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be sold, each certificate to be properly endorsed for transfer; (c) such principal shareholder shall, immediately upon receipt of the certificate or certificates (but no later than one (1) day after receipt of such certificate or certificates) representing the shares to be sold by llcp, pay to llcp the aggregate purchase price therefor and the amount of reimbursable fees and expenses, as specified in section 3.9(b)(ii)(a), by wire transfer in immediately available funds; and (d) notwithstanding the foregoing, the company agrees that it will not effect such a transfer nor will it treat any alleged transferee as the holder of such shares without the prior written consent of llcp. 4. preemptive rights. 4.1 the company hereby grants to llcp the right to purchase up to llcp's pro rata share of any new securities (as such term is defined below) which the company may from time to time propose to sell and issue, and the company shall not issue or sell any new securities without first complying with the provisions of this section 4. for purposes of this section 4.1, llcp's pro rata share shall be equal to a percentage based on a fraction, (a) the numerator of which is equal to the number of shares of common stock held by llcp or issuable upon the exercise of the warrants (including conversion of preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants) or other equity rights of the company acquired from the company owned or held by llcp immediately prior to the issuance of the new securities, and (b) the denominator of which is equal to the sum of the total number of shares of common stock (including shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock) outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of the new securities. 4.2 the term "new securities" shall mean any capital stock (including common stock or preferred stock) of the company whether now authorized or not, and any equity rights of the company, including the issuance of any treasury stock of the company or any common stock repurchased by the company pursuant to the tender offer; provided, however, that the term new securities does not include (a) any securities issued in a public offering pursuant to an -9- effective registration statement under the securities act, so long as the company receives proceeds in such public offering (net of selling commissions and underwriting discounts) of at least $20,000,000 and so long as the securities sold in such public offering are listed on nasdaq or any other national securities exchange, (b) shares of common stock or option rights outstanding on the date hereof issued to employees of the company as part of an employee incentive plan approved by the majority of the shareholders of the company; or (c) securities issued pursuant to the stock appreciation rights plan, provided, that such securities are issued pursuant to all of the requirements in the definition of stock appreciation rights plan as set forth in section 1.1 of the securities purchase agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, the exemption described in section 4.2(b) above shall not apply to any shares issued, issuable, reserved for issuance or otherwise committed to be issued under the stock appreciation rights plan to richard e. schaden or any of his affiliates, unless (a) such issuance, reservation or other commitment meets the requirements of the definition of stock appreciation rights plan and (b) the company issues to, or otherwise offers llcp the same economic benefit/opportunity offered to richard e. schaden or any of his affiliates, including the same number and type of securities upon the same terms and conditions as those offered to richard e. schaden or any of his affiliates. 4.3 if the company proposes to undertake an issuance of new securities, it shall give llcp written notice (an "issuance notice") of its intention, describing the number and type of new securities, and their proposed offer price and the general terms upon which the company proposes to issue the same. llcp shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of the issuance notice to agree to purchase up to llcp's pro rata share of such new securities for the price and upon the terms specified in the notice by giving written notice to the company (the "acceptance notice") and indicating therein the number of new securities to be purchased. the company shall, at the closing of the issuance of the new securities, sell to llcp such number of new securities as llcp shall have agreed to purchase in the acceptance notice. 5. certain transfers. 5.1 transfers by richard f. schaden. at any time prior to june 30, 2001, richard f. schaden shall comply with the terms of section 5.7 of the securities purchase agreement. at any time after june 30, 2001, richard f. schaden may sell up to an aggregate of up to one-third (1/3) of the equity securities of the

venue. the company, each principal shareholder and llcp hereby consents and agrees that all actions, suits or other proceedings arising under or in connection with this agreement or any other investment document shall be tried and litigated in state or federal courts located in the city of los angeles, county of los angeles, state of california, which courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any and all claims, controversies and disputes arising out of this agreement or any other investment document or any other matter arising out of or related to this

of any other location where the company or any of its assets or the collateral may be found or located or to enforce any judgment or other court order in favor of llcp. the company, each principal

court, (b) waives any right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens or any objection that such person may have based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue and (c)

otherwise satisfied at such time, the rights granted to llcp under this agreement shall terminate at such time as llcp no longer owns or holds, or has the right to acquire any shares of common stock of the company, including the right to acquire from the company, directly or indirectly, at least two percent (2.0%) of the common stock on a fully diluted basis. 6.16 waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the company and the holder wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the company and the holder desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, and understanding they are waiving a constitutional right, the company and the holder (by acceptance hereof) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit, or proceeding brought to resolve any dispute, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising out of, connected with, related to, or incidental to, this warrant, the warrant shares, the securities purchase agreement and/or any other investment document, or the transactions completed hereby or thereby. -17- in witness whereof, the parties have caused this

(c) underwritten offering. if the demanding holders wish to distribute registrable securities covered by its (or their, as the case may be) request by means of an underwritten offering, it (or they, as the case may be) shall so advise the company as a part of the request made pursuant to section 2.1(a). the company shall, subject to llcp's reasonable approval, select one or more firms of investment bankers of national reputation to act as the managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with such offering and may select any additional managers to be used in connection with such offering. the right of any holder of registrable securities to include its registrable securities in such registration under section 2.1 shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. subject to section 3.1(f), all holders of registrable securities proposing to distribute their registrable securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter. (d) reduction of offering. if the managing underwriter or underwriters for a demand registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises the company and the demanding holders in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of registrable securities which the demanding holders desire to sell, taken together with all other shares of common stock or other securities which the company desires to sell and the shares of common stock, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the piggy-back registration rights, if any, which other shareholders of the company desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method or the probability of 4 success of such offering (the "maximum number of shares"), then the company shall include in such registration: (i) first, the registrable securities as to which demand registration has been requested by the demanding holders (pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of registrable securities held by each demanding holder, regardless of the number of shares of registrable securities which such demanding holder has requested be included in such registration) that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares; (ii) second, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the shares of common stock or other securities that the company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares; (iii) third, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) above, the shares of common stock for the account of other shareholders of the company that the company is obligated to register (to be allocated among the persons requesting inclusion in such registration pursuant to such agreements pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of common stock with respect to which such persons has the right to request such inclusion under such agreements, regardless of the number of shares which such person has actually requested be included in such registration) that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares; and (iv) fourth, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the shares of common stock that other shareholders desire to sell that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares. (e) withdrawal. the demanding holders or any one of them may withdraw their registrable securities from any proposed offering being effected pursuant to a demand registration by giving written notice to the company of their election to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement. if any of the demanding holders so withdraw their registrable securities from such proposed offering, the withdrawing demanding holders shall not be obligated to pay any of the expenses incurred in connection with such registration statement and no demand registration shall be deemed to have been made for purposes of section 2.1(a). 5 2.2 piggy-back registration. (a) piggy-back rights. if at any time or from time to time the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity securities, by the company for its own account or by shareholders of the company for their own account (or by the company and by shareholders of the company) (other than a registration statement relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in a company employee or non-employee director and advisor stock option plan, a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or other transaction under rule 145 of the securities act, a registration on any form for a limited purpose that does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of the registrable securities, or a registration in which the only common stock being registered is common stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being registered), the company shall (x) give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of registrable securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than thirty (30) days before the anticipated filing date (the "piggy-back notice"), which notice shall describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, of the offering; and (y) offer to the holders of registrable securities in such notice the opportunity to register such number of shares of registrable securities as such holders may request in writing within fifteen (15) days following receipt of such notice (a "piggy-back registration"). the company shall cause such registrable securities to be included in such registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit the registrable securities requested to be included in a piggy-back registration to be included on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. if the registration statement proposed to be filed by the company pursuant to this section 2.2(a) is for the company's initial public offering, llcp shall have the right to include all registrable securities then held by llcp in such public offering; provided that llcp notify the company as to the amount of registrable securities it requests registration of within twenty (20) days following receipt of the piggy-back notice. the provisions of this section 2.2 shall apply to such registration. (b) reduction of offering. if the managing underwriter or underwriters for a piggy-back registration that is to be an underwritten offering of shares for the company's account advises the company and the holders of registrable securities in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of common stock which the company desires to sell, taken together with the registrable securities as to which registration has been requested hereunder and the shares of common stock, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the piggy-back registration rights which other shareholders of the company desire to sell, exceeds the maximum number of shares, then the company shall include in such registration: 6 (i) first, the shares of common stock or other securities that the company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares; (ii) second, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i) above, the registrable securities as to which registration has been or may be requested under this section 2.2; and (iii) third, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) above, the shares of common stock, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the piggy-back registration rights which such other shareholders desire to sell that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares. (c) withdrawal. any holder of registrable securities may withdraw such holder's request for inclusion of registrable securities in any piggy-back registration by giving written notice to the company of its election to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement. the company may also elect to withdraw a registration statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement. notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the company shall pay all expenses incurred by the holders of registrable securities in connection with such piggy-back registration as provided in section 3.3. 2.3 registrations on form s-3. (a) at any time on or after the date of this agreement, after consummation of a public offering by the company pursuant to a registration statement (including, for this purpose, a registration in which the only common stock being registered is common stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being registered), if the registration of registrable securities is permitted to be made on a registration statement on form s-3 (or any similar short-form registration which may be available at such time) (a "form s-3"), the holders of registrable securities may at any time request in writing that the company register the resale of any or all of its or their registrable securities on a form s-3. upon receipt of a written request for registration of registrable securities on form s-3 (a "form s-3 notice"), the company will promptly (but not later than three (3) business days after receipt of such form s- 3 notice) furnish written notice of the proposed registration to all other holders of registrable securities, if any. the company shall cause to be filed with the commission, as soon as practicable after receipt of a form s-3 notice but not later than sixty (60) days thereafter, a form s-3 covering all of such holder's or holders' registrable securities as specified in the form s-3 notice and all of the registrable securities of any other holders who join in such request as specified in a written request given within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice from the company. in addition, the company shall use its best efforts to cause each such form s-3 to become effective as soon as practicable but not later than ninety (90) days after the date of receipt by the company of the relevant form s-3 notice. the company shall 7 use its best efforts to maintain each form s-3 continuously effective, supplemented and amended until the registrable securities covered thereby have been sold. no registration effected pursuant to this section 2.3 shall be counted as a demand registration effected pursuant to section 2.1. (b) notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration pursuant to this section 2.3 if (i) form s-3 is not available to the company for such offering; (ii) the holders of registrable securities, together with the holders of any other securities of the company entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell registrable securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the public (before deduction of any underwriters' discounts or commissions) of less than $1,000,000; (iii) the company shall furnish to the holders of registrable securities a certificate signed by the president of the company stating that, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be seriously detrimental to the company and its shareholders for such form s-3 registration to be filed at such time, in which event the company shall have the right to defer the filing of the form s-3 registration statement for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the holders of registrable securities under this section 2.3; provided, however, that the company shall not use this right more than once in any twelve (12) month period; (iv) if the company has, within the six (6) month period preceding the date of such request, already effected one such registration on form s-3 for the holders of registrable securities pursuant to this section 2.3; or (v) the company within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of such request has effected a registration of securities in which the holders of registrable securities requesting registration pursuant to this section 2.3 were entitled to participate to the fullest extent they desired pursuant to section 2.1 or 2.2. 2.4 purchase (and exercise) of the warrants by the underwriters. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to the contrary, in connection with any demand registration or piggy-back registration which is to be an underwritten offering, to the extent all or any portion of the registrable securities to be included in such registration consist of warrant shares, the holders of such registrable securities may require that the underwriter or underwriters purchase (and exercise) the warrants or any portion thereof rather than require the holders of the registrable securities to exercise the warrants or portion thereof in connection with such registration, unless the underwriters inform such holders that such a purchase and exercise of the warrants will materially and adversely affect the proposed offering. the company shall take all such action and provide all such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the holders of registrable securities to facilitate any such purchase (and exercise) of the warrants agreed to by the underwriter or underwriters, including, without limitation, issuing the warrant shares or any portion thereof to be issued within such time period as will permit the underwriters to make and complete the distribution contemplated by the underwriting; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to register the warrants pursuant to this section 2.4. 8 3. registration procedures. 3.1 filings; information. whenever the company is required to effect the registration of any registrable securities pursuant to section 2, the company shall use its best efforts to effect the registration and sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with any such request: (a) filing registration statement. the company shall, as expeditiously as possible, prepare and file with the commission, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a request for a demand registration pursuant to section 2.1, a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies or which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of all registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof, and shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the period required by section 3.1(c); provided, however, that the company shall have the right to defer such registration for up to ninety (90) days if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the president and chief executive officer of the company stating that, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be materially detrimental to the company and its shareholders for such registration statement to be effected at such time; provided further, however, that in the event the company elects to exercise such right with respect to any registration, it shall not have the right to exercise such right again prior to the date which is twelve (12) months after the date on which the registration statement relating to such deferred registration is declared effective.

and the company shall promptly, but in no event more than five (5) business days after request for payment, pay directly or reimburse each llcp indemnified party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by such llcp indemnified party in connection with investigating and defending any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or omission made in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the company, in writing, by such selling holder and stated to be specifically for use therein. the company also shall indemnify any underwriter of the registrable securities, their officers, affiliates, directors, partners, members and agents and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification provided above in this section 4.1. 4.2 indemnification by holders of registrable securities. each selling holder of registrable securities will, in the event that any registrable securities held by such selling holder as to which any registration is being effected under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, indemnify and hold harmless (severally and not jointly) the company, each of its directors and officers, attorneys and agents, and each underwriter (if any), and each other person, if any, who controls such selling holder or such underwriter within the meaning of the securities 13 act, against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which such registrable securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in the registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to the registration statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, if the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by such selling holder and stated to be specifically for use therein, and shall, within five (5) business days after a request therefor, reimburse the company, its directors and officers, attorneys and agents, and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall any holder of registrable securities be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the net proceeds actually received by such holder after taxes from the sale of registrable securities. 4.3 conduct of indemnification proceedings. promptly after receipt by any person of any written notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.1 or 4.2, such person (the "indemnified party") shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any other person for indemnification hereunder, notify such other person (the "indemnifying party") in writing of the loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have to such indemnified party hereunder, except to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure. if the indemnified party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought against the indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with all other indemnifying parties, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that in any action in which both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party are named as defendants, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel for all indemnified parties) to represent the indemnified party and its controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the indemnified party against the indemnifying party, with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by such indemnifying party if, based upon the written opinion of counsel of such indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably 14 withheld), consent to entry of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding. 4.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in the foregoing sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 is unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnified parties and the indemnifying parties in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of any indemnified party and any indemnifying party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnified party or such indemnifying party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall any holder of registrable securities be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds actually received by such holder after taxes from the sale of registrable securities which gave rise to such contribution obligation. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 5. underwriting and distribution. 5.1 rule 144. the company covenants that as long as the company is subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, it shall file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and shall take such further action as the holders of registrable securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holders to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the securities act, as such 15 rules may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. 5.2 restrictions on sale by the company and others. the company agrees that it and its affiliates (a) will not effect any sale or distribution of any securities similar to those being registered in accordance with section 2.1, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the ninety (90) days prior to, and during the one hundred eighty (180) day period commencing on, the effective date of any demand registration (except as part of such demand registration to the extent permitted by section 2.1(d)); and (b) will use reasonable best efforts to require that any agreement entered into after the date hereof pursuant to which the company issues or agrees to issue any privately placed securities shall contain a provision under which holders of such securities agree not to effect any sale or distribution of any such securities during the periods described in (a) above, in each case including a sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act (except as part of any such registration, if permitted); provided, however, that the provisions of this section 5.2 shall not prevent the conversion or exchange of any securities pursuant to their terms into or for other securities and shall not prevent the issuance of securities by the company under any employee benefit, stock option or stock subscription plans. 6. miscellaneous. 6.1 other registration rights. (a) the company hereby represents and warrants to llcp that no person has any right to require the company to register any shares of the capital stock of the company for sale or to include any shares of the capital stock of the company in any registration filed by the company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own account or for the account of any other person. (b) from and after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of llcp, (i) enter into any agreement granting any demand registration right (i.e., the right to require the company to register the sale of any shares of the company's capital stock); (ii) enter into any agreement granting any piggy-back registration right (i.e., the right to require the company to register the sale of any shares of the company's capital stock in any registration filed by the company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own account or for the account of any other person) which is inconsistent with, equal to or superior to any registration rights granted hereunder; provided, however, that the company may grant piggyback registration rights to richard e. schaden and richard f. schaden, provided, further, that such rights are no more favorable than the rights granted to llcp herein and such rights may not be exercised in the initial public offering; or (iii) enter into any agreement that adversely affects the rights granted to the holders of registrable securities hereunder. 16 6.2 successors and assigns. this agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, pursuant to the provisions of this section 6.2. the rights and obligations of llcp under this agreement shall be freely assignable in whole or in part. each such assignee, by accepting such assignment of the rights of the assignor hereunder, shall be deemed to have agreed to and be bound by the obligations of the assignor hereunder. the rights and obligations of the company hereunder may not be assigned or delegated. 6.3 notices. all notices, requests, demands and other communications which are required or

affected or impaired thereby. 6.5 counterparts. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts and by facsimile, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 6.6 descriptive headings, construction and interpretation. the descriptive headings of the several paragraphs of this agreement are for convenience of reference only and do not constitute a part of this agreement and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this agreement. all section, preamble, recital, clause and party references are to this agreement unless otherwise stated. no party, nor its counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this agreement for purposes of construing the provisions of this agreement, and all provisions of this agreement shall be construed in accordance with their fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. 6.7 waivers and amendments. neither this agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally or by course of dealing, except by a statement in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. 6.8 remedies. in the event that the company fails to observe or perform any covenant or agreement to be observed or performed under this agreement, llcp or any other holder of registrable securities may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity or action at law, whether for specific performance of any term contained in this agreement or for an injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this agreement or to enforce any other legal or equitable right, or to take any one or more of such actions. the company hereby agrees that llcp shall not be required or otherwise obligated to, and hereby waives any right to demand that llcp, post any performance or other bond in connection with the enforcement of its rights and remedies hereunder. the company agrees to pay all fees, costs, and expenses, including without limitation, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts, and all fees, costs and expenses of appeals, incurred by llcp or any other holder of registrable securities in connection with the enforcement of this agreement or the collection or any sums due hereunder, whether or not suit is commenced. none of the rights, powers or remedies conferred under this agreement shall be mutually exclusive, and each such right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right, power or remedy whether conferred by this agreement or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. 18 6.9 governing law. in all respects, including all matters of construction, validity, and performance, this agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the state of california applicable to contracts made and performed in that state (without regard to the choice of law or conflicts of law provisions thereof) and any applicable laws of the united states of america. 6.10 waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the company and llcp wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the company and llcp desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, and understanding they are waiving a constitutional right, the company and llcp (by acceptance hereof) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit, or proceeding brought to resolve any dispute, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising out of, connected with, related to, or incidental to, this agreement or the transactions completed hereby. 19 in witness whereof, the parties have caused this registration rights agreement to be executed and delivered by their duly authorized representatives as of the date
