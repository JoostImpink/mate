investment agreement &#8221;), pursuant to which the gscp investors (i) purchased (a) 531,345 shares of common stock, (b) 749,869 shares of series a-1 convertible participating non-voting perpetual preferred stock, par value us$1.00 per share, of the company (the &#8220; series a-1 preferred stock &#8221;) and (c) warrants (the &#8220; warrants &#8221;) to acquire to 340,820 shares of series a-1 preferred stock or series c non-voting common stock (as defined below), for an aggregate purchase price of $110,184,404, and (ii) subscribed to purchase additional shares of common stock and series c non-voting common stock and/or series a-1 preferred stock (collectively, the &#8220; transaction &#8221;).&#160;&#160;the funds used by the gscp investors to purchase the securities were obtained from capital contributions made by their respective partners or shareholders. &#160; the funds for shares of common stock which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the reporting persons held in client accounts with respect to which goldman sachs or another wholly owned subsidiary of gs group or their employees have investment discretion (&#8220;

&#160; 22 &#160; &#160; item 4.&#160;&#160; purpose of transaction. &#160; the gscp investors acquired the shares of common stock and series a-1 preferred stock and the warrants for investment purposes. &#160; pursuant to the investment agreement, the gscp investors agreed to acquire the following securities of the company in three tranches: (i) in the first tranche, 531,345 shares of common stock, 749,869 shares of series a-1 preferred stock and the warrants (which are exercisable for 340,820 shares of series a-1 preferred stock or, upon certain shareholder approvals, series c non-voting common stock); (ii) in the second tranche, 134,184 shares of common stock and 827,504 shares of series c non-voting common stock or, if certain shareholder approvals are not obtained, series a-1 preferred stock; and (iii) in the third tranche, 1,148,264 shares of series c non-voting common stock or, if certain shareholder approvals are not obtained, series a-1 preferred stock. &#160; the series a-1 preferred stock is a class of common share equivalents that has the economic rights pertaining to common stock (except for a $0.001 liquidation preference) but no voting rights, except on certain limited matters.&#160;&#160;shares of series a-1 preferred stock are not convertible into shares of common stock at the election of the gscp investors or their affiliates, but automatically convert into common stock upon (i) a widespread public distribution, (ii) a transfer in which no transferee (or group of associated transferees) would receive 2% or more of any class of voting securities of the company or (iii) a transfer to a transferee that would control more than 50% of the voting securities of the company without any transfer from the holder.&#160;&#160;in addition, the outstanding shares of series a-1 preferred stock automatically convert into shares of series c non-voting common stock upon the adoption of certain amendments to the company&#8217;s bye-laws, as described below. &#160; the gscp investors may elect at the second and third tranches to purchase, in lieu of certain or all of the common shares that they are entitled to purchase, shares of series a-2 convertible participating non-voting perpetual preferred stock, par value us$1.00 per share, of the company (the &#8220; series a-2 preferred stock &#8221;).&#160;&#160;the series a-2 preferred stock generally has the same rights as the series a-1 preferred stock, except that shares of series a-2 preferred stock (i) may be converted into shares of common stock at any time at the election of the holder, (ii) automatically convert into shares of common stock upon the transfer of such shares to any person that is not an affiliate of the gscp investors and (iii) automatically convert into series b non-voting common stock (as defined below) upon the adoption of certain amendments to the company&#8217;s bye-laws, as described below.&#160;&#160;the foregoing summary of the series a-1 preferred stock and series a-2 preferred stock is qualified by reference to the applicable certificate of designations, which is filed herewith as exhibit t. &#160; pursuant to the investment agreement, the company agreed to hold a shareholder vote with respect to several amendments to the company&#8217;s bye-laws.&#160;&#160;among other things, the amendments would create four sub-series of non-voting ordinary shares, par value $1.00, of the company: &#8220; series a non-voting common stock ,&#8221; &#8220; series b non-voting common stock ,&#8221; &#8220; series c non-voting common stock &#8221; and &#8220; series d non-voting common stock &#8221; (collectively, the &#8220; non-voting common stock &#8221;).&#160;&#160;each series of non-voting common stock will rank pari passu with the common stock with respect to economic rights.&#160;&#160;the currently outstanding non-voting common stock will become series a non-voting common stock and the rights attaching to such shares will remain the same.&#160;&#160;the new series b non-voting common stock will be freely convertible at the election of the holder into common stock, series c non-voting common stock or series d non-voting common stock and will automatically convert to common stock upon a transfer to any person that is not an affiliate of the gscp investors.&#160;&#160;the new series c non-voting common stock will be convertible at the election of the holder at any time only into series d non-voting common stock.&#160;&#160;the series d non-voting common stock is not convertible at the election of the holder into any other series of non-voting common stock except, following the receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals, series c non-voting common stock.&#160;&#160;shares of the series c non-voting common stock and series d non-voting common stock may be converted into shares of common stock only upon (i) a widespread public distribution, (ii) a transfer in which no transferee (or group of associated transferees) would receive 2% or more of any class of voting securities of the company or (iii) a transfer to a transferee that would control more than 50% of the voting securities of the company without any transfer from the holder.&#160;&#160;the series b and series c non-voting common stock are entitled to vote as a class on certain limited matters, such as an amendment of the bye-laws with &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; &#160; a significant and adverse effect on such series or certain mergers, consolidations or amalgamations.&#160;&#160;the amendments to the company&#8217;s bye-laws also provide for, among other things (i) adjustments to the voting cut-back mechanism with respect to united states shareholders of the company (within the meaning of applicable tax law), (ii) the primacy of the company&#8217;s indemnification obligations with respect to the director designee of gscp vi parallel, l.p. in his or her capacity as a director of the company, over any indemnification obligations of the gscp investors and (iii) the rights and obligations of the gscp investors and their affiliates with respect to corporate opportunities of the company and the gscp investors and their affiliates. &#160; the warrants are exercisable for shares of series a-1 preferred stock or, after the applicable shareholder approvals resulting in the mandatory conversion of shares of series a-1 preferred stock into shares of series c non-voting common stock, shares of series c non-voting common stock.&#160;&#160;the exercise price per share of series a-1 preferred stock or series c non-voting common stock, as applicable, is $115.00, subject to adjustment for dividends or distributions on, or subdivisions or combinations of, such underlying securities.&#160;&#160;following any consolidation, merger or amalgamation of the company, the warrants are exercisable for the consideration receivable had such warrants been exercised immediately prior to such event. &#160; the first tranche of the transaction was consummated on april 20, 2011.&#160;&#160;the second and third tranches will be consummated, assuming satisfaction or waiver of applicable closing conditions, (x) 365 days after the closing of the first tranche; (y) at such earlier date (but no earlier than december 23, 2011) as the company may designate upon 45 days&#8217; notice to the gscp investors; or (z) at such other time as the gscp investors and the company may agree.&#160;&#160;the consummation of the second and third tranches are conditional upon the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the absence of any law or court order prohibiting the consummation of the applicable tranche, the accuracy of certain fundamental representations and warranties made by the company and the gscp investors and, solely with respect to the third tranche, the approval by the company&#8217;s shareholders of the transaction.&#160;&#160;if the conditions to the consummation of the second and third tranches are satisfied or waived and the company so elects, the second and third tranches may be consummated simultaneously. &#160; the aggregate purchase price for the securities issued in the first tranche was $110,184,404.&#160;&#160;the aggregate purchase price for the securities to be issued in the second and third tranches will be determined on the basis of a per share purchase price of us$86.00, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. &#160; until the consummation of the transaction or (if earlier) the termination of the investment agreement, the gscp investors have preemptive rights, pro rata in accordance with their holdings, with respect to certain share issuances by the company, subject to customary exceptions.&#160;&#160;the company and the gscp investors also entered into a customary registration rights agreement with respect to the securities issued in the transaction. &#160; the company agreed in the investment agreement to appoint a designee of gscp vi parallel, l.p. to serve as a class i director on the board of directors of the company (the &#8220; company board &#8221;) until the current term of the company&#8217;s class i directors expires, and thereafter to include a nominee of gscp vi parallel, l.p. in the slate of directors recommended for election to class i by the company board so long as the gscp investors (together with their affiliates) hold at least 5% of the company&#8217;s then outstanding share capital.&#160;&#160;in addition, as provided in a vcoc rights letter agreement between the company and gscp vi parallel, l.p., if at any time before the gscp investors or their affiliates no longer own at least 10% of the securities purchased in the transaction a designee of gscp vi parallel, l.p. is not serving as a director on the company board, gscp vi parallel, l.p. will have the right to designate a non-voting observer to attend and participate (but not vote) at meetings of the company board and any of its committees. &#160; the company also agreed in the investment agreement to seek shareholder approval of (i) the transaction for purposes of nasdaq rule 5635 and (ii) the amendments to the company&#8217;s bye-laws described above.&#160;&#160;in connection with these shareholder votes, the company has entered into voting agreements (the &#8220; voting agreements &#8221;) with each of charles t. akre, jr.; robert j. campbell; paul j. collins; t. whit armstrong; dominic f. silvester; paul j. o&#8217;shea; nicholas a. packer; richard j. harris; akre capital management, llc; beck, mack &amp; oliver llc; r&amp;h trust co. (bvi) limited, as trustee of the right trust; r&amp;h trust co. (bvi) limited, as trustee &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; of the elbow trust; and hove investments holdings limited (the &#8220; specified shareholders &#8221;).&#160;&#160;each voting agreement provides that the specified shareholder will vote in favor of the transaction, including the proposed amendments to the company&#8217;s bye-laws. the voting agreements also provide that the specified shareholder will not, among other things, grant proxies with respect to, or encumber or transfer, the shares subject to the voting agreements, except in each case as permitted by the voting agreement.&#160;&#160;the obligations of the specified shareholders under the voting agreements terminate at the conclusion of the shareholders meeting at which the company&#8217;s shareholders vote on the transaction or, if earlier, upon the termination of the investment agreement in accordance with its terms. &#160; pursuant to the investment agreement, on april 20, 2011, the reporting persons acquired 531,345 voting shares and now beneficially own in the aggregate&#160;534,685 voting shares representing approximately 3.96% of the outstanding voting stock of the company.&#160;&#160;this beneficial ownership is less than the 5% threshold that would otherwise trigger a filing obligation under rule 13d of the act.&#160;&#160;as it may be argued by virtue of the voting agreements that the reporting persons are beneficial owners of the voting shares held by all of the specified shareholders, representing approximately 33.00% of the company&#8217;s outstanding voting shares, the reporting persons have elected to make this filing, even though they expressly disclaim (x) beneficial ownership of all of the securities held by each specified shareholder and (y) that they have formed a group with the specified shareholders for purposes of rule 13d of the act and for all other purposes. &#160; the descriptions herein of the various agreements and other documents referred to above are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements and documents, which are incorporated herein by reference. &#160; except as otherwise described herein, the reporting persons currently have no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the actions enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of the form of schedule 13d promulgated under the act.&#160;&#160;however, each reporting person reserves the right to change its plans at any time, as it deems appropriate, in light of its ongoing evaluation of (a) its business and liquidity objectives, (b) the company&#8217;s financial condition, business, operations, competitive position, prospects and/or share price, (c) industry, economic and/or securities markets conditions, (d) alternative investment opportunities, and (e) other relevant factors.&#160;&#160;without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each reporting person reserves the right (in each case, subject to any applicable restrictions under law or contract) to at any time or from time to time (i) purchase or otherwise acquire additional shares of common stock or other securities of the company, or instruments convertible into or exercisable for any such securities (collectively, &#8220; company securities &#8221;), in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, (ii) sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of company securities in public or private transactions, (iii) cause company securities to be distributed in kind to its investors, (iv) acquire or write options contracts, or enter into derivatives or hedging transactions, relating to company securities, and/or (v) advocate that the company consider or explore sales, acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, other significant corporate transactions or other changes to the company&#8217;s business, structure, organization, capitalization or dividend policy; provided, however , that the reporting persons will not, individually or collectively, take any actions that are designed to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company or otherwise exercise a controlling influence over the company absent compliance with the act, insurance regulatory and other applicable laws. &#160; item 5.&#160;&#160; interest in securities of the issuer.&#160; &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;for the purposes of rule 13d-3 promulgated under the act: &#160; (i) the reporting persons beneficially own 531,345 shares of common stock acquired on april 20, 2011 pursuant to the investment agreement, representing approximately 3.93% in the aggregate of the outstanding common stock of the company;

&#160; 25 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; representing an additional 33.00% of the outstanding common stock of the company.&#160;&#160;under this alternative scenario, the reporting persons would have beneficial ownership, between clauses (i) and (ii) of this item 5(a)-(b), of&#160;4,991,063 shares of common stock of the company representing an 36.54% of the common stock of the company in the aggregate. &#160;

(i)&#160;&#160;if at any time the company declares or pays a dividend or distribution to any holder of common shares in the form of common shares or other voting security of the company, the company shall declare and pay to each holder of non-voting convertible common shares a proportional dividend or distribution in the form of the same series of non-voting convertible common shares. (j)&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the consideration payable to gscp or its bhc affiliates as holders of non-voting convertible common shares upon a reorganization event (as defined below) consists (in whole or in part) of property or securities that would, in the sole judgment of any holder thereof, create, aggravate or exacerbate any issue, problem or concern for any such holder or any of its affiliates, then the consideration payable to such holder shall be adjusted (e.g., by the issuance of non-voting securities that are economically equivalent to the voting securities they replaced and would convert into such voting securities on transfer to an unaffiliated third party, subject, if applicable, to the conversion restrictions set forth in bye-law 4.3(e)) to the maximum extent practicable to eliminate or address such issue, problem or concern, so long as such adjusted or different securities have the same value as, and are pari passu with, the securities that they replaced. * * * 4.7(c) [ amended and restated 4.7(c) ] in the event that a tentative 9.5% u.s. shareholder exists, (i)&#160;the aggregate votes conferred by common shares held by a member and treated as controlled shares of that tentative 9.5% u.s. shareholder shall be reduced to the extent necessary such that the combined voting power conferred by the common shares and the voting power that would be conferred by the common shares into which the series b non-voting common shares are then convertible, in each case that are treated as controlled shares of the tentative 9.5% u.s. shareholder, will constitute 9.5% of the voting power of all common shares (taking into account the reduction effected by clause (ii) of this bye-law 4.7(c)) and (ii)&#160;the aggregate votes conferred by the common shares held by gscp and its affiliates and treated as controlled shares of such members shall be correspondingly reduced to the extent necessary such that the ratio of (x)&#160;the voting power represented by the sum of (a)&#160;the votes conferred by such common shares and (b)&#160;the votes that would be conferred by any common shares into which the series b non-voting &#160;
