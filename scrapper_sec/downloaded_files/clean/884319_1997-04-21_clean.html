partner of gtcr. messrs. rauner, cressey and thoma are collectively referred to herein as the "gtcr general partners" and, collectively with gtc and gtcr, are referred to herein as the "reporting persons." information with respect to each of the reporting persons is given solely by such reporting person, and no reporting person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of information given by another reporting person. by their signature on this statement, each of the reporting persons agrees that this statement is filed on behalf of such reporting person. the reporting persons may be deemed to constitute a "group" for purposes of section 13(d)(3) of the act. the reporting persons expressly disclaim that they have agreed to act as a group other than as described in this statement. gtc is engaged in the venture capital business. the address of the principal business and principal office of gtc, gtcr and each of the gtcr general partners is c/o golder, thoma, cressey, rauner, inc., 6100 sears tower, chicago, il 60606-6402. page 7 of 19 pages 8 during the past five years, none of the reporting persons has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors). during the past five years, none of the reporting persons was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activity subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. gtc is a venture capital investment fund. the 3,940,000 shares of common stock were acquired in connections with the acquisition of ero industries, inc. in july 1988, and were acquired with cash from the investment partnership. item 4. purpose of transaction. hc acquisition corp., a delaware corporation ("purchaser") and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of hedstrom corporation, a delaware corporation ("parent"), has offered to purchase all outstanding shares (the "shares") of the common stock of the issuer, at $11.25 per share (the "offer price"), net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase and in the related letter of transmittal (which, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the "offer"). the offer has been conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on june 2, 1997, or such later date which purchaser may have extended the period of time during which the offer is open (the "expiration date"), a number of shares (the "minimum number of shares") which, together with the shares subject to the stockholders agreement (as defined below), constitutes a majority of the shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis ("fully diluted basis" meaning, as of any date, the number of shares outstanding, together with shares, which the issuer may be required, now or in the future, to issue pursuant to options, warrants or other rights or obligations outstanding at that date) page 8 of 19 pages 9 on the date of purchase (the "minimum tender condition") and (ii) the debt financing sources of parent and its corporate parent, hedstrom holdings, inc., a delaware corporation ("holdings"), having provided the applicable debt financing pursuant to certain financing commitments obtained by parent and purchaser. subject to the terms of the merger agreement (as defined below), including in certain instances the issuer's consent, purchaser has reserved the right to amend or modify the terms of the offer, including, among other rights, the right, if by the expiration date any or all of the conditions of the offer are not satisfied or waived, to (i) extend the period during which the offer is open and, subject to the rights of tendering stockholders to withdraw their shares, retain all tendered shares until the expiration date, (ii) waive or reduce the minimum tender condition or waive any or all of the conditions of the offer and, subject to complying with the applicable rules and regulations of the commission, accept for payment or purchase all validly tendered shares and not extend the offer, or (iii) terminate the offer and not accept for payment any shares and return promptly all tendered shares to tendering stockholders. the offer has been made pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of april 10, 1997 (the "merger agreement"), among parent, purchaser and the issuer pursuant to which, following the consummation of the offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, purchaser will be merged with and into the issuer (the "merger"), with the issuer surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of parent. in the merger, each issued and outstanding share not tendered in the offer (excluding shares directly or indirectly owned by the issuer or by parent, purchaser or any other subsidiary of parent and shares owned by stockholders of the issuer who properly exercise dissenters' rights under delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the per share amount actually paid in the offer, in cash, without any interest thereon, less any required withholding taxes. the merger is subject to a number of other conditions, including approval by the stockholders of the issuer, if such approval is required by applicable law. in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, parent and purchaser entered into a stockholders agreement, dated as of april 10, 1997 (the "stockholders agreement"), with gtc, pursuant to which gtc has agreed to validly tender into the offer page 9 of 19 pages 10 and, except under limited circumstances, not withdraw all shares which are owned of record or beneficially by it and over which it has the legal and unconditional right to dispose of prior to the expiration date. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, gtc has agreed, and has granted to parent a proxy, to vote the shares held of record or beneficially owned by it, in favor of the merger and the actions contemplated by the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement and, among other things, against any action or agreement that (i) would result in a breach under the merger agreement or the stockholders agreement or (ii) could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the merger and the transactions contemplated by the stockholders agreement and the merger agreement. certain terms and conditions of the stockholders agreement are described below in item 6 and incorporated by reference in response to this item 4. under the delaware general corporation law, the stockholder vote necessary to approve the merger is the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares, including shares held by purchaser and its affiliates. if the minimum tender condition is met and the offer is consummated, purchaser will own a sufficient number of shares to cause the merger to be approved without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder of the issuer. if purchaser acquires at least 90% of the outstanding shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise, purchaser will be able to effect the merger pursuant to the "short-form" merger provisions of section 253 of the dgcl, without prior notice to, or any action by, any other stockholder of the issuer. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. gtc may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 3,940,000 shares of common stock and such beneficial ownership would represent approximately 38.4% of the common stock issued and outstanding at april 10, 1997. gtc has shared voting and dispositive power with gtcr and each of the gtcr general partners. gtcr is the general partner of gtc and exercises investment and voting control over securities owned by gtc. investment and voting control over securities owned by gtc is shared at gtcr by each of the gtcr general partners. thus, by virtue of the investment and voting control exercised by gtcr as general partner of gtc and shared by each of the gtcr general partners, each of the reporting persons may be deemed to beneficially own the shares. page 10 of 19 pages 11 the filing of this schedule 13d statement shall not be construed as an admission by gtc, gtcr or any of the gtcr general partners that such person is, for the purpose of section 13(d) or 13(g) of the exchange act, the beneficial owner of any securities covered by this schedule 13d statement. all such ownership percentages of the common stock reported herein are based on the representation of the issuer to gtc, gtcr and the gtcr general partners that, as of april 10, 1997, there were 10,274,300 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and reported herein to the best knowledge and belief of gtc, gtcr and the gtcr general partners. there have been no transactions in the common stock during the past 60 days which are required to be reported in this schedule 13d statement. except as reported in item 6 below and incorporated herein by reference, no person other than gtc, gtcr or the gtcr general partners has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from or the proceeds from the sale of the common stock owned beneficially by gtc, gtcr or any of the gtcr general partners, respectively. the reporting persons and certain other shareholders of the issuer are parties to a voting agreement, dated as of july 15, 1988, as amended (the "voting agreement"). the voting agreement provides that the parties thereto will vote in the same manner only with respect to the election of directors. the voting agreement does not prohibit the tender of the shares owned by gtc and will not apply to such shares following the tender and acceptance of such shares for payment by purchaser. each of the reporting persons disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock owned by the other parties to the voting agreement. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. reference is made to the information disclosed under items 2, 3 and 4 of this schedule 13d statement which is incorporated by reference in response to this item. in addition to such information, the following contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships are reported hereunder. page 11 of 19 pages 12 pursuant to the stockholders agreement, gtc has agreed to (i) validly tender (and not to withdraw) pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the offer, not later than the fifth business day after the commencement of the offer, the shares beneficially owned by it and (ii) permit parent and purchaser to publish and disclose its identity and ownership of shares and the nature of its commitments, arrangements and understandings under the stockholders agreement in the documents relating to the offer and, if stockholder approval for the merger is required, in the proxy statement relating thereto (including all documents and schedules filed with the commission). pursuant to the stockholders agreement, gtc has agreed that from the period commencing on the date of the stockholders agreement and continuing until the first to occur of the effective time, the termination of the stockholders agreement or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, at any meeting of the holders of common stock, however called, gtc shall vote (or cause to be voted) the shares held of record or beneficially owned by it (i) in favor of the merger, the execution and delivery by the issuer of the merger agreement and the approval of the terms thereof and each of the other actions contemplated by the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement and any actions required in furtherance of the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement; (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the issuer under the merger agreement or the stockholders agreement; and (iii) except as otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by parent, against the following actions (other than the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement): (a) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the issuer or its subsidiaries; (b) a sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or its subsidiaries, or a reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of the issuer or its subsidiaries; (c) (1) any change in a majority of the persons who constitute the board of directors of the issuer; (2) any change in the present capitalization of the issuer or any amendment of the issuer's certificate of incorporation or by-laws; (3) any other material change in the issuer's corporate structure or business; or (4) any other action which, in the case of each of the matters referred to in clauses c (1), (2), (3) or (4), is page 12 of 19 pages 13 intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, or materially adversely affect the merger and the transactions contemplated by the stockholders agreement and the merger agreement. gtc has further agreed not to enter into any agreement or understanding with any person or entity the effect of which would be inconsistent or violative of the provisions and agreements described above. gtc has also agreed, and the stockholders agreement includes an irrevocable proxy provision for the benefit of purchaser with respect to the shares reported herein, to vote such shares in accordance with the provisions and agreements described above. in connection with the stockholders agreement, gtc has made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including with respect to (i) its ownership of the shares and its rights and powers with respect thereto, (ii) its authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the stockholders agreement, (iii) noncontravention and enforceability, (iv) absence of conflicts, (v) the absence of liens and encumbrances on and in respect of its shares, (vi) restrictions on the transfer of its shares and the granting of proxies with respect thereto, (vii) the solicitation of acquisition proposals (as defined in the stockholders agreement), and (viii) the waiver of its appraisal rights. in addition, in the stockholders agreement, each of parent and the purchaser has made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including with respect to (i) its authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the stockholders agreement and the merger agreement, (ii) noncontravention and enforceability, (iii) absence of conflicts, and (iv) the delivery to the issuer true and complete copies of the financing commitments (as defined in the stockholders agreement). the stockholders agreement further provides that except as otherwise provided therein, the covenants and agreements contained therein with respect to the shares shall terminate upon the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms by parent or the issuer. gtc also has the absolute right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to terminate the stockholders agreement if the merger agreement is amended in any respect in a manner that is adverse to gtc or if the offer is terminated, withdrawn, abandoned, expires or is modified in any manner that is adverse to gtc. page 13 of 19 pages 14 item 7. materials to be filed as exhibits. exhibit a: stockholders agreement, dated as of

corporation need not be elected by written ballot unless the bylaws of the corporation otherwise provide. sixth: the directors of the corporation shall have the power to adopt, amend, and repeal the bylaws of the corporation. seventh: no contract or transaction between the corporation and one or more of its directors, officers, or stockholders or between the corporation and any person (as used herein "person" means other corporation, partnership, association, firm, trust, joint venture, political subdivision, or instrumentality) or other organization in which one or more of its directors, officers, or stockholders are directors, officers, or stockholders, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the board or committee which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his, her, or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (i) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors or the committee, and the board of directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (ii) the

a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, to the fullest extent permitted under the general corporation law of delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. such right shall be a

that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible. in the event of the death of any person having a right of indemnification under the foregoing provisions, such right shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives. the rights conferred above shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter

of a direct conflict between the provisions of these bylaws and the mandatory provisions of the delaware general corporation law or the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the

office of the corporation unless another place is designated for meetings in the manner provided herein. 2.4 notice. written or printed notice stating the place, day, and time of each meeting of the stockholders and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall be delivered not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting,

if such notice is to be sent by mail, it shall be directed to such stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation, unless he shall have filed with the secretary of the corporation a written request that notices to him be mailed to some other address, in which case it shall be directed to him at such other address. notice of any meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy and shall not, at the beginning of such meeting, object to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or who shall, either before or after the meeting, submit a signed waiver of notice, in person or by proxy. 2.5 voting list. at least ten days before each

and number of shares 126 registered in the name of each stockholder. for a period of ten days prior to such meeting, such list shall be kept on file at a place within the city where the meeting is to

stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, or these bylaws. if a quorum shall not be present, in person or by proxy, at any meeting of stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat who are present, in person or by proxy, or, if no stockholder entitled to vote is present, any officer of the corporation may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting (unless the board of directors, after such adjournment, fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting), until a quorum shall be present, in person or by proxy. at any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, in person or by proxy, any business may be transacted which may have been transacted at the original meeting had a quorum been present; provided that, if the adjournment is for more than 30 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting. 2.7 required vote; withdrawal of quorum. when a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of

to leave less than a quorum. 2.8 method of voting; proxies. except as otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the corporation or by law, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. elections of directors need not be by written ballot. at any meeting of stockholders, every stockholder having the right to vote may vote either in person or by a proxy executed in writing by the stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. each such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting. no proxy shall be valid after 127 three years from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. if no date is stated in a proxy, such proxy shall be presumed to have been executed on the date of the meeting at which it is to be voted. each proxy shall be revocable unless expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power or unless otherwise made irrevocable by law. 2.9 record date. (a) for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, for any such determination of stockholders, such date in any case to be not more than 60 days and not less than ten days prior to such meeting nor more than 60 days prior to any other action. if no record date is fixed: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. (iii) a determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. (b) in order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. if no record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by law or these bylaws, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered 128 to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the state of delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. delivery made to the corporation's registered office in the state of delaware, principal place of business, or such officer or agent shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. if no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by law or these bylaws, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 2.10 conduct of meeting. the chairman of the board, if such office has been filled, and, if not or if the chairman of the board is absent or otherwise unable to act, the president shall preside at all meetings of stockholders. the secretary shall keep the records of each meeting of

these bylaws or by some person appointed by the meeting. 2.11 inspectors. the board of directors may, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting or any adjournment thereof. if any of the inspectors so appointed shall fail to appear or act, the chairman of the meeting shall, or if inspectors shall not have been appointed, the chairman of the meeting may, appoint one or more inspectors. each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. the inspectors shall determine the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the validity and effect of proxies and shall receive votes, ballots, or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots, or consents, determine the results, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. on request of the chairman of the meeting, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, request, or matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any fact found by them. no director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector of an election of directors. inspectors need not be stockholders. 129 article three: directors 3.1 management. the business and property of the corporation shall be managed by the board of directors. subject to the restrictions imposed by law, the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, or these bylaws, the board of directors may exercise all the powers of the corporation. 3.2 number; qualification; election; term. the number of directors which shall constitute the entire board of directors shall be not less than one. the first board of directors shall consist of the number of directors named in the certificate of incorporation of the corporation or, if no directors are so named, shall consist of the number of directors elected by the incorporator(s) at an organizational meeting or by unanimous written consent in lieu thereof. thereafter, within the limits above specified, the number of directors which shall constitute the entire board of directors shall be determined by resolution of the board of directors or by resolution of the stockholders at

purpose, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote on the election of directors; provided, however, that so long as stockholders have the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors pursuant to the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, if less than the entire board of directors is to be removed, no one of the directors may be removed if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors. 130 3.5 vacancies. vacancies and newly-created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and each director so chosen shall hold office until the first annual meeting of stockholders held after his election and until his successor is elected and qualified or, if earlier, until his death, resignation, or removal from office. if there are no directors in office, an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. if, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly-created directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole board of directors (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the court of chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly-created directorships or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office. except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, when one or more directors shall resign from the board of directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have the power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become

waiver of notice of such meeting. 3.12 quorum; majority vote. at all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the directors fixed in the manner provided in these bylaws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. if at any meeting of the board of directors there be less than a quorum present, a majority of those present or any director solely present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. unless the act of a greater number is required by law, the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, or these bylaws, the act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is in attendance shall be the act of the board of directors. at any time that the certificate of incorporation of the corporation provides that directors elected by the holders of a class or series of stock shall have more or less than one vote per director on any matter, every reference in these bylaws to a majority or other proportion of directors shall refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes of such directors. 3.13 procedure. at meetings of the board of directors, business shall be transacted in such order as from time to time the board of directors may determine. the chairman of the board, if such office has been filled, and, if not or if the chairman of the board is absent or otherwise unable to act, the president shall preside at all meetings of the board of directors. in the absence or inability to act of either such officer, a chairman shall be chosen by the board of directors from among the directors present. the secretary of the corporation shall act as the secretary of each meeting of the board of directors unless the board of directors appoints another person to act as secretary of the meeting.

the meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent to such action with the person acting as secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward any dissent by certified 132 or registered mail to the secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. such right to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action. 3.15 compensation. the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation, including fees and reimbursement of expenses, paid to directors for attendance at regular or special meetings of the board of directors or any committee thereof; provided, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity or receiving compensation therefor. article four: committees 4.1 designation. the board of directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire board of directors, designate one or more committees. 4.2

to fill vacancies in, to change the membership of, and to discharge any committee. 4.5 alternate members of committees. the board of directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members

quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. 133 4.6 regular meetings. regular meetings of any committee may be held without notice at such time and place as may be designated from time to time by the committee and communicated to all members thereof. 4.7 special meetings. special meetings of any committee may be held whenever called by any committee member. the committee member calling any special meeting shall cause notice of such special meeting, including therein the time and place of such special meeting, to be given to each committee member at least two days before such special meeting. neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting of any committee need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of any special meeting. 4.8 quorum; majority vote. at meetings of any committee, a majority of the number of members designated by the board of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. if a quorum is not present at a meeting of any committee, a majority of the members present may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than an announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. the act of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is in attendance shall be the act of a committee, unless the act of a greater number is required by law, the certificate of incorporation of the corporation, or these bylaws. 4.9 minutes. each committee shall cause minutes of its proceedings to be prepared and shall report the same to the board of directors upon the request of the board of directors. the minutes of the proceedings of each committee shall be delivered to the secretary of the corporation for placement in the minute books of the corporation. 4.10 compensation. committee members may, by resolution of the board of directors, be allowed a fixed sum and expenses of attendance, if any, for attending any committee meetings or a stated salary. 4.11 responsibility. the designation of any committee and the delegation of authority to it shall not operate

personal notice shall not be required and any such notice may be given (a) in writing, by mail, postage prepaid, addressed to such committee member, director, or stockholder at his address as it appears on the books or (in the case of a stockholder) the stock transfer records of the corporation, or (b) by any other method permitted by law (including but not limited to overnight courier service, telegram, telex, or telefax). any notice required or permitted to be given by mail shall be deemed to be delivered and given at the time when the same is deposited in the united states mail as aforesaid. any notice required or permitted to be given by overnight courier service shall be deemed to be delivered and given at the time delivered to such service with all charges prepaid and addressed as aforesaid. any notice required or permitted to be given by telegram, telex, or telefax shall be deemed to be delivered and given at the time transmitted with all charges prepaid and

corporation, or these bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. attendance of a stockholder, director, or committee member at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such person attends for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. article six: officers 6.1 number; titles; term of office. the officers of the corporation shall be a president, a secretary, and such other officers as the board of directors may from time to time elect or appoint, including a chairman of the board, one or more vice presidents

elected and shall have qualified, until his death, or until he shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter provided. any two or more offices may be held by the same person. none of the officers need be a stockholder or a director of the corporation or a resident of the state of delaware. 135 6.2 removal. any officer or agent elected or appointed by the board of directors may be removed by the board of directors whenever in its judgment the best interest of the corporation will be served thereby, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed. election or appointment of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights. 6.3 vacancies. any vacancy occurring in any office of the corporation (by death, resignation, removal, or otherwise) may be filled by the board of directors. 6.4 authority. officers shall have such authority and perform such duties in the management of the corporation as are provided in these bylaws or as may be determined by resolution of the board of directors not inconsistent with these bylaws. 6.5 compensation. the compensation, if any, of officers and agents shall be

reasonably incident to such responsibilities. if the board of directors has not elected a chairman of the board or in the absence or inability to act of the chairman of the board, the president shall exercise all of the powers and discharge all of the duties of the chairman of the board. as between the corporation and third parties, any action taken by the president in the performance of the

president shall have such powers and duties as may be assigned to him by the board of directors, the chairman of the board, or the president, and (in order of their seniority as determined by the board of directors or, in the absence of such determination, as determined by the length of time they have held the office of vice president) shall exercise the powers of the president during that officer's absence or inability to act. as 136 between the corporation and third parties, any action taken by a vice president in the performance of the duties of the president shall be conclusive evidence of the absence or inability to act of the president at the time such action was taken. 6.9 treasurer. the treasurer shall have custody of the corporation's funds and securities, shall keep full and accurate account of receipts and disbursements, shall deposit all monies and valuable effects in the name and to the credit of the corporation in such depository or depositories as may be
