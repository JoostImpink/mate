(e) expenses. all expenses incurred in connection with the first registration pursuant to this section 2.2, including without limitation all registration and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, (but excluding underwriters' discounts and commissions relating to shares sold by the holders), shall be borne by the company. each holder participating in a registration pursuant to this section 2.2 shall bear such holder's proportionate share (based on the total number of shares sold in such registration other than for the account of the company) of all discounts, commissions or other amounts payable to underwriters or brokers in connection with such offering. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to this section 2.2 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be registered, unless the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding agree that such registration constitutes the use by the holders of one (1) demand registration pursuant to this section 2.2 (in which case such registration shall also constitute the use by all holders of registrable securities of one (1) such demand registration); provided, further, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of the company not known to the holders at the time of their request for such registration and have withdrawn their request for registration with reasonable promptness after learning of such material adverse change, then the holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to this section 2.2. the company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration pursuant to this section 2.2 after the company has paid for one registration pursuant to this section 2.2 (excluding any registration that is withdrawn after learning of such a material adverse change). 2.3 piggyback registrations. the company shall notify all holders of registrable securities in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to filing any registration statement under the securities act for purposes of effecting a public offering of securities of the company (including, but not limited to, registration statements relating to secondary offerings of securities of the company, but excluding registration statements relating to any registration under section 2.2 or section 2.4 of this agreement or to any employee benefit plan or a corporate reorganization) and will afford each such holder an opportunity to include in such registration statement all or any part of the registrable securities then held by such holder. each holder desiring to include in any such registration statement all or any part of the registrable securities held by such holder shall, within twenty (20) 6 schedule 13d page 34 of __ days after receipt of the above-described notice from the company, so notify the company in writing, and in such notice shall inform the company of the number of registrable securities such holder wishes to include in such registration statement. if a holder decides not to include all of its registrable securities in any registration statement thereafter filed by the company, such holder shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include any registrable securities in any subsequent registration statement or registration statements as may be filed by the company with respect to offerings of its securities, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. (a) underwriting. if a registration statement under which the company gives notice under this section 2.3 is for an underwritten offering, then the company shall so advise the holders of registrable securities. in such event, the right of any such holder's registrable securities to be included in a registration pursuant to this section 2.3 shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. all holders proposing to distribute their registrable securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting (including a market stand-off agreement of up to 180 days if required by such underwriters). notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if the managing underwriter determine(s) in good faith that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then the managing underwriter(s) may exclude shares (including registrable securities) from the registration and the underwriting, and the number of shares that may be included in the registration and the underwriting shall be allocated, first, to the company, and second, to each of the holders requesting inclusion of their registrable securities in such registration statement on a pro rata basis based on the total number of registrable securities then held by each such holder provided, however, that the right of the underwriters to exclude shares (including registrable securities) from the registration and underwriting as described above shall be restricted so that (i) the number of registrable securities included in any such registration is not reduced below fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate number of shares covered by the registration; and (ii) all shares that are not registrable securities and are held by any other person, including, without limitation, any person who is an employee, officer or director of the company (or any subsidiary of the company) shall first be excluded from such registration and underwriting before any registrable securities are so excluded. if any holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the underwriter, delivered at least ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of the registration statement. any registrable securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration. for any holder which is a partnership or corporation, the partners, retired partners and shareholders of such holder, or the estates and family members of any such partners and retired partners and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing persons shall be deemed to be a single "holder", and any pro rata reduction with respect to such "holder" shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all entities and individuals included in such "holder," as defined in this sentence. 7 schedule 13d page 35 of __ (b) expenses. all expenses incurred in connection with a registration pursuant to this section 2.3 (excluding underwriters' and brokers' discounts and commissions relating to shares sold by the holders), including, without limitation all federal and "blue sky" registration and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company shall be borne by the company. 2.4 form s-3 registration. in case the company shall receive from any holder or holders of a majority of all registrable securities then outstanding a written request or requests that the company effect a registration on form s-3 and any related qualification or compliance with respect to all or a part of the registrable securities owned by such holder or holders, then the company will: (a) notice. promptly give written notice of the proposed registration and the holder's or holders' request therefor, and any related qualification or compliance, to all other holders of registrable securities; and (b) registration. as soon as practicable, effect such registration and all such qualifications and compliances as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such holder's or holders' registrable securities as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the registrable securities of any other holder or holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within twenty (20) days after the company provides the notice contemplated by section 2.4(a); provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this section 2.4: (1) if form s-3 is not available for such offering by the holders; (2) if the holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the company entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell registrable securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the public of less than $2,000,000; (3) if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the president or chief executive officer of the company stating that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be materially detrimental to the company and its shareholders for such form s-3 registration to be effected at such time, in which 8 schedule 13d page 36 of __ event the company shall have the right to defer the filing of the form s-3 registration statement no more than once during any twelve month period for a period of not more than 60 days after receipt of the request of the holder or holders under this section 2.4;

(g) opinion and comfort letter. furnish, at the request of any holder requesting registration of registrable securities, on the date that such registrable securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, or, if such securities are not being sold through underwriters, on the date that the registration statement with respect to such securities becomes effective, (i) an opinion, dated as of such date, of the counsel representing the company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering and reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of the holders requesting registration, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the holders requesting registration of registrable securities and (ii) a "comfort" letter dated as of such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the 10 schedule 13d page 38 of __ company, in form and substance aarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering and reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of the holders requesting registration, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the holders requesting registration of registrable securities. 2.6 furnish information. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to sections 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 that the selling holders shall furnish to the company such information regarding themselves, the registrable securities held by them, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to timely effect the registration of their registrable securities. 2.7 indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under sections 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4: (a) by the company. to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder, the partners, officers and directors of each holder, any underwriter (as defined in the securities act) for such holder and each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, (the "1934 act"), against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the securities act, the l934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the securities act, the 1934 act, any federal or state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the 1934 act or any federal or 11 schedule 13d page 39 of __ state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and the company will reimburse each such holder, partner, officer or director, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them, as incurred, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 2.7(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by such holder, partner, officer, director, underwriter or controlling person of such holder. (b) by selling holders. to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter and any other holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other holder's partners, directors or officers or any person who controls such holder within the meaning of the securities act or the 1934 act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other such holder, partner or director, officer or controlling person of such other holder may become subject under the securities act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other holder, partner, officer, director or controlling person of such other holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 2.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided further, that the total amounts payable in indemnity by a holder under this section 2.7(b) in respect of any violation shall not exceed the net proceeds received by such holder in the registered offering out of which such violation arises. (c) notice. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 2.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 2.7, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement 12 schedule 13d page 40 of __ thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflict of interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying party of liability to the indemnified party under this section 2.7 to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result thereof, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 2.7. (d) defect eliminated in final prospectus. the foregoing indemnity agreements of the company and holders are subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any violation made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the sec at the time the registration statement in question becomes effective or the amended prospectus filed with the sec pursuant to sec rule 424(b) (the "final prospectus), such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any person if a copy of the final prospectus was timely furnished to the indemnified party and was not furnished to the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such action is required by the securities act. (e) contribution. in order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the securities act in any case in which either (i) any holder exercising rights under this agreement, or any controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this section 2.7 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this section 2.7 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the securities act may be required on the part of any such selling holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this section 2.7; then, and in each such case, the company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that such holder is responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of its registrable securities offered by and sold under the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by and sold under such registration statement, and the company and other selling holders are responsible for the remaining portion; provided, however, that, in any such case, (a) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such registrable securities offered and sold by such holder pursuant to such registration statement; and (b) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 13 schedule 13d page 41 of __ (f) survival. the obligations of the company and holders under this section 2.7 shall survive until the fifth anniversary of the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement, regardless of the expiration of any statutes of limitation or extensions of such statutes. 2.8 termination of the company's obligations. the company shall have no obligations pursuant to sections 2.2 through 2.4 with respect to any registrable securities proposed to be sold by a holder in a registration pursuant to section 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 more than seven (7) years after the date of this agreement, or, if, in the opinion of counsel to the company, all such registrable securities proposed to be sold by a holder may then be sold under rule 144 in one transaction without exceeding the volume limitations thereunder. 3. right of participation. 3.1 general. the investor and any majority owned subsidiary of the investor to which rights under this section 3 have been duly assigned in accordance with section 8.1 (the investor and each such assignee being hereinafter referred to as a "participation rights holder") has the right of first refusal to purchase such participation rights holder's pro rata share (as defined below), of all (or any part) of any new securities (as defined in section 3.3) that the company may from time to time issue after the date of this agreement (the "right of participation"); provided, however, that no participation rights holder shall have the right of participation with respect to any issuance of new securities that would result in less than a ten percent (10%) reduction in such participation rights holder's pro rata share. 3.2 pro rata share. a participation rights holder's "pro rata share" for purposes of the right of participation is the ratio of (a) the number of registrable securities held by such participation rights holder, to (b) the difference between (i) the total number of shares of common stock of the company (and other voting securities of the company, if any) then outstanding (immediately prior to the issuance of new securities giving rise to the right of participation), and (ii) the number of dilutive securities (defined below) issued since the last notice date (defined below) excluding any maintenance securities (defined below) issued pursuant to the last maintenance notice. 3.3 new securities. "new securities" shall mean any common stock, preferred stock or other voting capital stock of the company, whether now authorized or not, and rights, options or warrants to purchase such common stock or preferred stock, and securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become, convertible or exchangeable into such common stock, 14 schedule 13d page 42 of __ preferred stock or other capital stock; provided, however, that the term "new securities" does not include: (a) any shares of the company's common stock (and/or options or warrants therefor) issued to employees, officers, directors, contractors, advisors or consultants of the company pursuant to incentive agreements or incentive plans approved by the board of directors of the company; (b) any shares of common stock issued under the purchase agreement, as such agreement may be amended; (c) the warrant or any shares of common stock issued upon any exercise thereof; (d) any securities issued in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or other similar event in which all participation rights holders are entitled to participate on a pro rata basis;

(a) employee stock. to the extent that the right to purchase maintenance securities arises out of the issuance of dilutive securities to employees, officers, directors, contractors, advisors or consultants of the company pursuant to incentive agreements or incentive plans approved by the board of directors of the company ("employee stock"), the per share 17 schedule 13d page 45 of --- "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the average market price (as defined below) of such maintenance securities over the thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the date on which the participation rights holder elects to purchase such maintenance securities. (b) other dilutive securities. to the extent that the right to purchase maintenance securities arises out of any issuance of dilutive securities other than employee stock, the per share "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the greater of (i) the per share price at which such dilutive securities were issued, and (ii) 75% of the average of the market price (as defined below) of such maintenance securities over the thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the date on which the participation rights holder elects to purchase such maintenance securities, unless the issuance of such other dilutive securities occurred upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of other securities ("exchangeable securities"), in which case, the per share "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the greater of (i) the sum of (a) the per share amount paid upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, and (b) the per share amount previously paid for the exchangeable securities (adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends or other similar events), and (ii) 75% of the average market price of such maintenance securities over the thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the date on which the participation rights holder elects to purchase such maintenance securities. (c) market price. for purposes of this section 4.3, "market price" means as to any maintenance securities on a given day the average of the closing prices of such security's sales on all domestic securities exchanges on which such security may at the time be listed, or, if there have been no sales on any such exchange on such day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on all such exchanges at the end of such day, or, if on any day such security is not so listed, the average of the representative bid and asked prices quoted in the nasdaq national market as of 4:00 p.m., new york time, on such day, or, if on any day such security is not quoted in the nasdaq national market, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on such day in the domestic over-the-counter market as reported by the national quotation bureau, incorporated, or any similar successor organization. if at any time the maintenance securities are not listed on any domestic securities exchange or quoted in the nasdaq national market or the domestic over-the-counter market ("unlisted securities"), the "market price" shall be the fair value thereof determined jointly by the company and the holder. (d) consideration other than cash. in the event that dilutive securities or exchangeable securities were issued for consideration other than cash, the per share amounts paid for such dilutive securities or exchangeable securities shall be determined jointly by the company and the participation rights holder. (e) appraiser. if the company and the participation rights holder are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time with respect to (i) the market price 18 schedule 13d page 46 of ---

the case may be, shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the company and the participation rights holder. the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding on the company and the participation rights holder. the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be paid for by the company, provided that such fees and expenses shall be paid for by the participation rights holder

purchase price for the company or the assets, as the case may be, that is less than 90% of the proposed selling price, but which is on terms and conditions that are substantially the same as those

assets, as the case may be, at the purchase price specified in the lower price notice and on substantially the same terms and conditions specified in the solicitation notice or the lower price notice, which agreement shall call for the closing of such purchase within 120 days from the date of delivery of such notice to the company (such 120 day period subject to extensions for regulatory compliance). if the investor fails to so agree in writing within such five (5) business day period, then, for a period of 120 days thereafter, the company shall have the right to accept any offer substantially on the same terms and conditions as those described in the solicitation notice, provided that the selling price for the company or the assets, as the case may be, is equal to or greater than the purchase price specified in the lower price notice. 5.4 unsolicited offers for corporate event. if the company receives an unsolicited offer from a third party for a proposed corporate event

is equal to or greater than 115% of the offered purchase price (an "investor offer"). the company agrees that it will not unreasonably refuse a request by the investor to extend any such seven (7) business day period by up to three (3) additional business days. if the investor fails to make an investor offer in writing within such seven (7) business day period (subject to the above mentioned extension), then, for a period of 90 days thereafter, the company shall have the right to enter into a binding agreement with such third party on substantially the same terms and conditions as the offered event which calls for the completion of the corporate event within six (6) months of the date of such agreement (subject to extensions for regulatory compliance), provided that the purchase price for the company or the assets, as the case may be, is equal to or greater than the offered purchase price. if the investor makes an investor offer in writing within such seven (7) business day period (subject to the above mentioned extension), then, the company agrees that it will not solicit further proposals for a corporate event (unless and until the corporate event represented by such investor offer is abandoned), that it will accept such investor 22 schedule 13d page 50 of --- offer, and that it will recommend that the company's stockholders approve acceptance of the investor

company's stockholders under applicable law; provided, however, that in the event that the company takes an action pursuant to this section 5.6 that is otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the remainder of this section 5, and such action involves the solicitation of, or the proposal by the company to accept, an offer for a proposed corporate event, the parties agree, notwithstanding any other provision herein, that such proposed corporate event will be treated as an offered event pursuant to the terms of section 5.4. 5.7 termination and suspension of rights. the rights of the
