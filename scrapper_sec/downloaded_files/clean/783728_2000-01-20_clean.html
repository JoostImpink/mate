delaware, c.a. no. 14267, william n. strassburger v. michael m. early, -------------------------------------------- luther a. henderson, john c. stiska, n. russell walden, triton group, ltd. and - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ridgewood properties, inc. (the "litigation"). no representations have been - -------------------------- made by either party to the other party regarding the outcome of the litigation. 5.1.2 if rescission is ordered. ------------------------ if the court grants plaintiff's request for rescission of the 1994 stock repurchase at issue in the litigation, this section shall apply. "rescission" for purposes of this agreement means a transaction whereby the company is entitled to receive shares, either alone or with cash (other than damages, which cash payments are addressed in section 5.1.3) from the shareholder, whether or not the shareholder is also entitled to receive shares of common stock of the company, par value $0.01 per share ("common stock") from the company. -6- when rescission is required. when the court requires that the rescission must - --------------------------- be completed, the purchaser agrees to return to the shareholder, and the shareholder agrees to accept from the purchaser, upon the shareholder's completion of such rescission, the shares, and the shareholder agrees to return to the purchaser the purchase price set forth in section 2.1 ($1,650,000). if the purchaser has converted all or part of the shares into common stock, all such shares of common stock will be included in such return to the shareholder without adjustment to the purchase price being returned as set forth in the previous sentence. simultaneously with the completion of the rescission, the purchaser agrees to purchase from the shareholder all of the shares of common stock received by the shareholder from the company in the rescission (if any). for these shares, the purchaser shall pay an aggregate purchase price in cash equal to (1) $1,650,000, plus (2) an amount equal to fifty percent of the product of (x) the amount paid by the shareholder to the company in the rescission minus any amount that the company is required to pay pursuant to the court's order to reimburse the plaintiffs for attorneys fees and expenses, multiplied by (y) the purchaser's ownership fraction after the completion of such purchase. if no court order addressing the reimbursement of plaintiffs' attorneys fees and expenses has been issued prior to making the above payment, then the above payment shall be made at the time of the rescission without deducting any amount for such fees and expenses. if the court subsequently issues an order requiring the company to pay any portion of plaintiffs' attorneys fees and expenses, then the shareholder shall refund to the purchaser a portion of the amount paid pursuant to item (2) above reflecting the calculation of such payment adjusted for such subsequent order. the "ownership fraction" equals (1) the total number of shares of common stock that the person in question owns or has the right to acquire, whether by exercise of options or other rights, or conversion of securities, divided by (2) the total number of outstanding shares of common stock, including shares that may be issued upon exercise of options or other rights, or conversion of securities. pending appeal, if any. if a rescission is ordered, then if the shareholder - ---------------------- elects to appeal such order, shareholder agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such rescission order to be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. pending such appeal, if the court orders -7- that something must be done with the shares, then, solely to the extent that the shareholder is unable to comply with such order as a result of having transferred the shares to purchaser pursuant to this agreement, the purchaser agrees to, at its option, either (1) take all actions with respect to the shares necessary to place the shareholder in a position to comply with such order or (2) if such order need not be complied with if the shareholder posts a bond, not take the actions described in (1) and reimburse the shareholder for the cost of the bond. 5.1.3 if damages are ordered. ---------------------- if as a result of the litigation the court orders that the shareholder, triton management group or any of their respective affiliates (the "shareholder parties") must pay damages to the company, this section shall apply. this section shall apply whether or not the court also orders rescission. when payment of damages is required. if the court requires that damages must be - ----------------------------------- paid (in addition to any cash payment in connection with a rescission), then as consideration for its purchase of the shares, upon the payment of any required damages by any of the shareholder parties (but, if such shareholder parties elect to appeal, only after the court's entry of a final non-appealable order, and if no appeal is elected, only after the expiration of time after which no appeal can be taken), the purchaser shall pay an amount to the shareholder equal to fifty percent of (x) such damages minus any amount that the company is required to pay pursuant to the court's order to reimburse the plaintiffs for attorneys fees and expenses, multiplied by (y) the purchaser's ownership fraction as of the date on which the damages are paid. if no court order addressing the reimbursement of plaintiffs' attorneys fees and expenses has been issued prior to making the above payment, then the above payment shall be made without deducting any amount for such fees and expenses. if the court subsequently issues an order requiring the company to pay any portion of plaintiffs' attorneys fees and expenses, then the shareholder shall refund to the purchaser a portion of the amount paid pursuant to item (2) above reflecting the calculation of such payment adjusted for such subsequent order. if the court requires payment of the damages while an appeal is pending and such payment can be avoided by shareholder posting a bond, then the purchaser agrees, if it requests the shareholder to post a bond in lieu of payment of the damages while the appeal is pending, to reimburse the shareholder for the cost of posting the bond. -8- pending appeal, if any. if the shareholder elects to appeal the damages order, - ---------------------- shareholder agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such damages order to be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. if in connection with the appeal of a damages order, the court orders that something must be done with the shares, then, solely to the extent that the shareholder is unable to comply with such order as a result of having transferred the shares to purchaser pursuant to this agreement, the purchaser agrees to, at its option, either (1) take all actions with respect to the shares necessary to place the shareholder in a position to comply with such order or (2) if such order need not be complied with if the shareholder posts a bond, not take the actions described in (1) and reimburse the shareholder for the cost of the bond. no force or effect under certain circumstances. this section 5.1.3 shall be of - ---------------------------------------------- no force or effect if the court orders rescission and, as part of such order, shareholder is not entitled to receive shares of common stock from the company. 5.1.4 if appeal is successful. ----------------------- if the shareholder is successful on appeal, the parties agree to take all reasonable steps to undo any actions taken under sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3, so that each party is in the position it was in prior to the taking of such actions. if the shareholder is successful in part on appeal, the parties shall at that time discuss how best to take such reasonable steps as can be taken to put each party in as similar a position as possible as it was prior to the taking of such actions under sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3. 5.2 agreement regarding dividends. ----------------------------- notwithstanding the performance by shareholder and purchaser in accordance herewith, purchaser shall retain any and all rights to, and interests in, any dividends accrued, paid or payable with respect to the shares prior to the date of such performance by the parties. 5.3 agreement regarding fees of counsel to the shareholder. ------------------------------------------------------ the purchaser agrees to cause the company to continue its arrangement with the shareholder whereby the company will pay two-thirds of the fees and expenses of potter anderson & corroon in connection with the litigation and the shareholder will pay one-third of such fees and expenses. -9- article 6. closing date, conditions and transactions. ----------------------------------------- 6.1 closing date and place.

assigns (the purchaser and such persons are collectively hereinafter referred to as the "purchaser's indemnified persons"), harmless from and against any and all loss, liability, damage or deficiency (including interest, penalties, costs of preparation and investigation, and reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively, "losses") that the purchaser's indemnified persons may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to arising out of or due to: (a) any inaccuracy of any representation of the shareholder in this agreement, any schedule or exhibit hereto or any certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto; (b) the breach of any warranty of the shareholder in this agreement, any schedule or exhibit hereto or any certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) the nonfulfillment of any covenant, undertaking, agreement or other obligation of the shareholder under this agreement, any schedule or exhibit hereto or any certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto, not otherwise waived by the purchaser. 7.2 indemnification by the purchaser. -------------------------------- subject to the limits set forth in this article 7, the purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the shareholder and the shareholder's successors and assigns (the shareholder and such persons are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "shareholder's indemnified persons"), harmless from and against any and all losses that the shareholder's indemnified persons may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to arising out of or due to: (a) any inaccuracy of any representation of the purchaser in this agreement, any schedule or exhibit hereto, or any -10- certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto; (b) the breach of any warranty of the purchaser in this agreement, any schedule or exhibit hereto, or any certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) the nonfulfillment of any covenant, undertaking, agreement or other obligation of the purchaser under this agreement, any schedule or exhibit hereto, or any certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto not otherwise waived by the shareholder. 7.3 survival of representations and warranties; threshold. ----------------------------------------------------- except for the representation and warranty of shareholder in section 3.1.4, which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the several representations and warranties of the parties contained in this agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and the parties' right to indemnity in accordance with this article 7 for breaches of such representations and warranties shall survive the closing date and shall remain in full force and effect thereafter for a period of 18 months after the closing date and shall be effective with respect to any inaccuracy therein or breach thereof, notice of which shall have been duly given within such 18-month period in accordance with section 7.4 hereof, after which 18-month period they shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither party shall be entitled to any recovery from the other party with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of such representations or warranties unless and until the amount of such losses suffered, sustained or incurred by the asserting party, or to which such party becomes subject, by reason of such inaccuracy or breach, shall exceed $50,000 calculated on a cumulative basis and not a per item basis (the "basket amount"), but in no event shall the shareholder or the purchaser be liable to the other, in each case, for breaches of representations and warranties in an aggregate amount in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the purchase price (the "cap"), except with respect to any breach by shareholder of the representation and warranty made in section 3.1.4, as to which the cap shall equal $1,650,000. the covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this agreement shall survive according to their respective terms and breaches thereof shall not be subject to the cap or the basket amount. 7.4 notice and opportunity to defend. -------------------------------- if there occurs an event which either party asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to sections 7.1 or 7.2 hereof, the party seeking indemnification (the "indemnitee") shall notify the -11- party obligated to provide indemnification (the "indemnitor") promptly. if such event involves (a) any claim, or (b) the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third person, the indemnitee shall give the indemnitor written notice of such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding. delay or failure to so notify the indemnitor shall only relieve the indemnitor of its obligations to the extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by reasons of such delay or failure. the indemnitor shall have a period of 30 days within which to respond to the indemnitee's notice, which response will be in writing. if the indemnitor accepts responsibility, then the indemnitor shall be obligated to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by counsel chosen by the indemnitor and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnitee, such matter, and the indemnitor shall provide the indemnitee with such assurances as may be reasonably required by the indemnitee to assure that the indemnitor will assume and be responsible for the entire liability at issue, subject to the limitations set forth in section 7.5 hereof. if the indemnitor does not respond within such 30-day period or rejects responsibility for such matter in whole or in part, the indemnitee shall be free to pursue, without prejudice to any of its rights hereunder, such remedies as may be available to the indemnitee under applicable law. the indemnitee agrees to cooperate fully with the indemnitor and its counsel in the defense against any such asserted liability. in any event, the indemnitee shall have the right to participate at its own expense in the defense of such asserted liability. any compromise of such asserted liability by the indemnitor shall require the prior written consent of the indemnitee and until such consent is obtained the indemnitor shall continue the defense of such asserted liability. in addition, any compromise of such asserted liability shall include as an unconditional term thereof the giving of a complete release from liability with respect to such action or claim to the indemnitee. 7.5 reduction for insurance. ----------------------- the amount which an indemnitor is required to pay to, for, or on behalf of an indemnitee pursuant to this article 7 shall be reduced (including, without limitation, retroactively) by any insurance proceeds actually recovered by or on behalf of the indemnitee in reduction of the related indemnifiable loss (the "indemnifiable loss"). amounts required to be paid, as so reduced, are hereinafter sometimes called an "indemnity payment." if an indemnitee shall have received, or if an indemnitor shall have paid on its behalf, an indemnity payment in respect of an indemnifiable loss and shall subsequently receive, directly or indirectly, insurance proceeds in -12- respect of such indemnifiable loss, then such indemnitee shall promptly pay to the indemnitor the amount of such insurance proceeds, or, if less, the amount of the indemnity payment. the parties hereto agree that the foregoing shall not affect the subrogation rights of any insurance companies making payments hereunder. article 8. miscellaneous. ------------- 8.1 expenses. -------- except as otherwise set forth in this agreement, each of the parties hereto
