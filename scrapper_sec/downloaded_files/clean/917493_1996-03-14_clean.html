("wec"), lelia carroll ("lc") and holden investment l.l.c., an illinois limited liability company ("holden"), as of february 29, 1996. recitals a. crl, certain members of the family of wallace e. carroll and various trusts and other entities established by them offered to purchase all of the publicly-held shares of the common stock of katy industries, inc. ("katy") in 1993. b. in december 1993, the board of directors of crl (the "board") deemed it to be in the best interest of crl to obtain additional shares of katy through open market purchases. c. the board was advised that due to regulatory considerations, crl should not at that time purchase the additional shares. d. the board determined that the economic interest of crl in the shares of katy stock held by crl would be maximized through the purchase of additional shares of katy stock by wec and lc. e. to induce wec and lc to make such purchases of additional shares of katy stock, crl guaranteed wec and lc that they would not suffer financial loss in connection with such purchases. crl did not require as a condition to such guarantee that any profits realized from the proposed purchases be returned to crl. f. as an additional inducement to make the purchases described above, crl agreed to loan and did loan to wec and lc funds necessary to make such purchases. g. in consideration of these guarantees and loans from crl, wec and lc agreed to purchase and did each purchase 118,900 shares, respectively, of katy stock in december 1993. h. as of the date hereof, crl and other entities owned by members of the family of wallace e. carroll and trusts for their benefit are being reorganized (the "reorganization"). i. pursuant to the reorganization, the shareholders of crl are receiving distributions from crl and assuming certain liabilities of crl equal to their proportionate share of the net asset value of crl (with wec and his family trusts retaining their proportionate share through ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of crl after giving effect to the reorganization). j. pursuant to the reorganization, crl is also contributing to holden certain of the assets and liabilities of crl in exchange for which crl will receive membership interests in holden which will thereafter be distributed to crl shareholders in accordance with recital i above. k. in connection with the reorganization, the parties desire to quantify, satisfy and administer crl's guarantee obligation to wec and lc in the manner described in this agreement. l. prior to the date of this agreement, wec sold 31,150 shares of katy stock and lc sold 56,000 shares of katy stock subject to the guarantee obligation described in this agreement. now, therefore, in consideration of these recitals, the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 1. guarantee obligations. crl hereby acknowledges and affirms its guarantee obligation to reimburse wec and lc for any financial loss that they have incurred as a result of purchases of the shares of katy stock (the "guarantee obligation") described in recital g above. for purposes of the foregoing, "financial loss" includes any decrease in market value, interest charges on the loans from crl, transaction costs, income taxes resulting from dividends or gains on sales of the katy stock and income taxes resulting from the payment of the guarantee obligation. dividends received and tax benefits resulting from losses on the sales of the katy stock shall be included in the calculation of the guarantee obligation in the manner set forth on exhibit a and exhibit b in determining the amount due to wec and lc, respectively. 2. treatment of guarantee to wec. the parties agree that the katy stock held by wec subject to the guarantee obligation by crl shall be valued at $11.10 per share as of the date of this agreement (as if such shares had been sold at a price of $11.10 per share as of the date of this agreement). accordingly, the value of the guarantee obligation due to wec by crl is fixed as of the date of this agreement as set forth on exhibit a and crl's net asset value for the purposes of the reorganization shall be reduced by the amount of such guarantee obligation to wec. after giving effect to the reorganization, as a result of which wec and his family trusts will own all of the outstanding capital stock of crl, the liability for the guarantee obligation to wec will be deemed to continue as a corporate liability of crl due to wec in the fixed amount set forth on exhibit a. 3. treatment of guarantee to lc. in connection with the reorganization, the parties agree that crl shall contribute to holden (in the manner described in recital j above) the liability representing the crl guarantee obligation to lc together with assets sufficient to fund the guarantee obligation based upon an assumed sales price of $11.10 per share of katy stock as determined in accordance with exhibit b. the net asset value of crl immediately prior to the reorganization shall be reduced by the value of the guarantee obligation due to lc based upon an assumed sales price of $11.10 per share as reflected on exhibit b. after contribution of the guarantee obligation by crl to holden, holden agrees that it shall be responsible for any payments due to lc upon sales of katy stock by lc subsequent to the date of the closing of the reorganization. upon any sales of katy stock subject to the guarantee obligation, lc shall submit sales information in writing to holden and holden shall pay to lc an amount equal to the guarantee obligation with respect to such shares (based upon the actual sales prices without regard to the assumed sales price referred to above). any sales of shares by lc at a price less than $11.10 per share resulting in an increase in the actual guarantee obligation shall require additional payment to holden by crl's former shareholders (proportionate to their holdings immediately prior to the reorganization) in which case holden shall exercise its rights under that certain allocation, indemnification and tax matters agreement of even date herewith to seek reimbursement from such former crl shareholders. any sales of shares by lc at a price greater than $11.10 per share resulting in a decrease in the actual guarantee obligation to lc shall inure to the benefit of the former crl shareholders such that the difference between the actual guarantee obligation and the assumed guarantee obligation on exhibit b shall be distributed by holden to the former shareholders of crl in proportion to their former shareholdings in crl immediately prior to the reorganization. crl, holden and lc agree that the guarantee obligation described in this agreement with respect to any shares not sold by lc within one year of the date of this agreement shall be satisfied in full by payment of the guarantee obligation by holden to lc based upon an assumed sales price of $11.10 per share which payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of the expiration of such one year period. 4. general provisions.

entities and trusts for their benefit are reorganizing certain of their various jointly and individually owned assets (the "reorganization"). c. pursuant to the reorganization, the parties anticipate that, among other things, certain of the shares beneficially owned by the shareholders may be transferred or sold such that the shareholders will reduce their beneficial interest in the corporation's shares and concurrently wec may seek to become the beneficial owner of additional shares of the corporation's outstanding stock. d. in connection with the reorganization, the parties have agreed to enter into this agreement which embodies the terms of the assurance by wec to the shareholders that they will receive at least $11.10 per share (the "guaranty amount") upon the sale of shares subject to this agreement (the "guaranty obligation") for each share transferred or sold by such shareholder pursuant to the terms of this agreement. e. the guaranty obligation initially arose as a result of informal arrangements among the parties initially discussed in late 1993 and early 1994 and the agreement of the shareholders to continue to hold the shares at such time. in connection with the reorganization, the parties now desire to memorialize such arrangements and agreements. f. as of the date of this agreement, certain shares held by the lelia carroll family shareholders identified in recital a have been sold in market transactions. the guarantee obligation with respect to such shares shall be subject to the provisions of section 1(e) below. now, therefore, in consideration of the covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. right of a transferring shareholder to put shares to wec. the parties agree that any shareholder desiring to effect a sale of shares (a "transferring shareholder") to an unaffiliated third party (as defined below) from time to time prior to the termination of this agreement pursuant to section 5 shall be entitled to put such shares to wec on the following terms and wec shall be obligated to make the payments to such transferring shareholder described below in accordance with this section 1: (a) delivery of put notice by transferring shareholder. at least three (3) business days prior to making any sale of shares to an unaffiliated third party at a gross sales price (as hereinafter defined) of less than the guaranty amount per share, the transferring shareholder shall deliver written notice of intent to sell to wec (a "put notice"). the put notice shall identify the proposed method of transfer as either a private transaction (a "private sale") or a sale into the market effected on the new york stock exchange (a "market sale"), the number of shares to be sold and, in the case of a private sale, the proposed or anticipated gross sales price per share. (b) procedures for proposed market sale. in the case of a proposed market sale, within the three (3) business day period following the delivery of the put notice (the "determination period") wec may deliver a notice to the transferring shareholder indicating wec's intent to perform under the guaranty obligation by purchasing all or a portion of the shares at $11.10 per share (a "buy notice"). if wec does not deliver a buy notice within the determination period or does not elect to purchase all of such shares, the transferring stockholder shall be free to sell the shares not covered by a buy notice in a market sale at any time or times during the thirty (30) day period following the expiration of the determination period. (c) procedures for proposed private sale. in the case of a proposed private sale, within the determination period wec may deliver to the transferring shareholder either a buy notice or a notice stating wec's objection to the private sale (an "objection"). if wec does not deliver a buy notice or an objection within the determination period or does not elect to purchase all of the shares, the transferring shareholder shall be free to sell the shares not covered by a buy notice or an objection in the private sale on the terms described in the put notice at any time during the thirty (30) day period following expiration of the determination period. if wec delivers an objection within the determination period, then the transferring shareholder shall not be entitled to sell such shares in the private sale, but instead shall be free to sell such shares in a market sale at any time or times during the thirty (30) day period following expiration of the determination period. (d) payment of purchase price by wec. the purchase and sale of shares pursuant to any buy notice delivered by wec shall be consummated no later than five (5) business days after the expiration of the determination period by payment of immediately available funds against delivery of the certificates evidencing the shares. (e) payment of guaranty obligation by wec. within fifteen (15) business days of the end of any calendar quarter in which a private sale or market sale by a transferring shareholder is consummated in accordance with the provisions described above, the transferring shareholder shall deliver written notice to wec specifying the number of shares sold during such calendar quarter, the sales date and the gross sales price per share. in the case of a private sale, the transferring shareholder shall certify in such written notice that the purchaser was an unaffiliated third party as defined below. within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of such written notice, wec shall pay to the transferring shareholder, in immediately available funds, the difference between the guaranty amount per share and the gross sales price per share for all shares sold during such calendar quarter. notwithstanding the foregoing, wec shall have no obligation to make the payment described above with respect to any shares sold in any private sale or market sale by a transferring shareholder which sale is not made in compliance with the notice and sale requirements in this section 1. (f) definitions. "gross sales price" as used in this agreement shall mean the gross price per share due to the transferring shareholder pursuant to a market sale or private sale prior to payment of any broker's commissions or other expenses. "unaffiliated third party" as used in this agreement shall mean a person or entity with which the transferring shareholder has no family relationship, equity interest, partnership interest or beneficial interest (including as a beneficiary of a trust) and which no member of the family of or person related to such transferring shareholder has any direct or indirect equity interest, partnership interest or beneficial interest (including as a beneficiary of a trust). 2. right of wec to call shares. at any time and from time to time prior to the termination of this agreement pursuant to section 6, wec shall have the right to call any or all of the shares subject to this agreement on the following terms and shall be obligated to make the payments to the shareholders described below in accordance with this section 2: (a) delivery of call notice by wec. at any time the trading price of the corporation's shares as reported on the new york stock exchange is less than $11.10 per share, subject to the terms of this section 2, wec may deliver a notice or notices to any shareholder of intent to perform under the guaranty obligation (a "call notice"). the call notice shall specify that wec either (i) desires to purchase such shares from the shareholder at a price equal to the guaranty amount or (ii) desires to perform under the guaranty obligation by making a cash payment as described below. the call notice shall specify the number of shares subject to the call notice (which may be all or any number of shares then held by a shareholder and subject to this agreement). notwithstanding the foregoing, any call notice delivered by wec which specifies wec's desire to perform under the guaranty obligation by making a cash payment pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be limited to a number of shares in the case of each shareholder which is equal to the number of shares which could be sold by such shareholder pursuant to rule 144(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended ("rule 144(e)") during the three month period following delivery of the call notice. the determination of the number of shares which could be sold by a shareholder under rule 144(e) shall be stated in the call notice delivered by wec. any dispute regarding such determination shall be resolved in accordance with section 5(c) below. upon such time as a shareholder ceases to be subject to the volume limitations of rule 144(e), wec shall be entitled to deliver a call notice specifying wec's desire to perform under the guaranty obligation by making a cash payment with respect to any number of shares held by such shareholder then subject to this agreement. the determination of whether a shareholder continues to be subject to the volume limitations of rule 144(e) shall be made in accordance with section 5(b) below, except that any opinion provided in accordance with section 5(b) shall be delivered concurrently with the call notice. nothing in this section 2(a) shall be deemed to limit the number of shares for which wec may deliver a call notice specifying wec's desire to purchase such shares pursuant to clause (i) above. (b) procedures for purchase of shares by wec. within the three (3) business day period following receipt of the call notice which specifies wec's desire to purchase such shares, the shareholder receiving such notice shall have the right to indicate to wec by delivery of a notice (a "receipt notice") whether such shareholder instead desires to have wec perform under the guaranty obligation by making a cash payment. failure to deliver a receipt notice shall constitute agreement to sell such shares to wec, in which event such sale shall be consummated no later than five (5) business days after delivery of the call notice. in the event a receipt notice is delivered, the procedures for cash payment by wec to satisfy the guaranty obligation in section 2(c) below shall be followed. (c) procedures for cash payment by wec to satisfy guaranty obligation. in the case of a call notice specifying wec's desire to perform under the guaranty obligation by making a cash payment, within five (5) business days after delivery of the call notice wec shall deliver to such shareholder cash or immediately available funds in an amount equal to the difference between the guaranty amount for such shares and the average of the closing prices of the corporation's shares on the new york stock exchange during the five (5) business day period prior to delivery of the call notice. in the event a receipt notice is delivered pursuant to section 2(b) above which states that the shareholder desires to have wec perform under the guaranty obligation by making a cash payment, then within five (5) business days after the delivery of the receipt notice, wec shall have the option to deliver to such shareholder cash or immediately available funds in an amount equal to the difference between the guaranty amount for such shares and the average of the closing prices of the corporation's shares on the new york stock exchange during the five (5) business day period prior to delivery of the call notice. if wec exercises such option, the shares for which the payment described above is made shall no longer be subject to the guaranty obligation which shall be deemed satisfied with respect to such shares. if wec does not exercise such option then the shares which are covered by the receipt notice shall continue to be subject to the guaranty obligation under the provisions of this agreement. (d) reconciliation of call notice and put notice. notwithstanding the foregoing, wec shall not be entitled to deliver a call notice with respect to any shares for which a put notice has been delivered, until expiration of the thirty (30) day periods described in section 1(b) and (c) following delivery of a put notice. in the event a put notice and call notice shall be deemed given and delivered on the same date pursuant to section 9(i) below, the put notice shall be deemed to have been given and delivered prior to such call notice. 3. adjustments to guaranty amount. in the event of the occurrence of an adjustment event (as defined below), the guaranty amount shall be adjusted in a manner such that the intent of the parties hereto is preserved. accordingly, upon the occurrence of an adjustment event, the guaranty amount per share shall be the product of (i) the amount that otherwise would have been the guaranty amount had the adjustment event never occurred, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares owned by the applicable shareholder immediately prior to the occurrence of the adjustment event, and the denominator of which is the number of shares owned by the applicable shareholder immediately after the occurrence of the adjustment event. for purposes of this agreement, an "adjustment event" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) a stock split or other subdivision of the corporation's outstanding shares into a greater number of shares; (b) a reverse stock split or other combination of the corporation's outstanding shares into a smaller number of shares; (c) a distribution of the corporation's shares with respect to outstanding shares; or (d) any other event concerning the shares which does not fall strictly within the foregoing definitions of adjustment events but, in the opinion of the accountants (as defined below), should be treated as an adjustment event in order to preserve the essential intent of the parties hereto and the principles hereof. 4. accountants' report as to adjustments to guaranty amount. in the case of each adjustment event pursuant to section 3 above, the parties hereto shall request deloitte & touche, or such other independent certified public accountants of recognized national standing (who may be the regular accountants of the corporation) who are mutually acceptable to the majority shareholders (as defined below) and wec (the "accountants"), to compute promptly such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of this agreement and to prepare a report setting forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in reasonable detail the method of calculation thereof and the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the parties hereto shall cause the accountants to mail a copy of each such report to each party hereto. the fees and expenses of such accountants shall be borne by wec. 5. termination of agreement and guaranty obligation; information requirements. (a) the parties hereto agree that this agreement and the guaranty obligation of wec shall automatically and immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the date that no shares remain subject to section 1 of this agreement and all of wec's payment obligations under sections 1 and 2 of this agreement have been satisfied. (b) the guaranty obligation of wec shall also terminate with respect to any shares held by a shareholder as of the day immediately following the last day of any calendar quarter during which the closing price per share as reflected on the nyse has equaled or exceeded $11.10 for at least ten (10) business days, provided that such shareholder is not then subject to the volume limitations of rule 144(e). the determination that a shareholder is no longer subject to the volume limitations of rule 144(e) shall be based upon either of the following: (i) a shareholder's sale of shares in a market sale not in compliance with or in reliance upon rule 144(e) shall constitute a determination for purposes of this agreement that the shareholder is no longer subject to the volume limitations of rule 144(e) or (ii) delivery of a written opinion of counsel retained by wec (which counsel is satisfactory to the company) that it is the opinion of counsel that a particular shareholder is no longer subject to the volume limitations of rule 144(e); provided a copy of such opinion is delivered to such shareholder prior to the commencement of any calendar quarter described in this section 5(b). notwithstanding the foregoing, such opinion shall not be utilized by any shareholder for purposes of making any market sale without the prior written consent of wec and the counsel rendering such opinion. in the event the shareholder requests such written consent or wishes to utilize such opinion for the purposes of making any market sale, the shareholder (or group of affiliated shareholders making such request) shall be obligated to pay one-half of all expenses and fees of such counsel for the rendering of such opinion (including the initial opinion delivered to wec on which any subsequent opinion is based); provided, however, the shareholder (or group of affiliated shareholders making such request) shall in no event be required to pay expenses and fees of such counsel in excess of $5,000. the remaining balance of all such expenses shall be borne by wec. (c) if a shareholder continues to be subject to the volume limitations of rule 144(e) and during any calendar quarter the closing price per share as reflected on the nyse has equaled or exceeded $11.10 for at least (10) business days, then the guaranty obligation shall terminate effective as of the day immediately following the last day of such calendar quarter with respect to the number of shares that could have been sold by a shareholder during such calendar quarter in reliance upon rule 144(e) (less any shares actually sold during such calendar quarter in a market sale). within ten (10) business days following the end of any such calendar quarter, wec shall deliver written notice of the number of shares no longer subject to this agreement to the holder of such shares. any dispute between wec and such shareholder regarding such calculation shall be resolved by the determination of independent counsel mutually agreeable to and selected by wec and such shareholder with the costs of such counsel being borne one-half by wec and one-half by such shareholder. (d) notwithstanding the fact that a put notice may have been delivered prior to the expiration of a calendar quarter, wec shall have no obligation to make payment of the guaranty obligation for any shares sold by a shareholder in a market sale or private sale occurring after the expiration of such calendar quarter if the guaranty obligation of wec with respect to such shares terminates pursuant to section 5(b) or (c) above. for purposes of the foregoing sentence, a sale shall be deemed to occur after the expiration of such calendar quarter if the sale order is placed with a broker (i.e., the "trade date") after the expiration of such calendar quarter or, in the case of a private sale, the contract closing date occurs after the expiration of such calendar quarter. notwithstanding the fact that a call notice may have been delivered prior to the expiration of a calendar quarter, the parties shall have no obligation to perform under section 2 after the expiration of such calendar quarter with respect to any shares to which the guaranty obligation has terminated pursuant to section 5(b) or (c) above unless the period for delivery of a receipt notice has expired prior to the expiration of such calendar quarter. (e) for purposes of enabling the parties to make the determinations set forth in this section 5 and also in section 2(a) above, each shareholder agrees to provide sales information (including date, amount, price and method of sale) and aggregate holdings information with respect to all shares subject to this agreement within five (5) business days of a written request from wec. 6. definitions. as used in this agreement, the term "majority shareholders" shall mean shareholders holding in the aggregate a majority of the shares subject to the terms of this agreement at the time of such determination. as used in this agreement, the term "business day" means a day on which the new york stock exchange is open for trading and shares of common stock of the corporation are traded on the new york stock exchange. 7. integration; amendment. this agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations, undertakings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. with respect to each party to this agreement, no representation, inducement, agreement, promise, understanding or waiver altering, modifying, taking from or adding to the terms, provisions or conditions hereof shall have any force or effect unless the same is in writing and duly executed by wec and such party. nothing in this agreement shall be deemed to preclude wec and any shareholder from amending, modifying or waiving any of the terms or provisions of this agreement as it relates to such shareholder but no such amendment, modification or waiver shall affect any other shareholder unless such other shareholder agrees in writing to be bound by such amendment, modification or waiver. 8. notices. any notice, request, instruction or other communication to be given and delivered hereunder by any party hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) on the date of delivery, provided delivery is actually tendered at the appropriate address, addressed to the persons identified below (a) in person, or
