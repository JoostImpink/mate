(b) any transferee of interests shall be required, at the time of and as a condition to such transfer, to become a party to this agreement by executing and delivering such documents as may be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of the board, to make such person a party thereto, whereupon such transferee will be treated as a member for all purposes of this agreement. such transferee shall, among other things, provide to the secretary of the company the address of such transferee to which notices hereunder shall be sent. in addition, no member shall be entitled to transfer any interests or any other rights under this agreement (including to an affiliate) at any time unless the board is reasonably satisfied that such transfer would not: (i) violate the securities act or any state (or other jurisdiction) securities or "blue sky" laws applicable to the company or the interests; (ii) cause the company to become subject to the registration requirements of the investment company act; (iii) be a "prohibited transaction" under erisa or the code or cause all or any portion of the assets of the company to constitute "plan assets" under erisa or section 4975 of the code; and (iv) cause the company to become a "publicly-traded partnership", as such term is defined in sections 469(k)(2) or 7704 of the code.

(d) any member that proposes to transfer interests in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof shall be responsible for any expenses incurred by the company in connection with such transfer, other than pursuant to the exercise of registration rights under the bfs stockholders agreement, in which case the expenses thereof are treated in accordance with the provisions of the bfs stockholders agreement. 8.2 restriction on transfers of bfs shares.

(iii) all transfers of bfs shares held by the company on behalf of a member made during the limited transfer period must be preceded by at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the non-transferring member. (iv) for purposes of this section 8.2(b), all percentages of bfs shares shall be computed based on (i) the number of bfs shares held by the company on behalf of a member as of the first day of the limited transfer period, minus (ii) any bfs shares transferred on behalf of such member upon the exercise of registration rights pursuant to article ix hereof during the limited transfer period, in each case, subject to adjustment for any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction effected during the limited transfer period. (c) post limited transfer period. following the expiration of the limited transfer period, any member may cause the company to transfer any or all of the bfs shares held by the company on behalf of such member, in one transaction or a series of transactions, provided any such transfer(s) complies with all applicable laws, including federal and state securities laws.

(b) the demanding member shall be entitled to select a nationally recognized managing underwriter or underwriters to manage and administer any offerings of registrable shares in connection with the exercise of a demand right (and the company shall notify bfs of any such selection), such underwriter or underwriters, as the case may be, to be subject to the approval of bfs in accordance with the bfs stockholders agreement. any member seeking to exercise a demand right shall give written notice (a "demand notice") to the company and each of the other members in accordance with section 14.1, notifying the company and such other members of: (i) the demanding member's intent to exercise a demand right; (ii) the number of bfs shares the demanding member intends to cause bfs to register; (iii) the intended method of distribution of the registrable shares; and (iv) the name and address of the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, selected by the demanding member for the offering. within ten (10) business days after receipt of a demand notice, each member desiring to participate in the demand registration shall give written notice (a "demand participation notice") to the company and the demanding member specifying the number of registrable shares held by the company and deemed to be owned by such member (each, a "participating member") which such participating member has elected to include in such demand registration. subject to section 9.4, the company shall include in the demand registration all registrable shares then held by the company and requested to be included in such demand registration by the participating members deemed to own such registrable shares and from whom the company has received a demand participation notice within ten (10) business days after the date that the demand notice was delivered.
