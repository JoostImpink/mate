item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that follow in this annual report on form k overview historically our quantitative radio ratings services and related software have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue our quantitative radio ratings services and related software accounted for approximately percent of our total revenue in each of the years ended december and approximately percent of our total revenue for was derived from local radio ratings services of which approximately percent was from the ppm markets and percent was from our diary markets we have one segment which meets the quantitative thresholds for being a reportable segment while we expect our quantitative radio ratings services and related software licensing will continue to account for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future we are actively seeking opportunities to diversify our revenue base by among other things leveraging the investment we have made in our ppm ratings service and technology we have commercialized our ppm ratings service in of the largest united states radio markets these agreements provide for a higher fee for ppm based ratings than we charged for our diary based ratings our customer contracts are typically structured to phase in higher ppm service rates over multiple years including for some customers as we commercialized the ppm ratings service over several years we incurred expenses to build the ppm panel in each ppm market in the months before commercializing the service in that market these costs were incremental to the costs associated with our diary based ratings service during those periods with the completion of our previously announced commercialization plan as of december our future performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and industries we serve including our ability to continue to maintain and improve the quality of our ppm and diary ratings service and manage increased costs for data collection arising from among other items address based sampling targeted in person recruiting and increased numbers of cell phone households which are more expensive for us to recruit than households with landline phones we currently anticipate that the aggregate cost of cell phone household recruitment for the ppm and diary services address based sampling in ppm markets and targeted in person recruitment for the ppm service will be approximately million in as compared to approximately million in in addition we are currently subject to us and international data protection and privacy statutes rules and regulations and may in the future become subject to additional such statutes rules and regulations complying with these laws may require us to make certain investments make modifications to existing services or prohibit us from offering certain types of services any of which may be material and adversely impact our financial results failing to comply could result in civil and criminal liability negative publicity data being blocked from use and liability under contracts with our customers vendors and partners pending merger with nielsen on december nielsen a leading global provider of information and insights into what consumers watch and buy entered into an agreement and plan of merger as amended by amendment no to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of january the merger agreement to acquire arbitron the merger under the terms of the merger agreement nielsen has agreed to acquire all of our outstanding common stock for per share in cash which represented a premium of approximately percent to our closing price on december the transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions including a regulatory review and approval by arbitrons stockholders for additional information regarding the business risks associated with pursuing the merger see item a risk factors risk factors relating to the merger in this annual report on form k table of contents sale of tra investment during july we sold our investment in tra for approximately million which was approximately equal to its million carrying value at the time of the sale cash proceeds received from the sale amounted to approximately million with an additional million deposited in escrow the escrow funds will be released to us in january less any claims pending against the escrow account the escrow fund deposit is recorded on our balance sheet as a portion of our non current assets stock repurchases on february our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million in shares of our outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations at then prevailing market prices over a period of up to two years ending february as of december we repurchased shares of outstanding common stock under this program for approximately million we have not made any stock repurchases during through the date that we filed this annual report on form k with the sec concentration of customers we depend on a limited number of key customers for our ratings services and related software for example in clear channel represented approximately percent of our total revenue additionally the amount of contract term revenue associated with customer contracts expiring in is larger as compared to historical average annual renewal levels if one or more key customers do not renew all or part of their contracts as they expire we could experience a significant decrease in our operating results critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial position or results of operations and require our most difficult complex or subjective judgments software development costs we capitalize software development costs with respect to significant internal use software initiatives or enhancements from the time the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable the software will be used to perform the function intended until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use once the software is placed in service the capitalized costs are amortized over periods of three to five years we perform an assessment quarterly to determine if it is probable all capitalized software will be used to perform its intended function if an impairment exists the software cost is written down to estimated fair value as of december and our capitalized software developed for internal use had carrying amounts of million and million respectively including million and million respectively of software related to the ppm service deferred income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns we must make assumptions judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account forecasts of the amount and nature of future taxable income actual operating results and the underlying amount and nature of income in future years could render current assumptions judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets inaccurate we table of contents believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets any of the assumptions judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause actual income tax obligations to differ from estimates thus impacting our financial position and results of operations we include in our tax calculation methodology an assessment of the uncertainty in income taxes by establishing recognition thresholds for our tax positions inherent in our calculation are critical judgments by management related to the determination of the basis for our tax positions for further information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k insurance receivables during we became involved in two securities law civil actions and a governmental interaction primarily related to the commercialization of our ppm service since we have incurred a total of million in legal fees and expenses in connection with these matters as of december an aggregate of million in insurance reimbursements related to these legal actions had been received additionally in we submitted claims for business interruption losses incurred by hurricane sandy our aggregate insurance claims receivable related to these legal actions as well as hurricane sandy was million and million as of december and respectively these amounts are included in our prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our insurance recovery receivables contingent consideration the agreement governing the acquisition of zokem oy now arbitron mobile oy arbitron mobile provides for possible additional cash payments to be made by us to the former zokem shareholders through of up to million contingent upon arbitron mobile reaching certain financial performance targets during the four year measurement period of through we estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration to be approximately million as of the july acquisition date we periodically estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration and any change in fair value will be recognized in our consolidated financial results of operations an increase in the contingent consideration expected to be paid will result in a charge to operations in the quarter the anticipated fair value of contingent consideration increases while a decrease in the contingent consideration expected to be paid will result in a credit to operations in the quarter the anticipated fair value of contingent consideration decreases the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration requires subjective assumptions to be made of future operating results we decreased our fair value estimate of the contingent consideration from million at december to million at december due to a decrease in forecasted revenues and earnings during the measurement period future revisions to our assumptions could materially change our estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration and therefore materially affect our future financial results and financial condition table of contents results of

by up to million to an aggregate of million such increased financing would be provided by one or more existing credit facility lending institutions subject to the approval of the lending banks and or in combination with one or more new lending institutions subject to the approval of the credit facilitys administrative agent interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to six months or with the consent of each lender nine or months at which time the interest rate is reset based upon the libor our credit facility contains financial terms covenants and operating restrictions that potentially restrict our financial flexibility the material debt covenants under our credit facility include both a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio the leverage ratio is a non gaap financial measure equal to the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness as defined in our credit facility divided by a contractually defined adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarter period the interest coverage ratio is a non gaap financial measure equal to consolidated ebitda divided by total interest expense both ratios are designed as measures of our ability to meet current and future debt obligations the following table presents the actual ratios and their threshold limits as defined by the credit facility as of december covenant threshold actual maximum leverage ratio minimum interest coverage ratio as of december based upon these financial covenants there was no default or limit on our ability to borrow the unused portion of our credit facility our credit facility contains customary events of default including nonpayment and breach covenants in the event of default repayment of borrowings under the credit facility could be accelerated our credit facility also contains cross default provisions whereby a default on any material indebtedness as defined in the credit facility could result in the acceleration of our outstanding debt and the termination of any unused commitment under the credit facility the agreement potentially limits among other things our ability to sell assets incur additional indebtedness and grant or incur liens on our assets under the terms of the credit facility all of our material domestic subsidiaries if any must guarantee the commitment currently we do not have any material domestic subsidiaries as defined under the terms of the credit facility although we do not believe the terms of our credit facility limit the operation of our business in any material respect the terms of the credit facility may restrict or prohibit our ability to raise additional debt when needed or could prevent us from investing in other growth initiatives we have been in compliance with the terms of the credit facility since the inception of the agreement as of february we had

issued accounting standards update no intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived assets for impairment asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case it is necessary to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test otherwise the entity need not perform the quantitative impairment test asu is effective for us beginning with interim and annual periods ended during we do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements comprehensive income presentation in february the fasb issued accounting standards update no comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu to require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts asu is effective for the company beginning with interim and annual periods ended during the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates as such changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash and cash equivalents and other highly liquid

the credit facility is calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to nine months at which time the interest rate is reset based upon the libor as of december we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility therefore a hypothetical market interest rate change of would have zero impact on our results of operations over a month period a hypothetical market interest rate change of would have no impact on either the carrying amount or the fair value of the credit facility we do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes foreign currency risk we are exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar our principal exposures are to the euro via our finnish subsidiary and the indian rupee via our indian subsidiary if we expand our foreign operations in both finland and india our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate trends could increase resulting in higher or lower translation impacts to our financial results and position as of december we had million in recorded intercompany balances on our finnish and indian subsidiary balance sheets which are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates as the exchange rates increase or decrease our intercompany balances will be exposed to translation adjustment charges and or credits which will be recognized in our financial results financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at current rates at the end of the period except that revenue and expenses are translated at average current exchange rates during each reporting period the translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet until the net investment in such foreign subsidiaries is liquidated as of december the cumulative net currency translation adjustment recorded on our balance sheet reduced our shareholders equity by million table of contents
