item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation core laboratories nv is a netherlands limited liability company we were established in and are one of the worlds leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description production enhancement and reservoir management products and services to the oil and gas industry primarily through customer relationships with many of the worlds major national and independent oil companies our business units have been aggregated into three complementary segments reservoir description encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock fluid and gas samples we provide analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry production enhancement includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions perforations stimulations and production we provide integrated services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects reservoir management combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients reservoirs in april we sold our specialized geophysical and seismic related business which was previously included as a component of our reservoir management business we recorded a loss of million net of tax related to this discontinued operation during the year ended december general overview we provide services and design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields these services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in exploration and development efforts to explore new fields or to increase productivity in existing fields our clients investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate to oil and natural gas commodity prices during periods of higher prices our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and during periods of lower commodity prices they tend to invest less accordingly the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products commodity prices for crude oil fluctuated throughout ending the year down from levels attained earlier in the year however activity levels in the oilfield service sector increased during the year the following table summarizes the average worldwide and us rig counts for the years ended december and as well as the spot price of a barrel of west texas intermediate crude and an mcf of natural gas at the dates then ended rig countoil and gas prices as of december worldwide rig count us rig count crude oil price per barrel wti spot natural gas price spot average per mcf baker hughes incorporated world wide rig count obtained from lehman brothers us department of energy henry hub spot price at per the new york mercantile exchange the price of natural gas in declined throughout the year when compared with the price in and these lower prices were attributable to various market factors including a general decline in natural gas consumption general oil market conditions in the united states improved and contributed to maintaining the price for derivative crude oil products and petrochemical products in our activity levels continue to increase as oilfield activities by our customers increase these higher activity levels resulted in increased revenues for us in primarily for our reservoir description and production enhancement business segments given these higher revenues in conjunction with efforts to contain our cost structure we were able to generate operating income that was greater than the prior year our reservoir description segment showed improvement in almost all operations primarily as a result of the spending levels of our clients aimed at characterizing and analyzing reservoirs crude oil and derivative products operating income from our production enhancement segment was up over the prior year as more wells in north america were drilled and stimulated than in the prior year which provides greater opportunity for our clients to use our products and services in april we sold our seismic related business which had become less profitable in recent years due to increased competition which contributed to lower margins the results for our reservoir management group improved over the prior year due primarily to a re focus of our efforts on integrated solutions for clients outlook we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening facilities in strategic areas and realizing synergies within our business lines we believe our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service customers who have global operations in addition to the national oil companies we have established internal earnings targets that are based on current market conditions based on discussions with our clients and our view of the industry we anticipate that in spending by our clients will increase approximately attaining our internal targets is dependent on sustained oilfield activity we expect to meet ongoing working capital needs capital expenditure requirements and funding of our share repurchase program from a combination of cash on hand cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions during their preparation which requires judgment our accounting policies and procedures are explained in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k the following transaction types require significant judgment and therefore are considered critical accounting policies as of december revenue recognition revenues are recognized as services are completed or as product title is transferred all advance client payments are classified as unearned revenues until services are performed or product title is transferred we recognize revenue when we determine that the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured revenues from long term contracts are recorded as services are rendered in proportion to the work performed all known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for currently training and consulting service revenues are recognized as the services are performed allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and monitor collections and payments in order to maintain a provision for estimated uncollectible accounts based on our historical collection experience and our current aging of client receivables outstanding in addition to clients representations and our understanding of the economic environment in which our clients operate based on our review we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable as a whole our allowance for doubtful accounts at december was million compared to million at december long lived assets intangibles and goodwill property plant and equipment are carried at cost major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the respective assets remaining useful life maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred when long lived assets are sold or retired the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income property plant and equipment held and used is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable over the remaining service life indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle use or significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the net book value of the assets or carrying value is determined to be unrecoverable and the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows the calculation of fair value requires estimates of future cash flows and such estimates can change based on market conditions technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry we did not record impairment charges related to our long lived assets held for use in continuing operations during the years ended december or we review our goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations at least annually for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs which may indicate impairment during the year we evaluated assets with indefinite lives including goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment comparing the fair value of our reportable segments to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date after excluding inter company transactions and allocating corporate assets to the reportable segments fair value is determined by projecting future cash flows on a discounted basis if the carrying value of the reportable segment exceeds the fair value determined impairment may be indicated if impairment is indicated the fair value of the reportable segment would be determined any remaining goodwill would be deemed impaired and charged to income during the period the impairment was identified any subsequent impairment loss c ould result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations inventory valuation allowances our valuation reserve for inventory is based on historical regional sales trends and various other assumptions and judgments including future demand for this inventory should these assumptions and judgments not occur our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory our valuation reserve for inventory at december was million compared to million at december if we over or underestimate demand for inventory it could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations income taxes our income tax expense includes income taxes of the netherlands the us and other foreign countries as well as local state and provincial income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated million and million at december and respectively if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a m aterial adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows stock based compensation effective january we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no r share based payment sfas r sfas r using the modified prospective transition method under that transition method compensation expense that we recognized for the year ended december included a compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas accounting for stock based compensation and b compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r results from prior periods have not been restated this statement requires compensation costs related to share based payments including stock options to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values th e expense is recognized over the requisite service period of the award we previously recognized expense for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb accordingly compensation expense was recognized for the excess if any of the stock price on the grant date over the option exercise price no compensation expense was recorded under apb for awards granted under our employee stock option plan as all options issued had exercise prices at least equal to the fair value of the stock on the grant date the pro forma effects upon net income and earnings per share for stock options are disclosed below per sfas statement no accounting for stock based compensation estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances by nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the following table summarizes key estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december and account nature of estimates required assumptions used allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate whether client receivables are collectible see allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves we forecast client demand considering changes in technology which could result in obsolescence see inventory valuation allowances depreciation and amortization we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets useful lives assigned reflect our best estimate based on historical data of the respective assets useful life and salvage value these assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes pensions and other postretirement benefits we utilize an actuary to determine the value of the projected benefit obligation under a dutch pension plan this valuation requires various estimates and assumptions concerning mortality future pay increases and discount rate used to value our obligations in addition we recognize net periodic benefit cost based upon these estimates the actuarial assumptions used are based upon professional judgment and historical experience including trends in mortality rates and credit market rates discount rate stock based compensation we evaluate the probability that certain of our stock based plans will meet targets established within the respective agreements and result in the vesting of such awards in addition we derive a forfeiture rate that is used in calculating the expense for these awards see stock based compensation comparisons to either our stock price a return on our stock price compared to certain stock indices or a return on equity calculation income taxes we estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets particularly net operating loss carry forwards see income taxes we examine our historical and projected operating results review the eligible carry forward period and tax planning opportunities and consider other relevant information changes in tax laws for the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly impact our estimates long lived assets intangibles and goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of our assets periodically but at least annually by examining current and projected operating results to identify any triggering events which may indicate impairment we compare the carrying value of the assets to a projection of fair value utilizing judgment as to the identification of reporting units the allocation of corporate assets amongst reporting units and the determination of the appropriate discount rate see long lived assets intangibles and goodwill our impairment analysis is subjective and includes estimates based on assumptions regarding future growth rates and operating expenses off balance sheet arrangements other than normal operating leases we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements such as securitization agreements liquidity trust vehicles synthetic leases or special purpose entities as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements results of operations results of operations as a percentage of applicable revenues are as follows dollars in thousands year ended change revenues services product sales operating expenses cost of services* cost of sales* total cost of services and sales general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization other expense income net nm operating income debt prepayment charge interest expense income before income tax expense income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations nm net income *percentage based on applicable revenue rather than total revenue nm means not meaningful operating results for the year ended december compared to the years ended december and we evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenues operating income margin defined as operating income divided by total revenue and income margin defined as income from continuing operations divided by total revenue since we have a relatively fixed cost structure increases in revenues generally translate into higher operating income margin and income margin percentages results for the years ended december and are summarized in the following chart service revenues service revenues increased to million for from million for and million for these year over year increases in service revenues were largely attributable to an overall increase in worldwide oilfield activities and acceptance of recently introduced services by our customers the worldwide operating rig count increased to at december from and at december and respectively as derived from published reports from baker hughes incorporated this overall increase in drilling related activity created greater demand for our services as in our revenues increased in primarily as a result of greater demand across all three business segments from increased oilfield activities in north america europe west africa and the far east product sale revenues product sale revenues increased to million for from million for and million for these incremental improvements in revenue were consistent with the higher revenues we experienced for our services a year over year increase for the period ended december the continuing increases we have realized were primarily the result of increased drilling activity on a global basis but more specifically for natural gas in the north american markets which resulted in higher demand for our well completion products along with the acceptance of new products and technologies we have recently introduced to the market cost of services cost of services increased to million for from million for and million for when is compared to as a percentage of service revenue cost of services decreased from to the decline in the cost of services relative to service revenue was primarily a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure incremental margins are calculated as the change in operating income divided by the change in revenues for compared to as a percentage of service revenue cost of services decreased by two percentage points this decrease was primarily a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure cost of sales cost of sales increased to million for from million for and million for as a percentage of product sale revenues cost of sales decreased to for compared to for and for the improvement in margin for compared to and was largely attributable to the growing demand for our new technologies which are our higher margin products from an overall increase in sales continued efforts to enhance our manufacturing efficiencies and improved inventory management general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operating subsidiaries our general and administrative expenses decreased million in compared to due primarily to an additional charge related to our stock based compensation plans in this additional charge contributed to the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to as well as higher accounting fees of million relating to the implementation of rule of the sarbanes oxley act of and various other elements depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures as we continue to grow the company depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to this decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a general run off of depreciation expense associated with older assets offset by an increase in capital expenditures in other expense income net the components of other expense income net were as follows in thousands year ended minority interest gain loss on sale of assets equity in loss income of affiliates foreign exchange gain loss interest income gain on involuntary sale of asset gain on insurance recovery other total other expense income net in the british government notified us that it would exercise its right of eminent domain thereby involuntarily acquiring the property of one of our operating facilities prior to december we received an initial payment from the british government for million as compensation for this property in the second quarter of we negotiated and received a settlement which resulted in a million gain in the fourth quarter of we received a final settlement which resulted in a million gain in excess of the gain recorded in during the first quarter of a building at our manufacturing plant in godley texas was damaged by fire resulting in the loss of the building some inventory as well as other business equipment and supplies in june we filed claims with our insurance carrier for reimbursement of these costs resulting in a gain of million in addition we filed a claim for business interruption costs and the final settlement was reached in the first quarter of which resulted in a gain of million in excess of the gain recorded in debt prepayment charge in december we repaid our senior notes in connection with the early prepayment we incurred a prepayment penalty of million see credit facilities and available future liquidity interest expense interest expense decreased million in compared to due to the refinancing of our debt positions over the past year in which we utilized our revolving credit facility to extinguish our senior notes which bore an average interest rate of at the end of in the fourth quarter of we issued senior exchangeable debt securities at which the proceeds were used to pay off our credit facility at which time bore an average interest rate of for the period outstanding in interest expense remained basically unchanged in compared to due to higher borrowing rates under our long term revolving credit facility which increased to an average of for compared to an average of for which was offset by a lower outstanding balance income tax expense income tax expense increased million in compared to this change was due to an increase in income before income taxes of million off set by a decrease in the effective tax rate for the year income tax expense increased million in compared to this increase was due to an increase in income before income taxes of million coupled with an increase in the effective tax rate for the year the effective tax rate was for for and for in we released approximately million of the valuation allowance due to an increase in tax profits which was primarily offset by an increase in our provision for tax controversies in various jurisdictions the change in the tax rate from is primarily a result in a change in activity levels between jurisdictions with different tax rates discontinued operations as a result of the sale of our seismic business in april we recorded a loss for discontinued operations totaling million net of tax this loss included charges related to the impairment of goodwill certain intangible assets and other long lived assets totaling million and a charge of million to the provision for doubtful accounts as well as other working capital adjustments in we finalized the terms under the contract for sale of the business through a negotiated payment of million net of taxes segment analysis the following charts and tables summarize the operating results for our three complementary business segments segment revenue for the years ended december dollars in thousands change change reservoir description production enhancement reservoir management total revenues segment operating income for the years ended december

directly related to a particular segment nm means not meaningful segment operating income margins for the years ended december margin margin margin reservoir description production enhancement reservoir management total company calculated by dividing operating income by revenue reservoir description revenues for our reservoir description segment increased by in compared to and grew in compared to these revenue increases resulted from continued expansion of oilfield activities world wide and north american projects related to unconventional gas reservoirs as in revenues for were also positively impacted by increased demand for our fluid characterization services in europe and the us for compared to we experienced an increase in demand for our reservoir rock analysis as well as our fluid analysis services in north america west africa middle east and the far east operating income and operating income margin for the reservoir description segment increased due to continued growth of higher value added and consequently higher margin products which resulted in increases in margins throughout the majority of the regions with significant increases in asia pacific and the us for compared to operating income increased primarily as a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure increases in north america and europe more than offset operating income declines in mexico and certain regions of the former soviet union where we continued to experience margin erosion due to increased competition production enhancement revenues for our production enhancement business segment grew in compared to primarily due to the acceptance of recently introduced products and services coupled with a continued expansion in global drilling activities in with the increase in drilling activities demand for our well perforating and completion products and diagnostic services has also increased facilitated by the continued improvements in our technologies such as the completion profilertrade gtx spantrade and herotrade revenues grew in compared to primarily due to the introduction of new technology and to the increase in north america natural gas drilling activity in relative to with the increase in drilling activities the demand for our well perforating and completion products and diagnostic services has also increased the primary products and services offered by this segment operating income for this segment increased to million in from million in an increase of operating income increased to million in up from million in these continued improvements were due primarily to increased sales of higher margin services and products including new enhanced recovery technology such as spectrascantrade spectrastimtrade and completion profilertrade also higher margin gtx spantrade casing patches and herotrade perforating charges and gun systems increased with global demand while improvements in manufacturing efficiencies resulted in higher productivity per employee and lower overall costs per unit additionally the demand for our technology in fracture diagnostics continued to increase as drilling activity increased in unconventional gas reservoirs reservoir management revenues for our reservoir management segment increased by in compared to and in compared to the continued increase was due to higher revenue for multi client reservoir studies especially studies pertaining to unconventional gas reservoirs and increased international demand for our reservoir monitoring systems significant studies in and were reservoir characterization and production properties of gas shales and geological petrophysical and geomechanical properties of tight gas sands and in they included a regional study of the reservoir lithologies from fields and basins in libya as well as reservoir quality reservoir quality prediction and seal rock evaluation deep shelf gulf of mexico and several other proprietary studies operating income for this segment increased in compared to and in compared to primarily due to incremental margins earned from the continued expansion of the multi client reservoir study sales in the us and expansion of studies being performed both onshore and offshore libya liquidity and capital resources general we have historically financed our activities through cash on hand cash flows from operations bank credit facilities equity financing and the issuance of debt cash flow from operating activities provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs capital expenditures and our share repurchase program if necessary we supplement this cash flow with borrowings under bank credit facilities to finance some capital expenditures and business acquisitions as we are a netherlands holding company we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries our cash flow is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us we utilize the non gaap financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations before the impact of the debt prepayment charge less capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it represents the cash in excess of capital expenditures available to operate the business and fund non discretionary obligations the following table reconciles this non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for the years ended december and year ended december free cash flow calculation unaudited in thousands net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations add debt prepayment charge less capital expenditures free cash flow the increase in free cash flow in compared to and was due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily as a result of higher net income working capital was million and million at december and respectively cash flows the following table summarizes cash flows from continuing operations for the years ended december and in thousands year ended december continuing operations cash provided byused in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the increase in cash flow from operating activities in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net income accounts receivable and current liabilities offset by a decrease in stock compensation the increase in cash flow from operating activities in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for stock based compensation debt refinancing charges and the increase in long term deferred revenue from the sale of analysis studies cash flow used in investing activities increased million in over due to an increase in capital expenditures for and a lower level of proceeds received from disposal of property capital expenditures made in were for replacement of in place equipment and for growth through additional equipment and instrumentation in growing markets cash flow used for investing activities increased million in over due to an increase in capital expenditures for offset by no acquisitions being made and a higher level of proceeds received from disposal of property principally as a result of a settlement we reached with the british government after they exercised their right of eminent domain over one of our locations capital expenditures made in were for replacement of in place equipment and for additional equipment and instrumentation in growing markets cash flow used in financing activities in was comparable to but decreased slightly overall there were several significant financing activities conducted in in november we issued million of exchangeable notes and in connection with this transaction we purchased a call option hedge on the notes and issued a warrant on our stock these transactions net of the debt financing costs generated cash flow of approximately million the net proceeds received from these transactions were primarily used on other financing activities such as paying off the million outstanding balance of our existing credit facility and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase program in we repurchased of our common shares at a cost of million which was million more than additionally cash received from exercised stock options and the tax benefit received from stock based payments was mill ion greater in as compared to cash flow used in financing activities increased in compared to as we paid down debt in our financing activities reflected a net repayment of debt of million in and million in in we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock while in we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock this share repurchase program was approved by our shareholders in connection with our initial public offering in september and repurchases began on october under the program we were authorized to repurchase up to of our issued common shares this authorization was extended by our shareholders at each of our annual meetings beginning in april at our june annual meeting of shareholders we were authorized to cancel of our repurchased shares with a cost of million pursuant to this authorization these shares were cancelled during the second quarter of in addition we were authorized to continue our share repurchase program of up to of our issued common shares through december during the year ended december we repurchased shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of million or an average price of per share subsequent to year end we have repurchased the remaining authorized shares the repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to shareholder authorization we regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to finance future acquisitions however under the dutch commercial code dcc we can only hold a maximum of of our issued shares in treasury therefore it may be necessary to cancel some or all of these shares to remain in compliance with the dcc we believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders our share price has increased from per share in when we began to repurchase shares to per share on december an increase of over in we recorded a net cash inflow of million as a result of our discontinued operations which included million of proceeds from the sale of the specialized geophysical and seismic business and cash received from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit partially offset by a use of operating cash flows credit facilities and available future liquidity on november core laboratories lp a wholly owned subsidiary issued million aggregate principal amount of senior exchangeable notes due notes to qualified institutional buyers the notes bear interest at a rate of per year and are guaranteed by core laboratories nv these notes are exchangeable into shares of core laboratories nv under certain circumstances at an initial conversion rate of per principal amount of notes which is equal to a conversion price of approximately per share upon exchange holders will receive cash up to the principal amount and any excess exchange value will be delivered in core laboratories nv common shares on november the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional million of the senior exchangeable notes due increasing the aggregate issuance of such notes to million we sold the notes to the initial purchasers in reliance on rule a of the secu rities act and subsequently filed a registration statement on form s which became effective immediately pursuant to the securities act with respect to resale of the notes and shares received in exchange for the notes on december the notes bear interest at a rate of per year payable semiannually on may and november of each year beginning on may core laboratories lp used proceeds of the offering to enter into exchangeable note hedge transactions with a financial institution which is an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers the exchangeable note hedge transactions are designed to cover subject to customary anti dilution adjustments the net number of our common shares that would be deliverable to exchanging note holders in the event of an exchange of the notes we paid an aggregate amount of approximately million of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to acquire the call options core laboratories nv also entered into separate warrant transactions at the time of the sale of the notes whereby we sold warrants which give the holders the right to acquire approximately million of our common shares at a strike price of per share upon exercise of the warrants we have the option to deliver cash or our common shares equal to the difference between the then market price and strike price all of the warrants will expire on january we received aggregate proceeds of million from the sale of the warrants which was used to repay our outstanding debt the purchased call options and sold warrants are separate contracts entered into by us with two financial institutions and are not part of the terms of the notes and will not affect the holders rights under the notes the purchased call options are expected to offset the potential dilution upon exchange of the notes in the event that the market value per share of our common shares at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the purchased call options which corresponds to the initial exchange price of the notes and is simultaneously subject to certain customary adjustments the warrants will effectively increase the exchange price of the notes to per share of our common shares from our perspective representing a premium based on the last reported bid price of per share on october in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock and sfas no accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity we recorded the exchangeable note hedge and warrants in capital in excess of par value as of the transaction date and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value we also recognized a deferred tax asset of million in the fourth quarter of for the effect of the future tax benefits related to the exchangeable note hedge we maintain a revolving credit facility the credit facility in november we amended this facility to decrease the aggregate borrowing commitment from million to million and added an option to increase the commitment under the credit facility to million if certain conditions are met the credit facility bears interest at variable rates from libor plus to a maximum of libor plus the credit facility matures in december and requires interest payments only until maturity these interest payments are based on the interest period selected our available borrowing capacity under the credit facility at december was million our available capacity is reduced by outstanding unsecured letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds totaling million at december related to certain projects in progress the terms of the credit facility require us to meet certain financial covenants including but not limited to certain operational and minimum equity and cash flow ratios we believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreement all of our material wholly owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co borrowers under the credit facility in july we issued million in senior notes senior notes which bore interest at an average fixed rate of on december we repurchased all of our outstanding senior notes in accordance with the note and guarantee agreement for face value plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium as prescribed in the senior note agreement such redemption was completed on december and was funded utilizing a combination of excess cash and borrowings under the credit facility the total cash paid in connection with the repurchase was million of which million related to the principal amount of the senior notes million related to the accrued interest and million for a make whole premium which is included in debt prepayment charge in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in addition to our repayment commitments under our credit facilities and the notes we have capital lease obligations related to the purchase of equipment and non cancelable operating lease arrangements under which we lease property including land buildings office equipment and vehicles the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations in thousands long term debt capital leases operating leases pension and other total contractual obligations we anticipate cash payments for interest of million a year for for a total of million our dutch pension plan requires annual employer contributions amounts payable in the future will be based on future workforce factors which cannot be projected beyond one year we have no significant purchase commitments or similar obligations outstanding at december we had tax net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions of approximately million at december if unused those carry forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years through for million of operating loss carry forwards which carried a full valuation allowance expired unused although we cannot assure that these operating loss carry forwards will be utilized we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of december we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately million in in addition we plan to continue to repurchase our common shares on the open market through our stock repurchase program our ability to continue this repurchase program depends on among other things market conditions and our ability to generate free cash flow our ability to maintain and increase our operating income and cash flows is largely dependent upon continued investing activities we believe our future cash flows from operating activities supplemented by our borrowing capacity under existing facilities and our ability to issue additional equity should be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations capital expenditures working capital needs and to finance future acquisitions accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued fasb interpretation no accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no accounting for income taxes fin to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december we will adopt fin as of january as required the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded in retained earnings and other long term liabilities by the end of the first quarter as provided for in fin we expect that the adoption of fin will not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations and our effective income tax rate to vary from period to period as a result of this new guidance forward looking statements this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated in this annual report on form k by reference contain forward looking statements these forward looking statements are based on an analysis of currently available competitive financial and economic data and our operating plans they are inherently uncertain and investors should recognize that events and actual results could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations by way of illustration when used in this document words such as anticipate believe expect intend estimate project will should could may predict and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements you are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements any forward looking statements including statements regarding the intent belief or current expectations of us or our management are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions about us and the industry in which we and core lab operate including among other things our ability to continue to develop or acquire new and useful technology the realization of anticipated synergies from acquired businesses and future acquisitions our dependence on one industry oil and gas and the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our customers competition in the markets we serve the risks and uncertainties attendant to adverse industry political economic and financial market conditions including stock prices government regulations interest rates and credit availability unsettled political conditions war civil unrest currency controls and governmental actions in the numerous countries in which we operate changes in the price of oil and natural gas integration of acquired businesses and the effects of industry
