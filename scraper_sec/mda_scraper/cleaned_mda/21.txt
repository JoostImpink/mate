and dc power distribution units power outlet strips power monitoring equipment and our smart start power management systems our sensors and controls business designs and manufactures rotary and linear precision sensors temperature sensing probes thermistors resistance temperature detector sensors precision accelerometers angular rate gyros and inertial measurement systems and related assemblies we recognize revenue when all significant contractual obligations have been met the sales price is fixed and determinable and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured as a result product sales are generally recorded at the time of shipment when title passes under the terms fob shipping point or ex works payments received from customers in advance of products shipped are recorded as deferred revenue until earned acquisitions on october we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of summit instruments inc summit based in akron ohio summit designs and manufactures custom inertia sensors accelerometers inertial measurement systems and related products and assemblies a majority of summits revenues are generated from militarydefense applications including missile defense systems summit products are also used in numerous commercial applications such as wind turbines industrial test equipment and measurement instrumentation the cash purchase price for summit net of cash received was million which was primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit on june we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of sage laboratories inc sage labs sage labs based in hudson new hampshire designs and manufactures custom rf and microwave products including filters diplexers multiplexers hybrids and digital frequency discriminators a majority of sage labs components and subsystems are used in defense and aerospace applications including missile defense systems electronic warfare military aircraft and radar systems the aggregate cash purchase price for sage labs was million which was primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit on june in a separate transaction we entered into an agreement with drs signal solutions inc drs under which we acquired certain inventories equipment and a fully paid non royalty bearing license to manufacture and sell certain products using intellectual property owned by drs the aggregate cash purchase price for the acquired assets was million which was primarily funded from available cash reserves the acquired assets are expected to be used to support certain specific customer programs over the next six years table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued on november we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of micro networks corporation micro networks a subsidiary of integrated device technology inc nasdaq idti micro networks with operations in worcester massachusetts and auburn new york designs and manufactures high performance data conversion products custom modules and a broad line of filters oscillators and delay lines based on surface acoustic wave saw technology these products and related saw technology are used in numerous defense and aerospace applications the aggregate cash purchase price for micro networks was million which was partially funded by borrowings of million under our domestic line of credit we utilized our existing cash reserves to satisfy the balance of the purchase price this acquisition occurred after the close of business on the last day of our fiscal year and therefore no revenues expenses or customer orders were recognized in our consolidated results of operations or related disclosures for the fiscal year ended november on september we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of satcon electronics inc satcon satcon based in marlborough massachusetts designs and manufactures high performance microelectronic components used in numerous military and commercial applications including secure communication systems and high frequency

management systems sensors and controls compared to net sales our consolidated net sales were million in fiscal an increase of million or from fiscal this sales increase reflects an aggregate impact of million from our recent business acquisitions million from micro networks million from sage labs and from summit the remaining current year increase of million was primarily driven by additional product shipments to numerous commercial customers reflecting a partial rebound from the global recession as well as the impact of several new commercial product offerings sales of our microwave components and systems were million in fiscal an increase of million or from fiscal this increase primarily reflects shipments from our micro networks and sage labs acquisitions of million and million respectively excluding the impact of micro networks and sage labs sales of our microwave products increased by million or from the prior year our microwave components and systems are predominantly used in militarydefense applications including secure communications domestic and international missile defense systems countermeasures for improvised explosive devices electronic warfare and radar systems total customer orders received for this business segment were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal sales of our advanced specialty products were million in fiscal an increase of

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued increased by million from a year ago total customer orders received for this business segment totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal for our sensors and controls sales for fiscal were million an increase of or from a year ago this increase primarily reflects summit shipments of shipments of our sensor products used in numerous industrial applications increased million in fiscal reflecting new product offerings and improved overall market conditions this increase was substantially offset by reduced shipments of our precision position sensors used in certain military vehicles customer orders received for our sensors and controls amounted to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal

average selling prices remained relatively stable in for all of our major product lines gross margin in fiscal our gross margin was million or of sales compared to million or of sales in fiscal the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales principally reflects changes in sales mix and better absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead with higher production volumes total material costs

november we had a total workforce of employees which represents an increase of from the end of last fiscal year the fiscal year end workforce includes employees from the sage labs acquisition and employees from the summit acquisition we expect to continuously review our organization and cost structure to enhance operating efficiencies while maintaining flexibility for additional production requirements selling general and administrative expense in fiscal selling expense amounted to million or of sales compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense as a

our effective income tax rate was in and in compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately for the years ended november and the difference between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate principally reflects state tax provisions and us domestic production activities deductions at november we had recorded certain deferred tax assets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized accordingly no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november compared to net sales our consolidated net sales were million in fiscal an increase of million or from fiscal this increase primarily reflects the impact of twelve months of satcon product sales and increased shipment levels for numerous militarydefense applications offsetting much of this sales growth in fiscal was the global recession and its impact throughout most of our commercial markets sales of our microwave components and systems were million in fiscal an increase of million or from fiscal satcon product shipments increased in fiscal to million up million from fiscal year representing satcons first full year of sales

and results of operations continued liquidity capital resources and financial condition we maintain a domestic line of credit with our principal lending institution pnc bank na of erie pennsylvania the bank in the aggregate amount of million borrowings under the line of credit are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property and bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate the banks revolving credit commitment is scheduled to be permanently reduced in accordance with the following schedule i on december ii on june and iii on december at november million was outstanding under this line of credit arrangement the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness at november we were in compliance with all debt covenants the current line of credit agreement expires in september our ability to borrow in the future under this bank credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future for which there can be no assurance our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains an unsecured euro line of credit with a german financial institution aggregating approximately million euro million at november no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit future borrowings if any will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand in fiscal our net working capital and current ratio increased significantly primarily reflecting reduced borrowings under our domestic line of credit and increased inventories from our recent business acquisitions and additional production requirements at november and net working capital was million and million respectively at november our current assets were times current liabilities compared to at the end of fiscal our net working capital was million at november and our current ratio was to at the end of fiscal in fiscal our working capital and current ratio were negatively impacted by million of net borrowings under our domestic line of credit which were used to fund our cash purchase price for the acquisition of satcon and partially fund our stock repurchase program in fiscal year we expended million for capital additions and improvements of this amount million was for leasehold improvements to a facility in marlborough massachusetts this newly leased facility is being used by our microwave components and systems business to consolidate certain microwave operations as well as increase manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies the remainder of our capital expenditures principally relate to production expansion and improvements particularly for our advanced specialty products business our capital expenditures for property plant and equipment were million in including million in our microwave components and systems business these capital expenditures primarily relate to production capacity and other manufacturing enhancements our capital expenditures for property plant and equipment were million in including million in our microwave components and systems business and million in our advanced specialty products business the balance of our capital expenditures consists of normal replacements and enhancements of manufacturing equipment at november we had not entered into any material commitments for additional capital expenditures we currently expect our aggregate capital expenditures in fiscal to approximate our fiscal levels in october we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of summit the purchase price for summit net of cash received was million in june we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of sage labs the aggregate purchase price for sage labs was million the purchase prices for summit and sage labs were primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit also in june we acquired certain inventories equipment and a fully paid non royalty bearing license to manufacture and sell certain products using intellectual property owned by drs the aggregate purchase price was million which was primarily funded from available cash reserves in november we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of micro networks the aggregate cash purchase price for micro networks was million which was partially funded by borrowings of million under our domestic line of credit we utilized our existing cash reserves to satisfy the balance of the purchase price in september we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of satcon the cash purchase price for satcon was million which was substantially funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit we have adopted a stock repurchase program under this program we may repurchase up to million of the companys outstanding common stock acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the companys capital structure liquidity and the market price of the companys common stock the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock during the years ended november and table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we did not repurchase any of our common stock in we repurchased shares at an aggregate cost of million since the inception of the stock repurchase program shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million research and development expenditures which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes amounted to million in million in and million in we expect to continue our investment in research and development in as we continuously enhance existing product lines design new products and processes and increase our participation in emerging markets income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november and amounted to million million and million respectively as a result of certain temporary differences and prepayments we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be less than income tax expense for fiscal as of november our obligations and firm commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases current financial resources including working capital and existing lines of credit and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year including scheduled long term debt repayment lease commitments planned capital expenditures research and development expenses and possible stock repurchases there can be no assurance however that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and if so required that it will be available on terms acceptable to us net cash provided by operating activities was million in million in and million in this increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects our enhanced profitability and changes in working capital requirements in our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by a million growth in inventories principally reflecting replenishment of ceramic component safety stocks and additional work in process inventories in support of our increased production requirements at november goodwill represented of our total assets and of our stockholders equity in addition to a total of million of goodwill recognized in connection with our recent acquisitions of summit sage labs micro networks and satcon another million of goodwill was realized in earlier acquisitions in accordance with current accounting guidance we have performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of september of each fiscal year and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended november and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in euros british pounds sterling and other local currencies in addition certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos and chinese yuan as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows to manage our exposure to the euro and british pound sterling we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts at november we did not have any forward currency exchange contracts outstanding for each of the three years ended november currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material to the consolidated financial statements interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates from time to time we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions and we have never experienced nonperformance by any counterparties to these agreements at november no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued environmental matters we own certain land and manufacturing facilities in state college pennsylvania the property which was acquired from murata electronics north america murata in december consists of approximately acres of land and square feet of manufacturing facilities among other uses the acquired facilities have become the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic operations replacing the ceramic operations previously conducted in new orleans louisiana the purchase price for the acquired property consisted of a plus b closing costs of including realtor commissions transfer taxes and legal fees plus c the assumption of and indemnification of murata against all environmental liabilities related to the property the acquired property has known environmental conditions that require remediation and certain hazardous materials previously used on the property have migrated into neighboring third party areas these environmental issues arose from the use of chlorinated organic solvents including tetrachloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce as a condition to the purchase we entered into an agreement with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep pursuant to which a we agreed to remediate all known environmental conditions relating to the property to a specified industrial standard with our costs for remediating such conditions being capped at million b padep released murata from further claims by pennsylvania under specified state laws for the known environmental conditions and c we purchased an insurance policy providing clean up cost cap coverage for known and unknown pollutants with a combined coverage limit of approximately million and pollution legal liability coverage for possible third party claims with an aggregate coverage limit of million the total premium cost for the insurance policy which has a ten year term and an aggregate deductible of was million the cost of the insurance associated with the environmental clean up million is being charged to general and administrative expense in direct proportion to the actual remediation costs incurred the cost of the insurance associated with the pollution legal liability coverage million is being charged to general and administrative expense on a pro rata basis over the ten year policy term based upon our environmental review of the property we recorded a liability of million to cover probable future environmental expenditures related to the remediation the cost of which is expected to be entirely covered by the insurance policy as of november remediation expenditures of million have been incurred and charged against the environmental liability with all such expenditures being reimbursed by the insurance carrier the remaining aggregate undiscounted expenditures of which are anticipated to be incurred over the next five years principally consist of a continued operation and monitoring of the existing on site groundwater extraction treatment and recharge system b completion of soil investigations to determine the extent of potential soil contamination c excavation and off site disposal of soil containing contaminates above acceptable standards and d implementation of soil vapor extraction systems in certain areas depending upon the results of future environmental testing and remediation actions it is possible that the ultimate costs incurred could exceed the current aggregate estimate of million we expect such increase if any to be entirely covered by the insurance policy insurance recoveries for actual environmental remediation costs incurred are recorded when it is probable that such insurance reimbursement will be received and the related amounts are determinable such insurance recoveries are credited to the companys general and administrative expense based on the current remediation plan of the total remediation costs are expected to be incurred during the next twelve months we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act and the safe drinking water act we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal agencies various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations as part of our continuing environmental program we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business we are not currently involved in any significant legal proceedings involving environmental matters other legal matters we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of inflation in recent years inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations however we continuously monitor operating price increases particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors and microwave products to the extent permitted by competition we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time sales price increases however were not significant in any of the years presented herein recent accounting pronouncements asc business combinations in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc business combinations the objective of this accounting guidance is to improve the relevance representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects specifically it establishes principles and requirements over how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain price and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination asc changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items including acquisition related costs and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition this accounting guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december the companys fiscal year with early adoption prohibited during the year ended november we incurred acquisition related costs of in connection with three business acquisitions in accordance with the provisions of asc these acquisition related costs were charged to general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income asc intangibles other than goodwill subsequent remeasurements in april the fasb issued asc intangibles other than goodwill subsequent remeasurements which amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset these provisions apply to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of assets and intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions furthermore these provisions remove the provision that requires an entity to consider whether the renewal or extension can be accomplished without substantial cost or material modifications of the existing terms and conditions associated with the asset instead these provisions require that an entity consider its own experience in renewing similar arrangements an entity would consider market participant assumptions regarding renewal if no such relevant experience exists this accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december the companys fiscal year the adoption of this accounting guidance effective december did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended november asc business combinations recognition of identifiable assets and liabilities and any noncontrolling interests in april the fasb issued asc business combinations recognition of identifiable assets and liabilities and any noncontrolling interests which applies to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies that would be within the scope of asc contingencies if not acquired or assumed in a business combination except for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies that are subject to specific guidance in asc business combinations these provisions require an acquirer to recognize at fair value at the acquisition date an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period if the acquisition date fair value cannot be determined during the measurement period the asset or liability shall be recognized at the acquisition date if it is probable that the asset existed or that a liability has been incurred at the acquisition date and the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated these provisions are effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december the companys fiscal year the adoption of this accounting guidance effective december did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the year ended november table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable inventories long lived assets and deferred tax assets we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customers financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due at november our allowance for doubtful accounts was or approximately of our aggregate accounts receivable in determining the adequacy of this allowance we have assumed that conditions in our major served markets militarydefense communications equipment and medicalindustrial instrumentation will not significantly deteriorate during fiscal if current economic and market conditions do significantly deteriorate our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us accordingly our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount at november we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of million for excess and slow moving items in determining the adequacy of these reserves we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage should these forecasts and estimates change due to market technological or other factors the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units which we have identified as our operating segments and is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach in accordance with accounting standards codification asc no intangibles goodwill and other the determination of an impairment requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which we estimate using the discounted cash flow model and market approach the discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions including forecasted operating results and discount rates inherent in the forecasted operating results are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values we perform our goodwill impairment testing as
