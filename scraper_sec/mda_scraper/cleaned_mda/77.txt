companys outstanding indebtedness interest income and other items such as foreign currency exchange gains and losses which may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods the companys ability to grow its net income largely depends upon generating increased sales of its products particularly its higher margin products and further improving its operating efficiency the companys sales growth is driven by its development and marketing of clinically advanced new products and enhancements to its existing products to increase their effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability as well as to expand the clinical applications for which their use is appropriate in this regard the companys research and development efforts are currently focused on the following five core product areas central venous access regional anesthesia cardiac assist dialysis access and hemodynamic monitoring the company also anticipates generating higher sales through selective acquisitions of new businesses products and technologies that complement its existing product lines as it has done from time to time in the past the company is focused on improving operating margins and sales growth by increasing the efficiency and overall capacity of its manufacturing operations and better aligning production facilities with key geographic markets while maintaining effective cost containment programs in this regard in april the company initiated a multi year capital investment plan to increase its worldwide manufacturing capacity to better meet customer demand and rationalize its production operations which entailed the construction and acquisition of additional manufacturing facilities in zdar czech republic and chihuahua mexico which were completed in fiscal production began at the new chihuahua facility in the second quarter of fiscal and at the new zdar facility in august the company has also consolidated certain of its us based manufacturing operations and is improving its production technology by investing in new state of the art manufacturing equipment and processes the installation of which is ongoing and implementing enhanced good

former united kingdom distributor kimal plc associated with the sale of its products in the united kingdom and ireland the company faces substantial competition from a number of other companies in the market for catheters and related medical devices and equipment ranging from small start up enterprises to companies that are larger than arrow with greater financial and other resources in addition in response to concern about the rising costs of health care us hospitals and physicians are placing increasing emphasis on cost effectiveness in the selection of products to perform medical procedures the increased emphasis on health care cost containment has resulted in reduced growth in demand for certain of the companys products in markets in the us in which arrow has a leading market share and protecting that market share has affected the companys pricing in some instances the company also continues to face pricing pressures in certain product lines in both european and japanese markets as governments strive to curtail increases in health care costs despite these pressures the company has been able to retain its position as a leader in the central venous catheter market primarily through concerted efforts to establish and maintain high customer loyalty and a strong recognizable brand name among hospitals and physicians the company believes that its comprehensive manufacturing capability which as described above has been recently expanded enables it to expedite the development and market introduction of new products and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies thereby helping to ensure a more effective response to competitive pricing in an environment where its ability to increase prices is limited managements discussion and analysis mda begins with an examination of the

*not a meaningful comparison fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to an increase in critical care product sales as well as an increase in cardiac care product sales this increase was offset in part by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact during fiscal as a result of the strength of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the company operates direct sales subsidiaries this foreign exchange impact resulted in decreased sales for fiscal of million the following is a summary of the companys sales by product platform sales by product platform in millions for the years ended august august central venous catheters specialty catheters non arrow distributed products subtotal critical care cardiac care total sales of critical care products increased by to million from million in fiscal due primarily to increased sales of central venous catheters and specialty catheters

were approximately million at august which includes a million reserve for potentially unusable inventory gross profit gross profit increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin

for inventory components in excess of months forecasted usage as well as obsolete field service parts consisting of million of critical care product raw materials semi finished and finished goods million of hemosonic components and million of iab inventories which was due primarily to a change in the fourth quarter of fiscal from an order point to a materials requirement planning system and an analysis in greater detail of planned future usage as compared to inventory quantities on hand as a result the company was able to modify its estimates used to account for excess inventory the recording of a provision to cost of sales of million in the second quarter of fiscal for inventory and manufacturing equipment related to the companys lionheart left ventricular assist system lvas as

ireland following the companys purchase of certain assets of kimal its former distributor in the united kingdom region in april as further discussed below under liquidity and capital resources investing activities these positive impacts on margin relative to the prior fiscal year were offset in part by a million reduction in depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal for a correction of fixed asset lives related to manufacturing equipment in the companys non us facilities as those lives were shorter than those prescribed by the companys policy lower margins realized in fiscal on the sale of products acquired as part of the companys purchase of certain assets of kimal in april and higher manufacturing costs recognized in fiscal associated with short term inefficiencies and the training of new employees in connection with the companys manufacturing capital investment program research and development research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease in research and development spending was due primarily to decreased spending in fiscal on the companys cardiac care product line mostly attributable to the fact that there were no research and development expenses in fiscal relating to the companys lionheart lvas as a result of its board of directors decision to discontinue the development sales and marketing programs related to the lionheart during the third quarter of fiscal whereas there was million of lionheart related spending in fiscal offsetting this decrease was

to the intangible assets included as part of the kimal acquisition million related to the companys retired officers life insurance policies and million related to legal costs associated with the

before income taxes increased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal effective tax rate the companys effective income tax rate in fiscal increased to from in fiscal due primarily to a reduction in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from a shift in the mix of earnings to the czech republic which carries a lower tax rate due to a tax holiday effective through august as further discussed below more favorable fiscal research and development tax credits the completion of an intercompany intangible transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the companys european operations and a million increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal to the income tax provision to provide for deferred taxes related to temporary differences that will reverse

signed the american jobs creation act of the act the act included some of the most significant changes to corporate taxation since and among other things eliminates the extra territorial income eti exclusion deduction a tax incentive that benefits us companies to manufacture export products domestically over a three year phase out period beginning in however the phase out allowed the company to

calculation of the overall effect of these changes management believes that the phased out repeal of the eti benefit during and and the phase in of the new manufacturing deduction benefit from to

republic tax holiday during fiscal the companys effective income tax continued to reflect a benefit from a tax holiday in respect of the companys czech republic operations this tax holiday was in

days the company has concluded that the government of italy typically delays payments to its government backed hospitals which in turn has impacted the companys overall days sales outstanding the italian government backed hospitals have historically paid customers of their outstanding receivables as a result the company currently believes that the ultimate collectibility of these receivables net of discounts is not a significant risk however because the companys assessment of this situation is based in part on political factors beyond its control the company cannot assure that all of these receivables will be collected or when they will be collected and will continue to evaluate their collectibility and establish reserves when and to the extent necessary as of august the company had recorded an allowance of million to reserve for specifically identified potentially uncollectible private italian customer balances the company currently evaluates all of its trade receivables on

quarter of fiscal the company incurred million of costs related to this program in fiscal all of these costs in both fiscal and have been recorded as selling general and administrative expenses financing activities financing activities provided million of net cash in fiscal compared to using million in fiscal primarily as a result of the companys increased borrowing under its revolving credit facilities and in particular its czech republic credit facility used to help finance the construction of its new manufacturing facility in zdar czech republic cash provided by financing activities however was reduced by an increase in dividend payments following the companys increase in the amount of its quarterly dividend during the second quarter of each of fiscal and and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises credit facilities to provide additional liquidity and flexibility in funding its operations the company from time to time also borrows amounts under credit facilities and other external sources of financing at august and the company had a revolving credit facility providing a total of million and million respectively in available revolving credit for general business purposes of which million and million was outstanding respectively all of which is owed by its foreign subsidiaries the increase in the available credit under this credit facility was effected in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily to provide increased funding for the construction of the companys zdar czech republic manufacturing facility at august million of such outstanding indebtedness related to the companys czech republic subsidiary as discussed above under this credit facility the company is required to comply with certain financial covenants at august and the company was in compliance with all such covenants failure to remain in compliance with these covenants could trigger an acceleration of the companys obligation to repay all outstanding borrowings under this credit facility the company currently anticipates that the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no during fiscal will not have a material impact on its compliance with any of these debt covenants the company is currently considering refinancing some of its borrowings under this credit facility with longer term fixed rate debt certain other subsidiaries of the company had revolving credit facilities totaling the us dollar equivalent of and million of which and million were outstanding as of august and respectively interest rate terms for both us and foreign bank credit facilities are based on either bids provided by the lender london interbank offered rates libor or tokyo interbank offered rates tibor plus applicable margins interest

above outlook based upon its present plans the company believes that cash generated from its operations and available credit resources including its ability to extend maturities of borrowings outstanding under its lines of credit in the ordinary course consistent with past practice will be adequate to repay current portions of long term debt to finance currently planned capital expenditures including those remaining pursuant to the companys multi year capital investment plan and other initiatives related to its project operational excellence as discussed above and to meet the currently foreseeable liquidity needs of the company critical accounting policies and estimates the company has disclosed in note to its consolidated financial statements included in item of this report those accounting policies that it considers to be significant in determining its results of operations and financial position in all material respects the accounting principles utilized by the company in preparing its consolidated financial statements are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements the company bases its estimates on historical experience actuarial valuations and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions while for any given estimate or assumption made by the companys management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable the company believes that given the current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements the companys management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and pervasive accounting policies used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized by the company based upon estimates of the time its products are delivered and title and risk of loss has passed to its customer the companys net sales represent gross sales invoiced to customers less certain related charges including discounts returns rebates and other allowances such charges are recognized against revenue on an accrual basis the company offers sales discounts to certain customers based on prior experience with these customers business needs and regional competition product returns are permitted the accrual for product returns is based on the companys history of actual product returns historically product returns have not been material the companys practice is to credit or replace lost or damaged shipments the company grants sales rebates to certain distributors upon achievement of agreed upon pricing for sales of the companys products to hospitals incurred but unpaid rebates are accrued by the company in the period in which they are incurred the companys rebate accrual is based on its history of actual rebates paid the companys reserves for rebates are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance is used to state trade receivables at estimated net realizable value the company relies on prior payment trends while giving consideration to other criteria such as political risk financial status and other factors to estimate the cash which ultimately will be received such amounts cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date the company regularly reviews individual past due balances over days and over a specific amount for collectibility and maintains a specific allowance for customer accounts that will likely not be collectible the company also maintains an allowance for estimated future collection losses on existing receivables determined based on historical trends inventory the company uses a standard cost system and cost is determined by the first in first out fifo method this standard cost system uses estimates of overhead absorption direct labor hours production volumes and yields the company uses a materials management program for identifying redeploying and or destroying slow moving inactive or potentially obsolete inventory an adjustment to net realizable value is recorded for all inventory specifically identified as slow moving inactive or potentially obsolete based on a quarterly assessment performed by the companys management during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company changed from an order point to a materials requirement planning system and compared in greater detail planned future usage to inventory quantities on hand and as a result was able to modify its estimates used to account for excess inventory as a result of this modification of its estimates the company recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal a million reserve primarily for inventory components in excess of months forecasted usage as well as obsolete field service parts consisting of million of critical care raw materials semi finished and finished goods million of hemosonic components and million of iab inventories inventory in excess of months of forecasted usage may be used in the future if production requirements increase for certain new products the company manufactures inventory in anticipation of product launch as of august the company had million of inventory related to its hemosonictm hemodynamic monitoring devices the company is currently developing improvements to this product that it believes should enhance the demand for this product in the marketplace the companys inventory is evaluated on an ongoing basis and is adjusted as necessary to accurately reflect current conditions product liability the company provides reserves for product liability by utilizing loss estimates prepared by the primary product liability insurance carrier with adjustments as appropriate based upon managements perspective on the ultimate projected claim giving consideration to the perspective of outside counsel and other relevant factors the companys evaluation of its reserve is based on industry standards while taking into consideration the companys specific claims experience the company records a reserve regarding a particular claim when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated a reserve is not recorded the companys primary global product liability insurance policy is on a claims made basis employee benefit plans the company uses several actuarial and other statistical factors which attempt to anticipate future events in calculating its expense and liability related to these plans these factors include assumptions about discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company within specified guidelines in addition the companys actuarial consultants also utilize subjective assumptions such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences depending on their magnitude could have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company in any particular period net periodic pension cost is recorded in operating expenses in amounts determined by the companys actuaries and is based on managements estimates of expected interest rates expected rates of return on plan assets and expected compensation increases these estimates reflect managements best judgments in the current circumstances actual results may differ from the estimates interest rate assumptions are based on market rates at the beginning of the companys fiscal year expected rates of return on plan assets are based in part on the companys historical asset portfolio performance over the prior ten year period and also on the estimated rate of return on plan assets in the future the companys rate of compensation increase assumption is based on its historical compensation percentage increases as well as its expected rate increases in future periods income taxes the companys effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of research and development tax credits deductions associated with the extraterritorial income tax regimesection deduction and a tax holiday in the czech republic because the company operates in a number of domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions the statutory rates within these various jurisdictions are considered in determining the companys overall effective tax rate managements judgment is required to determine the companys consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax balances and any valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets the companys management also considers open statutory periods current and anticipated audits and the impact that any adverse adjustments would have on the companys current and prospective overall effective tax rate the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and has not established valuation allowances the company deems all undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries permanently invested and accordingly has not established a tax provision for any repatriation of retained earnings in these entities new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no chapter in november this statement amends the guidance in arb no chapter inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material sfas no requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal in addition this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no effective september the impact of this statement on the companys consolidated financial statements was not material to its results of operations for fiscal the fasb issued sfas no r share based payment an amendment of sfas no and in december this statement requires that the cost of all forms of equity based compensation granted to employees excluding employee stock ownership plans be recognized in a companys income statement and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the stock options this statement replaces the guidance in sfas no accounting for stock based compensation and apb no accounting for stock issued to employees in addition the sec issued sab no share based payment in march which provides supplemental sfas no r guidance based on the views of the sec the company adopted the provisions of sfas no r effective september using the modified prospective method the adoption of this statement resulted in a charge of million in fiscal to income from continuing operations and income before income taxes of which million was recorded to cost of sales million to research and development and million to selling general and administrative expenses these charges impacted net income by million or basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal the tax benefit from this stock option expense is less than the statutory tax benefit because sfas no r precludes the company from recognizing a tax benefit on future disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options until these dispositions occur the fasb issued fasb interpretation accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no fin in july the intent of fin is to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with sfas no this interpretation imposes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december the company is currently evaluating the requirements of fin and has not yet determined the impact this adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements the fasb issued sfas no employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of sfas no and r in september this statement requires that an employer recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income this statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end the provisions of sfas no will be effective for fiscal years ending after december the company currently estimates that the adoption of this statement will result in a charge of approximately million to other comprehensive expense as of august the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no in september to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements sab no requires companies to quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of their financial statements and related disclosures sab no is effective for fiscal years ending after november allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for errors that were not previously deemed material but are material under the guidance in sab no the company currently believes that this statement will not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk due to the global nature of its operations the company is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations such exposures arise from transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily from translation into us dollars from foreign currencies of results of operations from outside the united states intercompany loans and intercompany purchases of inventory the company is also exposed to interest rate changes the companys objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenues to meet these objectives the contracts involve japanese yen and other foreign currencies the gains and losses on these contracts are offset by changes in the value of the related exposures in the companys income statement it is the companys policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent exposures exist and not to enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes the fair value of all the companys foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august was million the following analysis estimates the sensitivity of the fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts to hypothetical favorable and unfavorable changes in spot exchange rates at august and fair value of foreign currency forward contracts in millions august august adverse rate movement at august st rates favorable rate movement the company had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding at august and any gains and losses on the fair value of forward and option contracts would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transactions or anticipated transactions during fiscal and the percentage of the companys sales invoiced in currencies other than us dollars was and respectively in addition a part of the companys cost of goods sold is denominated in foreign currencies the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts which are derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions to reduce the effect of these foreign currency risk exposures primarily on us dollar cash inflows resulting from the collection of intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge anticipated sales in foreign currencies to foreign subsidiaries such transactions occur throughout the year and are probable but not firmly committed foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in other income expense of the companys consolidated statements of income realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by changes in the us dollar value of the foreign denominated assets liabilities and transactions being hedged the premiums paid on the foreign currency option contracts are recorded as assets and amortized over the life of the option other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties the companys maximum exposure related to foreign currency options is limited to the premiums paid the total premiums authorized to be paid in any fiscal year cannot exceed million pursuant to the terms of the foreign currency management policy statement approved by the companys board of directors in fiscal gains and losses on purchased option contracts result from changes in intrinsic or time value both time value and intrinsic value gains and losses are recorded in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income until the period in which the underlying sale by the foreign subsidiary to an unrelated third party is recognized at which point those deferred gains and losses are recognized in net sales by their nature all such contracts involve risk including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties accordingly losses relating to these contracts could have a material adverse effect upon the companys business financial condition and results of operations based upon the companys knowledge of the financial condition of the counterparties to its existing foreign currency forward contracts the company believes that it does not have any material exposure to any individual counterparty the companys policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october outstanding foreign currency forward contracts totaling the us dollar equivalent of million mature at various dates through june as of october the company had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding the company expects to continue to utilize foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts to manage its exposure although there can be no assurance that the companys efforts in this regard will be successful the companys exposure to credit risk consists principally of trade receivables hospitals and international dealers account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required the risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the companys ongoing credit review procedures additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk eg interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk are set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report
