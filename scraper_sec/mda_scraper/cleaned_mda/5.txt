inflation has not had a significant effect on the companys results of operations during or in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of oil and gas on the companys operations management has adopted a policy of hedging oil and gas prices usually when such prices are at or in excess of the prices anticipated in the companys operating budget through the use of commodity futures options forward contracts and swap agreements hedging transactions are limited by the board of directors such that no transaction may fix an oil and gas price for a term of more than months
