storage broadcasting hosting and related functions to vitalstream and its partners our business model leverages our expertise experience and resources in audio and video streaming as well as our integrated hosting technology to persuade customers to utilize our internet content delivery services our revenues primarily consist of monthly recurring revenues from contracts with terms of generally one year or more these contracts usually have a fixed minimum commitment based on a certain level of usage with additional charges for any usage over the minimum commitment level this monthly recurring revenue model allows us to build a base of consistent and predictable revenue streams our success depends on our ability to retain our current customers and at the same time growing this base by adding new customers with similar monthly recurring revenue arrangements and by increasing sales of additional products and services to our customers table of contents in we continued to position our company to increase revenue and market share and to take advantage of the demand and growth opportunities within the streaming media market in addition to increasing our sales and marketing efforts we invested heavily in our content delivery network to increase scalability and capacity to allow us to handle greater revenue growth we also continued to supplement and enhance our portfolio of products and services in we will continue to focus on driving growth in our revenue base but we expect that these investments in our content delivery network our product portfolio and our sales and marketing efforts will be increasingly offset by increases in volume purchasing gains greater operational efficiencies and tight cost controls as we strive to be cash flow positive in the following are events and trends that will likely affect our financial condition and results of operations in l revenue grew by in compared to we expect that favorable trends in broadband adoption internet streaming usage internet advertising spending and rich and streaming media spending will continue to drive growth in our revenue base l depreciation expense in was million higher than in during the back half of we spent over million to further strengthen our content delivery network infrastructure by upgrading our current storage architecture with a storage area network san solution and adding an additional servers distributed across our multiple data centers we intend to continue to invest in our content delivery network as necessary as a result of the above and primarily due to the higher depreciation level beginning in the fourth quarter of depreciation will likely be higher in l although our total bandwidth cost increased during compared to we were able to reduce our bandwidth cost per unit during as a result of favorably renegotiating certain bandwidth contracts and higher volume purchasing leverage in we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of increasing usage levels but will be partially offset by continued decreases in our bandwidth cost per unit l in april and effective as of april vitalstream acquired the business of playstream llc a leading provider of small business streaming media services headquartered in seattle washington the acquisition augmented our services and customer base allowing us to offer an affordable self service platform suited for small and medium size businesses smb and small and home office soho customers and resellers the deal was valued at in cash million shares of

we pay off theseloans outstanding with comerica earlier than scheduled interest expense and income during will be affected accordingly l section of the sarbanes oxley act of applies to all public companies under section public companies are required to design establish and maintain an adequate system of internal financial and disclosure controls assess such controls as of the end of each fiscal year and engage an independent accounting firm to evaluate and provide an opinion on managements assessment of their controls on march the securities and exchange commission sec postponed by one year the date of effectiveness for compliance with the assessment and auditing requirements of section for non accelerated filers such as the company until the end of fiscal we expect to be required to comply with section assessment reporting and auditing requirements for fiscal and expect to incur additional costs in for the costs of the audit and achieving compliance l statement of financial accounting standards or sfas r became effective january under sfas r we are required to record a deferred compensation expense for employee equity grants at the fair value at the time of grant the deferred compensation calculated under a fair value method would then be amortized over the respective vesting period of the equity grant and will be included in results of operations we expect this expense to be significant in and in the future as a result of this new requirement as we have a large number of unvested employee options outstanding and plan to continue to grant equity based compensation in the future l on february we closed a financing transaction with institutional investors by issuing shares of common stock at a price of per share generating gross proceeds to the company of million net proceeds from this transaction will be used for general corporate purposes including network and infrastructure expenditures supporting domestic and international growth and funding ongoing product development table of contents while the opportunities for us are increasing they are not without risk our business and our industry face numerous risks see item a risk factors only some of which can be mitigated to varying degrees in advance and others of which can only be dealt with reactively if at all as with any technology company new technological advances within our industry could cause a paradigm shift in how we develop market and deliver our products and services or how users perceive and use them some of these advances may be unavailable to us and we may not have a comparable or competitive technological offering the upward trend in sales growth combined with operational efficiencies creates an opportunity for us to become profitable in the future however there can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable in the future or on a sustained basis critical accounting policies and estimates management is basing this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an on going basis we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates including those related to revenue recognition valuation of accounts receivable property plant and equipment long lived assets intangible assets and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amount of our revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods changes to these judgments and estimates could materially affect the companys future results of operations and cash flows l valuation of accounts receivable a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of our customers significant portions of customer payments are made by credit card and electronic debit each month management reviews historical charge back and cancellation patterns as well as historical data on other credits issued to customers and then records an allowance based on historical results as well as management judgment additionally each month management reviews the aged receivables balance and records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the age of the outstanding receivable balances trends in outstanding balances and managements judgment as a result of these analyses we believe that the current allowance is adequate to cover any bad debts and credits that may be issued as of the date of the balance sheet if our estimates prove t o be wrong however and we have not accrued enough of a reserve to cover the bad debts and credits we would have to accrue additional reserve in later periods to cover the shortfall if the under accrual were substantial this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results on the other hand if we have reserved too much we may be able to lower our accrual in later periods which would have a positive effect on our financial results l goodwill goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is subject to impairment tests at least annually accordingly we annually evaluate goodwill for potential impairment indicators if impairment indicators exist we measure the impairment through the use of discounted cash flows our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors market conditions and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the goodwill associated with our acquired business is impaired if we subsequently determine that an impairment was or is required we may be required to write down all or part of our goodwill this would both reduce the amount of our assets which may affect our ability to qualify for listing or continued listing on a stock exchange and would reduce the amount of our net income or increase the amount of our net loss for the quarter and year in which the impairment was recogni zed depending on the size of the write down the adverse impact on our financial results could be material table of contents l contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of loss accrual required if any for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary to assess any contingencies a required accrual may change at some point in the future due to new developments in a matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters if our judgment proves to be wrong concerning a possible accrual or other contingency the impact on our results of operations and cash flows could be material if we have under accrued for a material liability we would have to increase our accrual for later period which could materially decrease our net income or incr ease or net loss for such period the payment of any material contingent liability would also adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity table of contents results of operations

from for the year ended december to for the year ended december the increased cost in absolute dollars primarily reflects an increase in depreciation licensing fees and bandwidth while the increased

significant investment in our content delivery network during the back half of to increase scalability and capacity software license fees increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales due to higher growth in streaming sales bandwidth costs increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of revenues due to economies of scale realized from our increasing purchasing volume and additional decreases in bandwidth prices effective january our per unit license fees were reduced as a result of favorable pricing through increased purchasing volume from higher streaming sales we also expect per unit bandwidth costs to decrease over as we increase efficiencies in distributing bandwidth among our carriers and we achieve more favorable pricing through greater bandwidth purchasing volume as such excluding stock based compensation expense during the first quarter of we expect the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to increase compared to full year as increases in depreciation from increased capital expenditures to increase the capacity and scalability of our content delivery network in the back half of and the effect of expensing employee stock options under sfas r in are only partially offset by economies of scale in our relatively fixed cost base such as our internet backbone network operations employee costs and data center facility costs over

net interest expense net interest expense decreased from for the year ended december to for the year ended december the decrease was primarily due to the impact in of one time payments of approximately of interest and premiums associated with the conversion of million in amended and restated convertible promissory notes the convertible notes and all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock into common stock during the second quarter of excluding this transaction net interest expense was roughly comparable at approximately in compared to in we expect net interest expense
