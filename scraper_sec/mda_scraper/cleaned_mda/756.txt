item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period the statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties the actual results of the future events described in such forward looking statements in this annual report could differ materially from those stated in such forward looking statements among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in this item under factors that may affect future results and the market price of common stock on page and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in our other public reports and filings and public statements overview we provide a comprehensive personnel management system that encompasses a broad range of services including benefits and payroll administration health and workers compensation insurance programs personnel records management employer liability management employee recruiting and selection employee performance management and employee training and development services our long term strategy continues to be aggregating the best small businesses in the united states on the common platform of our unique human resource service offering thereby leveraging our buying power to provide additional valuable services to clients our overall operating results can be measured in terms of revenues payroll costs gross profit or operating income per worksite employee per month we often use the number of worksite employees paid as our unit of measurement in analyzing and discussing our results of operations our key objective for was to continue to accelerate the growth in the number of paid worksite employees while appropriately pricing our service offering we ended averaging paid worksite employees in the fourth quarter which represents a increase over the fourth quarter of our average number of worksite employees paid for the full year increased over these increases were driven by improvements in sales and the net change in existing clients our average gross profit per worksite employee per month of reflected the effective execution of our pricing strategy including a slight increase in the markup related to our hr services while managing our direct costs to better than expected levels lower than expected direct costs particularly benefits costs and workers compensation costs were primarily a result of the favorable trends in claims experience complemented by lower administrative fees negotiated with our insurance carriers benefits costs per participant increased over while workers compensation costs as a percentage of non bonus payroll declined by operating expenses increased by in to million on a increase in the number of worksite employees paid operating expenses increased due primarily to investments in sales and service personnel for the current and future growth of our business on a per worksite employee per month basis operating expenses increased from in to in our net income increased to million in over we ended with working capital of million which is a million increase from the end of revenues we account for our revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent our gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each worksite employee at the client location and a markup computed as a percentage of each worksite employees payroll cost we invoice the gross billings concurrently with each periodic payroll of our worksite employees revenues which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings and therefore consist solely of the markup are recognized ratably over the payroll period as worksite employees perform their service at the client worksite table of contents this markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll taxes benefits and workers compensation costs plus a separate component related to our hr services we include revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced in unbilled accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets our revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled the resulting number of worksite employees paid each period and the number of worksite employees enrolled in our benefit plans because our markup is computed as a percentage of payroll cost revenues are also affected by the payroll cost of worksite employees which may fluctuate based on the composition of the worksite employee base inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies of our markets direct costs the primary direct costs associated with our revenue generating activities are employment related taxes payroll taxes costs of employee benefit plans and workers compensation costs payroll taxes consist of the employers portion of social security and medicare taxes under fica federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost the federal tax rates are defined by federal regulations state unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories and vary from state to state employee benefits costs are comprised primarily of health insurance costs including dental and pharmacy costs but also include costs of other employee benefits such as life insurance vision care disability insurance education assistance adoption assistance a flexible spending account and a worklife program workers compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier and claims costs which are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims gross profit our gross profit per worksite employee is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to clients which are subject to contractual arrangements that are typically renewed annually we use gross profit per worksite employee per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level operating expenses salaries wages and payroll taxes salaries wages and payroll taxes are primarily a function of the number of corporate employees and their associated average pay and any additional incentive compensation our corporate employees include client services sales and marketing benefits legal finance information technology and administrative support personnel stock based compensation our stock based compensation primarily relates to the recognition of non cash compensation expense over the vesting period of restricted stock awards in the non cash expenses associated with the acceleration of stock option vesting were also included table of contents general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses primarily include rent expenses related to our service centers and sales offices outside professional service fees related to legal consulting and accounting services administrative costs such as postage printing and supplies employee travel expenses and repairs and maintenance costs associated with our facilities and technology infrastructure commissions commission expense consists of amounts paid to sales personnel commissions for sales personnel are based on a percentage of revenue generated by such personnel advertising advertising expense primarily consists of media advertising and other business promotions in our current and anticipated sales markets including the administaff small business classic sponsorship depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense is primarily a function of our capital investments in corporate facilities service centers sales offices and technology infrastructure income taxes administaffs provision for income taxes typically differs from the us statutory rate of due primarily to state income taxes and non deductible expenses deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include prepaid assets accruals for workers compensation expenses and depreciation changes in these items are reflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision critical accounting policies and estimates administaffs discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates including those related to health and workers compensation insurance claims experience state unemployment and payroll taxes client bad debts income taxes property and equipment goodwill and other intangibles and contingent liabilities we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following accounting policies are critical and or require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements benefits costs we provide group health insurance coverage to our worksite employees through a national network of carriers including unitedhealthcare united cigna healthcare pacificare kaiser permanente blue cross and blue shield of georgia blue shield of california hawaii medical service association and tufts all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts the policy with united which was first obtained in january provides the majority of our health insurance coverage as a result of certain contractual terms we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self funded insurance accounting model accordingly we record the costs of the united plan including an estimate of the incurred claims taxes and administrative fees collectively the plan costs as benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations the estimated incurred claims are based upon i the level of claims processed during the quarter ii recent claim development patterns under the plan to estimate a completion rate and iii the number of participants in the plan each reporting period changes in table of contents the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends plan design and migration participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs additionally since the plans inception in january under the terms of the contract united establishes cash funding rates days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter if the plan costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the cash funded to united a deficit in the plan would be incurred and we would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our consolidated balance sheet on the other hand if the plan costs for the reporting quarter are less than the cash funded to united a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums on our consolidated balance sheet the terms of the arrangement require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of million which is reported as long term prepaid insurance as of december plan costs were less than the net cash funded to united by million as this amount is in excess of the agreed upon million surplus maintenance level the million balance is included in prepaid insurance a current asset on our consolidated balance sheet we believe the use of recent claims activity is representative of incurred and paid trends during the reporting period the estimated completion rate used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a significant level of judgment accordingly an increase or decrease in the completion rates used to estimate the incurred claims would result in a decrease or increase in benefits costs and net income would increase or decrease accordingly the following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rates on our estimate of total benefit costs of million in change in change in change in benefits costs net income completion rate in thousands in thousands state unemployment taxes we record our state unemployment sui tax expense based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state state unemployment tax rates vary by state and are determined in part based on prior years compensation experience in each state prior to the receipt of final tax rate notices we estimate our expected sui tax rate in those states for which tax rate notices have not yet been received in december as a result of a corporate reorganization we filed for a transfer of our reserve account with the employment development department of the state of california edd the edd approved our request for transfer of our reserve account in may and notified us of our new contribution rates based upon the approved transfer in december we received a notice of duplicate accounts and notification of assessment notice from the edd the notice stated that the edd was collapsing the accounts of administaffs subsidiaries into the account of the entity with the highest unemployment tax rate the notice also retroactively imposed the higher unemployment insurance rate on all our california employees for resulting in an assessment of million in january we filed a petition with an administrative law judge of the california unemployment insurance appeals board alj to protest the validity of the notice pending a resolution of our protest in the fourth quarter of we accrued and recorded at the higher assessed rate for all of in june we agreed to settle our dispute with the edd for million settlement based upon receipt of written acknowledgement of this agreement we reduced our accrued payroll tax liability and payroll tax expense by million during the quarter ended june the settlement was subject to the final approval by edds legal department the california attorney generals office and the alj in october the legal department of the edd verbally indicated they considered the previously agreed upon settlement amount to be insufficient and suggested a settlement amount of million we continued discussions with the table of contents state of california but in february we were notified that the edd had rejected our settlement offer and the matter proceeded with the appeals process with the alj as of october all of the statutes of limitations concerning notices to modify unemployment tax rates for the periods addressed in the notice had expired we believe the edd failed to meet the statutory requirement related to serving a proper notice within the stipulated time frame therefore we believe it is no longer probable that the amount accrued for the california unemployment tax matter will be incurred accordingly we reduced the state unemployment tax accrual by million during workers compensation costs our workers compensation coverage the aig program is currently provided through selected member insurance companies of american international group inc aig under our arrangement with aig we bear the economic burden for the first million layer of claims per occurrence aig bears the economic burden for all claims in excess of such first million layer the aig program is a fully insured policy whereby aig has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities because we bear the economic burden of the first million layer of claims per occurrence such claims which are the primary component of our workers compensation costs are recorded in the period incurred workers compensation insurance includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury accordingly the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment our management estimates our workers compensation costs by applying an aggregate loss development rate to worksite employee payroll levels we employ a third party actuary to estimate our loss development rate which is primarily based upon the nature of worksite employees job responsibilities the location of worksite employees the historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends each reporting period changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into the companys workers compensation claims cost estimates during the years ended december and administaff reduced accrued workers compensation costs by million and million respectively for changes in estimated losses and tax surcharges related to prior reporting periods workers compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the us treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period the average discount rate utilized in and was and respectively and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our consolidated statements of operations our claim trends could be greater than or less than our prior estimates in which case we would revise our claims estimates and record an adjustment to workers compensation costs in the period such determination is made if we were to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions our loss development rates could increase or decrease which would result in an increase or decrease in workers compensation costs and a resulting decrease or increase in net income reported in our consolidated statement of operations the following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers compensation costs totaling million in change in workers change in change in loss compensation costs net income development rate in thousands in thousands at the beginning of each policy period the insurance carrier aig establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims claim funds the level table of contents of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and expected workers compensation loss rates as determined by aig monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one year are recorded as restricted cash a short term asset while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits a long term asset in our consolidated balance sheets our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year are recorded as accrued workers compensation costs and included in short term liabilities while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year are included in long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december we had restricted cash of million and deposits of million we have estimated and accrued million in incurred workers compensation claim costs as of december contingent liabilities we accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no accounting for contingencies sfas no requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered probable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated for contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably possible to occur financial statement disclosure is required including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably determined we have disclosed in our audited financial statements several issues that we believe are reasonably possible to occur although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases see note to our consolidated financial statements as these issues develop we will continue to evaluate the probability of future loss and the potential range of such losses if such evaluation were to determine that a loss was probable and the loss could be reasonably estimated we would be required to accrue our estimated loss which would reduce net income in the period that such determination was made deferred taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could change from our current estimates if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period that such determination is made likewise should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would reduce net income in the period such determination is made allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their comprehensive service fees we believe that the success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to collect these comprehensive service fees for several reasons including the fact that we are at risk for the payment of our direct costs and worksite employee payroll costs regardless of whether our clients pay their comprehensive service fees the large volume and dollar amount of transactions we process and the periodic and recurring nature of payroll upon which the comprehensive service fees are based to mitigate this risk we have established very tight credit policies we generally require our clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than one day prior to the applicable payroll date in addition we maintain the right to terminate the client service agreement and associated worksite employees or to require prepayment letters of credit or other collateral if a clients financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the comprehensive service fee as a result of these efforts losses related to customer nonpayment have historically been low as a percentage of revenues however if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate rapidly resulting in nonpayment our accounts receivable balances could grow and we could be required to provide for additional allowances which would decrease net income in the period that such determination was made table of contents property and equipment our property and equipment relate primarily to our facilities and related improvements furniture and fixtures computer hardware and software and capitalized software development costs these costs are depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets if we determine that the useful lives of these assets will be shorter than we currently estimate our depreciation and amortization expense could be accelerated which would decrease net income in the periods of such a determination in addition we periodically evaluate these costs for impairment in accordance with sfas no accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets if events or circumstances were to indicate that any of our long lived assets might be impaired we would analyze the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the applicable asset in addition we would record an impairment loss which would reduce net income to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeded the fair value of the asset fair value is generally determined using an estimate of discounted future net cash flows from operating activities or upon disposal of the asset goodwill and other intangibles the december acquisition of hrtoolscom and associated software applications included certain identifiable intangible assets and goodwill implied in the purchase price the goodwill and intangible assets are subject to the provisions of sfas no goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in accordance with sfas goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and written down when impaired furthermore sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite our purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets five to ten years new accounting pronouncements in july the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin an interpretation of fasb statement no accounting for income taxes fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective date for the

and repaying debt we rely primarily on cash from operations however we have in the past sought and may in the future seek to raise additional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources we had million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december of which approximately million was payable in early january for withheld federal and state income taxes employment taxes and other payroll deductions at december we had working capital of million compared to million at december we currently believe that our cash on hand marketable securities and cash flows table of contents from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for we will rely on these same sources as well as public and private debt or equity financing to meet our longer term liquidity and capital needs cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities in of million reflected a decrease of million from our primary source of cash from operations is the comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our clients the level of cash and cash equivalents and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities are significantly impacted by various external and internal factors which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts these include the following timing of customer payments payrolls we typically collect our comprehensive service fee along with the clients payroll funding from clients at least one day prior to the payment of worksite employee payrolls and associated payroll taxes therefore the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of operating cash flows for example many worksite employees are paid on fridays therefore operating cash flows decline in the reporting periods that end on a friday such as december when client prepayments were million and accrued worksite employee payroll was million however for those reporting periods that end on a thursday our cash flows are higher due to the collection of the comprehensive service fee and clients payroll funding prior to processing the large number worksite employees payrolls one day subsequent to the period end classification of tax benefit from stock based compensation in we adopted statement r which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized as a compensation cost in addition statement r requires the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation to be reported as a financing activity in the consolidated

with united establishes participant cash funding rates days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter therefore changes in the participation level of the united plan have a direct impact on our operating cash flows in addition changes to the funding rates which are solely determined by united based primarily upon recent claim history and anticipated cost trends also have a significant impact on our operating cash flows since inception of the united plan in january cash funded to united has exceeded plan costs resulting in a million surplus million of which is reflected as a current asset and million of which is reflected as a long term asset on our consolidated balance sheets at december additionally the million in long term deposits was returned to administaff during workers compensation plan funding under our arrangement with aig we make monthly payments to aig comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims claim funds these pre determined amounts are stipulated in our agreement with aig and are based primarily on anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers compensation loss rates during the policy year changes

employee payroll and benefits costs under the csa we become a co employer of worksite employees and assume the obligations to pay the salaries wages and related benefits costs and payroll taxes of such worksite employees we assume such obligations as a principal not as an agent of the client our obligations include responsibility for payment of the salaries and wages for work performed by worksite employees regardless of whether the client timely pays us the associated service fee and providing benefits to worksite employees even if our costs to provide such benefits exceed the fees the client pays us if a client does not pay us or if the costs of benefits we provide to worksite employees exceed the fees a client pays us our ultimate liability for worksite employee payroll and benefits costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations increases in health insurance premiums maintaining health insurance plans that cover worksite employees is a significant part of our business our primary health insurance contract expires on december and automatically renews each year subject to cancellation by either party upon days notice health insurance premiums are in part determined by our claims experience and comprise a significant portion of our direct costs we employ extensive risk management procedures in an attempt to control our claims incidence and structure our benefits contracts to provide as much cost stability as possible however if we experience a sudden and unexpected large increase in claim activity our health insurance costs could increase contractual arrangements with our clients limit our ability to incorporate such increases into service fees which could result in a delay before such increases could be

september lumbermens mutual casualty company a unit of kemper insurance companies kemper made the decision to substantially cease underwriting operations and voluntarily entered into run off a run off is the professional management of an insurance companys discontinued distressed or nonrenewed lines of insurance and associated liabilities outside of a judicial proceeding in the event the run off process is not successful and kemper is forced into bankruptcy or a similar proceeding most states have established guaranty funds to pay remaining claims however the guarantee associations in some states including texas have asserted that state law returns the liability for open claims under such policies to the insured as we experienced when another former insurance carrier reliance national indemnity co declared bankruptcy in in that case the texas state guaranty association asserted that it was entitled to full reimbursement from us for workers compensation benefits paid by the association although we settled that dispute within the limits of insurance coverage we had secured to cover potential claims returned to us related to the reliance policies if one or more states were to assert that liability for open claims with kemper should be returned to us we may be required to make a payment to the state covering estimated claims attributable to us any such payment would reduce net income which may have a material adverse effect on net income in the reported period the current workers compensation contract with aig expires on september in the event we are unable to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms significant disruption to our business could occur our workers compensation coverage the aig program is currently provided through selected member table of contents insurance companies of american international group inc aig under our arrangement with aig we bear the economic burden for the first million layer of claims per occurrence aig bears the economic burden for all claims in excess of such first million layer the aig program is a fully insured policy whereby aig has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities for additional discussion of our policy with aig please read item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates workers compensation costs on page in conjunction with entering into the aig program we formed a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive we recognize the captive as an insurance company for federal income tax purposes with respect to our consolidated federal income tax return in the event the internal revenue service irs were to determine that the captive does not qualify as an insurance company we could be required to make accelerated income tax payments to the irs that we otherwise would have deferred until future periods increases in unemployment tax rates we record our state unemployment tax expense based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state state unemployment tax rates vary by state and are determined in part based on prior years compensation experience in each state should our claim experience increase our unemployment tax rates could increase in addition states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax rates to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax fund some states have implemented retroactive cost increases contractual arrangements with our clients limit our ability to incorporate such increases into service fees which could result in a delay before such increases could be reflected in service fees as a result such increases could have a material adverse

and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates state unemployment taxes on page need to renew or replace clients our standard csa can be cancelled by us or the client with to days notice accordingly the short term nature of the csa makes us vulnerable to potential cancellations by existing clients which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition our results of operations are dependent in part upon our ability to retain or replace our clients upon the termination or cancellation of the csa our client attrition rate was approximately in there can be no assurance that the number of contract cancellations will continue at these levels or increase in the future competition and new market entrants the peo industry is highly fragmented many peos have limited operations and fewer than worksite employees but there are several industry participants that are comparable to our size we also encounter competition from fee for service companies such as payroll processing firms insurance companies and human resource consultants several of our competitors are peo divisions of large business services companies such as automatic data processing inc and paychex inc such companies have substantially greater resources than administaff accordingly the peo divisions of such companies may be able to provide their peo services at more competitive prices than we may be able to offer moreover we expect that as the peo industry grows and its regulatory framework becomes better established well organized competition with greater resources than us may enter the peo market possibly including large fee for service companies currently providing a more limited range of services liabilities for client and employee actions a number of legal issues remain unresolved with respect to the co employment arrangement between a peo and its worksite employees including questions concerning the ultimate liability for violations of employment and discrimination laws our csa establishes the contractual division of responsibilities between administaff and our clients for various personnel management matters including compliance with and liability under various table of contents governmental regulations however because we act as a co employer we may be subject to liability for violations of these or other laws despite these contractual provisions even if we do not participate in such violations although the csa provides that the client is to indemnify us for any liability attributable to the clients conduct we may not be able to collect on such a contractual indemnification claim and thus may be responsible for satisfying such liabilities in addition worksite employees may be deemed to be our agents which may subject us to liability for the actions of such worksite employees we maintain certain general insurance coverages including coverages for our clients to manage our exposure for these types of claims and as a result the costs in excess of insurance premiums we incur with respect to this exposure have historically been insignificant to our operating results federal state and local regulation as a major employer our operations are affected by numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to labor tax and employment matters by entering into a co employer relationship with employees assigned to work at client locations we assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under these laws however many of these laws such as erisa and federal and state employment tax laws do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of non traditional employers such as peos and the definition of employer under these laws is not uniform in addition many of the states in which we operate have not addressed the peo relationship for purposes of compliance with applicable state laws governing the employeremployee relationship any adverse application of these other federal or state laws to the peo relationship with our worksite employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition while many states do not explicitly regulate peos states have passed laws that have recognition licensing certification or registration requirements for peos and several other states are considering such regulation such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of peos and in some cases codify and clarify the co employment relationship for unemployment workers compensation and other purposes under state law while we generally support licensing regulation because it serves to validate the peo relationship we may not be able to satisfy licensing requirements or other applicable regulations for all states in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our licenses in all states geographic market concentration while we have sales offices in markets our houston and texas including houston markets accounted for approximately and respectively of our revenues for the year ended december accordingly while we have a goal of expanding in our current and future markets outside of texas for the foreseeable future a significant portion of our revenues may be subject to economic factors specific to texas including houston potential client liability for employment taxes under the csa we assume sole responsibility and liability for paying federal employment taxes imposed under the code with respect to wages and salaries we pay our worksite employees there are essentially three types of federal employment tax obligations income tax withholding requirements obligations under the federal income contribution act fica and obligations under the federal unemployment tax act futa under the code employers have the obligation to withhold and remit the employer portion and where applicable the employee portion of these taxes most states impose similar employment tax obligations on the employer while the csa provides that we have sole legal responsibility for making these tax contributions the irs or applicable state taxing authority could conclude that such liability cannot be completely transferred to us accordingly in the event that we fail to meet our tax withholding and payment obligations the client may be held jointly and severally liable for those obligations while this interpretive issue has not to our knowledge discouraged clients from enrolling with administaff a definitive adverse resolution of this issue may discourage clients from enrolling in the future table of contents item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our cash equivalent short term investments and our available for sale marketable securities the cash equivalent short term investments consist primarily of overnight investments which are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned on these investments the available for sale marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk because these securities generally include a fixed interest rate as a result the market values of these securities are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through diversification and low investment turnover our marketable securities are currently managed by two professional investment management companies each of which is guided by our investment policy our investment policy is designed to maximize after tax interest income while preserving our principal investment as a result our marketable securities consist primarily of tax exempt short and intermediate term debt securities as of december our available for sale marketable securities included an investment in a mutual fund that holds corporate debt securities with maturities up to months the amortized cost basis fair market value and day yield of this investment was million million and respectively at december the following table presents information about our available for sale marketable securities excluding the mutual fund investment as of december dollars in thousands principal average maturities interest rate thereafter total fair market value includes auction rate securities with original maturities greater than ten years however the interest rates reset at least every days based on short term market yields
