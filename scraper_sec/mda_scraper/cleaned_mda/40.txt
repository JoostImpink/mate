item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting under this method acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs other than drilling costs for successful wells including geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether each well resulted in the discovery of proved reserves if proved reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are charged to expense costs incurred to drill and equip development wells including unsuccessful development wells are capitalized internal costs related to the acquisition development and exploration of oil and gas properties are expensed as incurred interest is capitalized on qualifying assets primarily unproved and unevaluated properties the company anticipates that results of operations will continue to be significantly impacted by the level of exploration expenditures and the costs of drilling dry exploratory wells that are expensed under the successful efforts method of accounting depletion of the cost of producing oil and gas properties is computed on the unit of production method the company also accrues for platform abandonment costs related to its offshore platform facilities on the unit of production method unproved properties are assessed periodically and any impairment in value is recognized currently as impairment expense as of december the company owned unproved oil and gas properties with a book value of approximately million the company plans to commence drilling on its most significant prospects in however if such drilling activity does not result in the discovery of proved oil and gas reserves on a particular property an impairment charge would be recorded to write off the value of that property results of operations compared to revenues the company recorded oil and gas sales totaling million in compared to sales of million higher sales revenues primarily reflected a increase in the companys average realized gas price in the oil and gas industry enjoyed strong commodity prices for most of although the benefit of higher prices on the companys revenues was mitigated by the impact of certain price hedging arrangements in effect during the year the companys revenues were favorably impacted by approximately million due to the effect of higher oil and gas prices compared to the prior year the companys gas price averaged per mcf in compared to per mcf in while the average oil price realized rose slightly to per bbl in from per bbl a year earlier during the company had in effect certain commodity price hedging agreements that covered on average throughout the year approximately of its gas production and approximately of its oil production as a result of the price hedges the companys oil and gas sales revenues were reduced by approximately million during and were increased by approximately million during excluding the impact of the hedging arrangements the companys average oil and gas prices for would have been per bbl and per mcf respectively for the companys average prices exclusive of the hedges would have been per bbl and per mcf oil production increased to mmboe during reflecting a increase in the companys average daily production rate production increases in were primarily attributable to properties acquired in the offshore acquisitions which added approximately bbls of oil production in the impact of additional volumes from the new properties was partially offset by the effect of the sales of several oil producing properties in late and early increased oil production contributed approximately million to revenues gas production in declined to bcf or approximately below prior year volumes of bcf production declines in aggregating bcf due to the sale of the sawyer field in july the sawyer sale and production declines in the west mcallen field were offset by an additional bcf of gas production from the properties acquired in the offshore acquisitions an increase of bcf resulting from the installation of additional compression and pipeline facilities at the bradshaw field and an increase of bcf from the completion of a well at high island block l the reduction in gas volumes negatively impacted sales by approximately million in the company recognized a net gain of on the sales of various properties during in the company reported a net gain on property sales mainly the sawyer sale of approximately million other revenues totaling in primarily represented the proceeds from the sales of seismic data in other revenues of related to a certain gas contract settlement and gas balancing income offset by the accrual of a loss under certain swap agreements then in effect see compared to below costs and expenses production and operating costs totaled million or per boe in compared to million or per boe in the decrease in total costs was primarily attributable to the reduction of approximately million related to the sawyer field while the decline in the companys operating costs per unit of production was mainly attributable to the impact of the offshore properties acquired in such properties generally have higher production rates and therefore lower operating costs per unit than the companys onshore properties depreciation depletion and amortization dda totaled million and million for and respectively the decline in dda expense was mainly attributable to lower gas production in the companys average dda rate was essentially unchanged during despite generally higher depletion rates for the offshore properties acquired in which rates reflect a provision for platform abandonment costs as prescribed by applicable accounting standards no depreciation or depletion expense was recorded during the last half of for certain assets that had been reclassified to assets held for sale at the end of the second quarter those assets were sold during the fourth quarter of general and administrative ga expense totaling million was below the prior year expense of million the decline in ga expense was mainly attributable to reduced legal fees in ga expense per unit of production averaged per boe in compared to per boe in exploration expense totaled million in and million in the company drilled exploratory wells in with a success rate compared to only three wells in all of which were unsuccessful accordingly the company recorded dry hole expense of million in compared to million for the prior year in addition exploration expense included million of geological and geophysical expense primarily reflecting the costs of d seismic data covering certain areas in the texas state waters and south texas impairment expense for unproved properties upon which no further exploration activity will be conducted totaled million and million in and respectively interest expense of million in declined from the prior year interest expense in reflected higher bank debt carried in the first half of following the completion of the appl consolidation the income tax provision for primarily represented deferred state income tax expense extraordinary item the million extraordinary gain recorded in resulted from the extinguishment of nonrecourse debt in conjunction with the appl consolidation net income loss the company reported a net loss of million or per share in and net income of million or per share in the loss was mainly attributable to dry hole and seismic data acquisition costs totaling million under the successful efforts method of accounting costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells and seismic data expenditures are expensed as incurred net income in reflected the impact of numerous nonrecurring transactions most notably a million gain on property sales primarily the sawyer sale and a million extraordinary gain on debt extinguishment compared to revenues oil and gas sales totaled million in or higher than sales of million the increase in sales revenues primarily reflected higher production volumes that resulted from the acquisition of investors interests in the appl programs through the appl consolidation the company acquired mmboe and mmboe of proved oil and gas reserves in late and early respectively the appl consolidation together with successful development activity at the midway and west mcallen fields and the west cameron block resulted in a net production increase of mmboe in compared to the higher production levels achieved through the appl consolidation were partially offset by the loss of production due to the sawyer sale the companys total oil and gas production increased to mmboe in from mmboe in contributing million to oil and gas sales oil and gas sales reflected the impact of lower gas prices offset by higher oil prices received in the company realized an average price of per bbl in compared to in which resulted in a million addition to sales revenues the companys average gas price realization declined to per mcf in or below the prior year average the decline in the average gas price negatively impacted sales revenues by million during and the company had periodically entered into certain price hedging arrangements primarily related to a portion of its natural gas production the company realized a million gain on its hedging activities in both and which gains were reflected in the oil and gas sales revenues of each year excluding the impact of the hedging gains the companys average price per mcf of gas would have been and in and respectively oil prices were not significantly affected by price hedging agreements in either year in july the company sold its interest in the sawyer field to louis dreyfus natural gas corp for a purchase price of million american recorded a gain on the sawyer sale of approximately million in sales of various other fields in resulted in a net loss of approximately in the company recognized a million gain on the divestiture of minor properties other revenues totaled and in and respectively in the company recorded gas settlement income of primarily consisting of the proceeds from certain litigation regarding the terms of a gas purchase contract american also recognized approximately of gas balancing income during primarily relating to cash balancing settlements receivable on various wells that were plugged and abandoned during during december the company accrued as a reduction of other revenues due to the loss of correlation between actual cash prices and the prices under the swap agreements at the henry hub market reference price other revenues recorded in primarily included gas balancing income costs and expenses production and operating costs increased to million in from million in the increase in costs was mainly attributable to higher production levels resulting from the appl consolidation although that increase was mitigated by a reduction in environmental expenses in during the company incurred million of site remediation costs in connection with various environmental proceedings on a unit cost basis production and operating costs per boe decreased to per boe in from per boe in reflecting continued operating efficiencies achieved following the completion of the appl consolidation dda totaled million in or over dda of million the companys dda per boe rate decreased substantially in consequently americans dda expense did not increase proportionately with the production increase in dda per boe decreased to per boe in from per boe in the lower dda rate reflected the effect of the acquisition of interests through the appl consolidation and the impact of a million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of which reduced the cost basis of certain oil and gas properties ga expense declined to million in from million a year earlier the reduction in ga expense resulted primarily from staff reductions in the first half of and a million severance charge recorded in late in connection with the elimination of certain partnerships managed by american these decreases were partially offset by the loss of management and technical fee reimbursements previously received from the appl programs the companys continuing focus on controlling administrative costs resulted in a reduction in ga expense per unit of production which averaged per boe in compared to per boe in exploration expense totaled million and million in and respectively american recognized million of dry hole expense on three wells in including two offshore wells and recorded million of impairment expense in related primarily to the fourth quarter write off of an unproved offshore property in the company recorded million of dry hole expense related to three unsuccessful wells and million of impairment expense including a million charge to write off americans remaining leasehold interest in tunisia the company also recorded a million impairment charge in related to a change in accounting policy interest expense of million in was below expense of million primarily due to the repayment of million of bank debt using the proceeds of the sawyer sale in july in addition american extinguished certain nonrecourse debt associated with the appl programs totaling million and million in and respectively other expense of million in included million of fees paid by american in connection with a new bank credit agreement and a bridge facility with new york life extraordinary item american recorded extraordinary gains of million in and million in related to the elimination of nonrecourse debt in conjunction with the appl consolidation the gain represented the difference between the outstanding note balances and the actual purchase price of the notes net income loss american reported net income of million or per share in and a net loss of million or per share in nonrecurring transactions reflected in net income included a million gain on property sales primarily the sawyer sale a million extraordinary gain on the extinguishment of debt and of gas settlement income partially negated by a million impairment charge and a loss related to certain natural gas hedges in contrast results included the negative impact of a million impairment charge partially offset by a million extraordinary gain and a million gain on property sales excluding the effect of these nonrecurring transactions in both years the company would have recorded net losses of million and million in and respectively the improvement in operating results primarily reflected a million increase in net operating revenues which resulted from higher production levels and reduced unit operating costs following the appl consolidation in addition reductions in ga and interest expense in more than offset higher dda and exploration expense recorded in that year capital resources and liquidity americans principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing activities during the last two years the company has also generated substantial cash flows from the sale of oil and gas properties most notably the sawyer sale in americans primary capital requirements are to fund the companys development and exploration programs and acquisition activity american also has financial obligations related to the companys convertible preferred stock and its senior subordinated notes the subordinated notes net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in million in and million in cash flow for reflected improved operating margins due to strong oil and gas prices and the impact of lower operating costs for the companys offshore properties which represented a greater portion of the property base in net cash provided by operating activities was reduced in by the effect of a million negative working capital change due to a higher accounts receivable balance at year end in contrast net cash provided by operating activities in reflected a million positive working capital adjustment due to an increase in the accounts payable balance at year end excluding the impact of working capital adjustments the companys cash flow from operations increased by approximately million from to the improvement in operating cash flows in compared to reflected the impact of the appl consolidation and successful development activity which together resulted in a increase in production relative to in addition the companys operating margins increased in as unit costs for production ga and interest expense decreased in as compared to as of december the borrowing base under the credit agreement was million and outstanding bank debt totaled million all of which was classified as long term the borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined semiannually every march and september the march redetermination is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of the credit agreement and the subordinated notes require the company to comply with certain covenants including but not limited to restrictions on indebtedness investments payment of dividends and lease commitments and a requirement to maintain a minimum net worth of million cash dividends are restricted on the companys common stock and annual preferred dividends are limited to of the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time not to exceed million the current annual limit on preferred dividends is million in addition these agreements contain cross default provisions the company was in compliance with these covenants at year end in november the company closed the sale of approximately million shares of common stock in a public offering that generated net proceeds to the company of approximately million proceeds from the stock offering were used to reduce outstanding bank debt proceeds from the sales of oil and gas properties totaled approximately million million and million in and respectively in december the company received approximately million subject to post closing adjustments from the divestiture of certain properties in connection with the nylog liquidation also in the company sold for approximately million a interest in high island block which american had purchased in the september acquisition property sales in primarily included the sawyer sale for gross proceeds of million the sawyer sale proceeds were applied to substantially reduce the companys outstanding bank debt which had increased as a result of the appl consolidation divestitures in were comprised of non strategic low value properties cash expenditures for the acquisition of oil and gas properties totaled approximately million in million in and million in acquisition expenditures in included approximately million for the march acquisition million for the september acquisition and approximately million for the ancon acquisition the remainder of the acquisition expenditures primarily related to the purchase of leasehold interests including acreage in the cotton valley area of east texas and in the yoakum gorge area of south texas in the company expended approximately million related to the appl consolidation and million for certain interests in the buckner field in arkansas and also purchased several offshore blocks in the gulf of mexico property acquisitions in mainly related to the appl consolidation cash expenditures for development totaled approximately million million and million in and respectively american participated in drilling development wells net in of which net were successfully completed development activity in was focused in the companys offshore operating area including high island block l the brazos complex and the properties acquired in the offshore acquisitions the company also completed eleven net wells at the bradshaw field in kansas cash expenditures for exploration activities totaled approximately million in compared to approximately million and million in and respectively the company participated in exploratory wells net in with a success rate exploration efforts were concentrated in the gulf of mexico and in the wilcox and frio trends of south texas there can be no assurances regarding the success of any wells drilled and exploratory wells involve greater risks than development wells under successful efforts accounting the costs incurred for the drilling of unsuccessful exploratory wells and for the acquisition of seismic data are recorded as exploration expense and negatively impact net income in the period in which incurred the company expects its capital expenditures for development and exploration activities to total approximately million the actual amount of such expenditures will depend on various factors including among other factors oil and gas prices the level of exploration success and subsequent development activity the company intends to fund its planned capital expenditures commitments and working capital requirements through cash flows from operations and borrowings under the credit agreement however if there are changes in oil and gas prices which correspondingly affect cash flows and bank borrowings or if additional development and exploration opportunities arise the company may adjust its capital budget accordingly other potential sources of capital for the company include property sales and financings through the issuance of debt or equity securities management believes that the company will have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund its capital expenditures and meet its financial obligations as they are due the company is subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment which laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent the company has conducted a review of its operations with particular attention to environmental compliance the company believes it has acted as a prudent operator and is in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations the company has recorded site remediation costs of and million in and respectively the site remediation costs incurred in primarily related to certain lawsuits american cannot predict what impact environmental laws and regulations will have on its future performance but does not currently anticipate the incurrence of material environmental expenditures however the company believes that such laws do not affect american in a materially different manner from other similarly situated companies in the oil and gas industry the companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of compared to at year end the company historically has operated with a working capital deficit primarily due to timing differences between the receipt of reimbursements from other working interest owners in the properties operated by the company and the payment of expenses with respect to such properties changing oil and gas prices the companys revenues cash flow profitability and future rate of growth as well as the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile various factors beyond the control of the company affect prices of oil and natural gas including worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil and gas political and economic conditions weather conditions the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree on and maintain price and production controls political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions the price of foreign imports the level of consumer demand the price and availability of alternative fuels and changes in existing federal and state regulations any significant decline in oil or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the companys operations financial condition and level of development and exploration expenditures and could result in a reduction of the companys borrowing base under the credit agreement thereby reducing the amount of credit available to the company to fund its exploration development and acquisition activities part of the companys business strategy is to reduce its exposure to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices by entering into financial arrangements designed to provide some protection against price declines including swaps and futures agreements the companys objective is to reduce the risk that a sharp drop in oil or natural gas prices will cause the company to defer various capital spending projects in certain circumstances significant reductions in production due to unforeseen events could require the company to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by production to reduce this risk the company strives to hedge less than its expected production hedging will also prevent the company from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the amount specified in the hedge as of december the company had hedges in place that covered approximately of its oil production and approximately of its gas production based on average daily production during december for a discussion of hedging arrangements related to production reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements in item potential dilution of equity ownership as of december the company had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding in addition i up to approximately million shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of the companys convertible preferred stock at a conversion price of per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances ii approximately million shares are issuable upon exercise of stock options outstanding at december at prices ranging from to per share with a weighted average exercise price of per share and iii approximately million shares are issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding at december at a weighted average exercise price of per share
