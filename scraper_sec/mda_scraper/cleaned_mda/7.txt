item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the company is one of the nations leading producers of construction aggregates a major provider of ready mix concrete and concrete products in the southeastern and mid atlantic states and a significant supplier of cement in florida and georgia we operate through three business segments construction aggregates concrete products and cement and calcium the construction aggregates segment is engaged in the mining processing distribution and sale of sand gravel and crushed stone the concrete products segment is engaged in production and sale of ready mix concrete concrete block prestressed concrete as well as sales of other building materials the cement and calcium products segment is engaged in the production and sale of portland and masonry cement the importation of cement and slag which are either sold or ground or blended and then sold and the sale of calcium products to the animal feed industry during fiscal our business was significantly affected by the dramatic downturn in residential construction activity in florida for the contribution made to net sales and operating profit from each business segment see note to the consolidated financial statements on february we agreed to merge with vulcan materials company pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated february the merger was approved by our shareholders on august and is expected to close on or about november our business we are a major basic construction materials company concentrating on growth markets in the southeastern and mid atlantic states we operate in three business segments construction aggregates cement and calcium products and concrete products construction aggregates our construction aggregates segment is engaged in the mining processing distribution and sale of crushed stone sand and gravel our construction aggregates segment operates plants in multiple states crushed base rock sand gravel and distribution stone plants plants industrial sand terminals florida georgia tennessee alabama maryland delaware virginia illinois kentucky louisiana canada bahamas note chart includes one joint venture crushed stone plant in georgia and one joint venture crushed stone plant in canada during fiscal we produced and shipped million tons of construction aggregates currently we have billion tons of permitted reserves concrete products segment our concrete products segment produces and sells ready mix concrete concrete block prestressed and precast concrete and sells other building materials in multiple states table of contents ready mix concrete concrete prestress precast plants block plants plants plant florida georgia north carolina virginia district of columbia maryland bahamas in we had a delivery fleet of ready mix and block trucks cement and calcium products our cement and calcium products segment operates a cement plant in newberry florida import terminals and grinding facilities in tampa and port manatee florida and a limestone grinding facility in brooksville florida our newberry cement plant produced tons of cement in construction to double the annual production capacity of this plant continued in construction is expected to be completed in early fiscal our tampa facility imports blends or bags and sells cement and grinds blends and sells granulate blast furnace slag our port manatee facility imports and grinds clinker unground cement and sells the ground cement our brooksville facility operates a limestone grinding plant that provides product for the animal feed industry and paint plastic and joint compound industries business environment our business principally serves customers in the construction industry our business is impacted by a number of factors affecting the construction industry and the economy as a whole although a number of different factors risks and trends affect our business we have highlighted some of these factors below our markets construction activity and general economic conditions in our principal markets significantly affect our results the following breakdown shows our sales by market market of sales of sales florida mid atlantic georgia north carolina tennessee illinois kentucky alabama construction activity residential construction has declined dramatically in our florida markets we cannot estimate when the housing market will turn around and until residential construction recovers volumes will continue to trail fiscal volumes construction activity in our markets is affected by a number of factors including population growth economic conditions interest rates and other factors table of contents our financial results also are affected by highway construction spending levels on august the safe accountable flexible and efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users became law providing billion in guaranteed funding for federal highway transit and safety programs we expect this legislation to result in modest increases in highway construction spending over the next several years cement supplies in there was a severe cement shortage in the florida market the cement shortage was fueled by a record level of demand unusual downtime at some of our competitors plants and limited availability of imports due to stronger international demand particularly in china and a shortage of available barges the cement shortage eased in although many states in our markets experienced somewhat tight supply conditions demand for cement products also weakened in late fiscal as a result of the slowdown in residential construction during fiscal the demand continues to weaken as a result of the slowdown in residential construction during due to this weak demand our newberry cement plant was shutdown for thirty nine days due to lack of storage space for our product we began construction of an expansion of our newberry plant in fiscal some of our competitors also either are expanding capacity or building new plants additional factors influencing operations our operations are influenced by a number of other external and internal factors external factors include weather competition interest rates fuel costs transportation costs driver availability labor costs and inflation internal factors include sales mix plant location quality and quantities of aggregates reserves capacity utilization and other operating factors in october a hurricane affected southern florida and caused a disruption of business during the first quarter of fiscal rail operations were interrupted resulting in restricted delivery of product to our terminals this interruption caused a shortage of aggregate production in some parts of florida which affected business in areas not affected by the hurricane during the first quarter of fiscal financial results are affected by planned maintenance at the cement plant since these costs which can be significant are expensed when incurred the company expensed planned maintenance of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the plant was shut down for twenty three days in fiscal and nineteen days in fiscal for planned maintenance planned maintenance is scheduled for the first quarter of fiscal at an estimated cost of as compared to for the first quarter of fiscal planned maintenance costs typically result in an overhaul to the wear parts of the major operating components since the cement manufacturing process is continuous the coordination of the repair to multiple components is paramount items that typically are inspected repaired and or replaced during an outage include chain and belt conveyors idlers rollers mill journals impact hammers grinding table liners separator blades mill liners bearings fans ductwork airslides grinding media refractory castable and shell replacement our insurance program consists of the company self insuring a portion of the claims and paying premiums for coverage in excess of this self insurance retention the self insurance retention level is determined by comparing the premium for the coverage versus the potential exposure for the automobile insurance programs self insurance retention is per occurrence for workers compensation and general liability insurance programs the self insurance retention is per occurrence with an aggregate of for general liability operating review fiscal sales declined to from for fiscal due to decreased demand in all three business segments the primary reason for the revenue decline is volume decreases in all three of our business segments due to a significant slow down in construction table of contents activity particularly in the residential markets in addition sales prices for cement decreased slightly due to a change in product mix and lower sales price of concrete block these decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices in our aggregate segment and the higher average selling price of ready mix concrete in our aggregates segment for the year volumes at our producing locations were down over volumes although volume declines were partially offset by a increase in the average selling price volumes decreased in both our southern and northern operations in our concrete segment for the year volumes of ready mix concrete declined while our block volumes were down compared to sales prices for ready mix concrete increased and for concrete block decreased in our cement operations for the year volumes decreased and the average selling price of cement declined fiscal sales increased to from in fiscal due to increased revenues in all three business segments these increases were attributable to both increased volumes and sales prices of construction aggregates at producing locations ready mix concrete concrete block and building materials and cement in our aggregates segment for fiscal volumes at our producing locations were up over volumes primarily from acquisitions at the end of fiscal or early fiscal increased volumes from our quarry on the ohio river in illinois acquired at the beginning of fiscal and from our georgia and florida operations these volume increases were offset by decreases in volumes at our distribution terminals of and lower volumes in our virginia and maryland markets in our concrete segment for fiscal volumes of ready mix concrete were up while our block volumes were down compared to sales prices for ready mix were up and for block were up in our cement operations for fiscal volumes decreased due to lower volumes at our grinding facilities partially offset by increased volumes at the newberry cement plant gross profit for fiscal decreased and gross margin decreased to of sales as compared to for we experienced gross profit and gross margin declines in all three business segments due to sales declines our business is capital intensive resulting in significant fixed costs when we experience these levels of decreases in volumes it will cause a significant decrease in our gross profit margin and gross profit construction aggregates declines were primarily due to decreased volumes and higher depreciation expense due to completion of new production facilities and high fixed costs partially offset by increased prices the cement and calcium group declines for the year were due to reduced volumes and higher costs our concrete products segment for the year declined due to reduced ready mix and block volumes and higher fixed costs partially offset by increased sales prices of ready mix concrete the cement and concrete products segments were adversely affected by increased raw material prices depreciation expense was approximately higher which depressed profit and margin gross profit for fiscal increased and gross margin increased to of sales as compared to for these increases were due to all three business segments gross profit and gross margin improvements construction aggregates improvements were primarily due to higher sales prices and increased volumes gross profit in fiscal benefited from an insurance settlement of table of contents which recovered costs previously expensed the cement and calcium group improvement for the year was due to price increases partially offset by the reduced volumes our concrete products segment for fiscal improved due to increased sales prices and ready mix volumes all three segments gross profit and margins were adversely affected by dramatic increases in fuel and energy costs and construction aggregates and concrete products were adversely affected by repairs and maintenance the cement and concrete products segments were adversely affected by increased raw material prices gross profit in fiscal also benefited from an insurance settlement of which recovered costs previously expensed fuel costs were higher in as compared to repair costs increased in fiscal higher depreciation expense of approximately also depressed profit and margin selling general and administrative sga expenses on a consolidated basis decreased in sga as a percentage of sales were for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the dollar decrease is due to reduced profit sharing and management incentive compensation which are both linked to earnings before income taxes and real estate gains reduced professional services reduced contributions and reduced risk insurance cost and a general reduction in selling general and administrative costs these lower expenses were partially offset by of costs related to our merger with vulcan sga expense decreased in all three business segments primarily due to profit sharing and management incentive without these decreased expenses sga expenses for each of the business segments would have decreased slightly for corporate overhead sga expenses increased as a result of merger expenses selling general and administrative sga expenses on a consolidated basis increased in compared to sga as a percentage of sales were for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the dollar increase is due to profit sharing and management incentive compensation which are both linked to earnings before income taxes and real estate gains stock option expense related to the adoption of fas r which increased cost by and legal services all three business segments had an increase in sga expense primarily due to profit sharing management incentive and stock option expenses without these increased expenses sga expenses for each of the business segments would have increased slightly for corporate overhead sga expenses increased as a result of higher profit sharing management incentive stock option expense and professional fees in fiscal sga expenses benefited from reimbursement of legal fees in connection with the insurance settlement discussed above and from life insurance proceeds consolidated operating profit decreased to in as compared to for the same period last year gains on the sale of real estate this year were versus during fiscal operating profit for the year for the aggregates group decreased to from last year this was due to a decrease in volume partially offset by price increases the aggregates group did not have real estate gains in fiscal as compared to last year for the concrete products segment operating profit decreased to from last year this was due to decrease in ready mix volumes and a decrease in block volumes partially offset by price increases for the cement and calcium segment operating profit decreased to from last year this decrease is primarily due to reduced volumes consolidated operating profit increased to in as compared to in fiscal included the gain on the sale of a former quarry and other real estate which resulted in a gain of gains on the sale of real estate in fiscal were operating profit for for the aggregates group increased to from this was due to a increase in volume and price increases slightly offset by higher sga expense and further reduced by higher fuel and repair costs the aggregates table of contents group had real estate gains of in as compared to in fiscal for the concrete products segment operating profit increased to from in fiscal this was due to increase in ready mix volumes price increases and additional real estate gains of these increases were slightly offset by increased fuel and sga expenses for the cement and calcium segment operating profit increased to from in this increase was due to higher prices partially offset by increased sga expenses interest expense for increased to from in as a result of interest on non debt obligations interest of was capitalized this year as compared to last year interest expense for decreased to from in as a result of lower debt outstanding on revolving credit agreements and capitalization of interest of interest income for was as compared to last year the decrease is the result of having less average excess cash available during fiscal for investment in short term investments the company ended the year with approximately million of cash and cash equivalents interest income for was as compared to in fiscal year s interest income included of interest income on the insurance settlement discussed above the increase was the result of having more excess cash available during fiscal for investment in short term investments during fiscal the company had very little usage of its revolving credit facilities the company ended the year with approximately million of excess cash other income decreased from last year primarily from gains on sale of other assets last year and lower equity in affiliates other income for includes a gain from an exchange of real estate which resulted from a legal settlement of also included in other income in fiscal is a gain of from the sale of a interest in an affiliate included in other income is our equity in the operating results of our joint ventures during fiscal this equity in earnings of joint ventures was a loss of as compared to last year this loss is the result of reduced volumes income tax expense decreased to in as compared to last year this is due to lower income before taxes and a decrease in the effective tax rate to versus last year income tax expense increased to in as compared to in this is due to higher income before taxes and a decrease in the effective tax rate to versus last year the decrease in effective income tax rate is due to the manufacturers credit in fiscal and an increase in excess percentage depletion as a result of increased revenues net earnings for fiscal were as compared to last year included in net earnings for this year is the gain on the sale of real estate of pre tax after tax included in fiscal was the gain on the sale of real estate of after tax and a gain of pretax from the exchange of real estate after tax liquidity and capital resources the following key financial measurements reflect the

such as financing or variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience current and expected economic conditions and in some cases actuarial calculations we constantly review these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate actual results could differ from those estimates historically actual results have not significantly deviated from estimated results determined using the factors described above note to the consolidated financial statements provides detail on the application of these and other accounting policies these critical accounting policies and note should be read in conjunction with this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations table of contents the following is a discussion of the accounting policies considered to be most critical to the company these accounting policies are both most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure regarding critical accounting estimates self insurance reserves it is our policy to self insure for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property business interruptions workers compensation comprehensive general liability product liability and auto liability insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract based on an independent actuarys estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred a provision for claims under the self insured program is recorded and adjusted monthly the actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources including changes in claim reporting patterns claims settlement patterns judicial decisions legislation and economic conditions although the company believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the companys self insurance obligations and future expense long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the period of depreciation or amortization for long lived assets to determine whether current circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives the company reviews its property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset an impairment loss would be recorded for the excess of net carrying value over the fair value of the asset impaired the fair value is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows the results of impairment tests are subject to managements estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows and operating results the company believes that based on current conditions materially different reported results are not likely to result from long lived asset impairments however a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different reported results intangible assets and goodwill financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no sfas goodwill and other intangible assets requires companies to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value the company has determined that it has three reporting units and the annual impairment test will be performed as of september th sfas also requires that the carrying value of an identifiable intangible asset that has an indefinite life be determined by using a fair value based approach the valuation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including but not limited to projected future revenue and cash flows the company believes that based on current conditions materially different reported results are not likely to result from goodwill and intangible impairments however a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different report results inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market inventory for the aggregates segment on a quarterly basis is based on internal table of contents estimates of production during the period an outside consultant measures the volume of aggregates inventory for our large quarries on a quarterly basis and the balance of the locations primarily on a semi annual basis aggregates inventory is adjusted to the amounts shown in the report of the outside consultant asset retirement obligation sfas no accounting for asset retirement obligations and fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no require that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is amortized over the life of the asset the liability is accreted at the end of each reporting period through charges to operating expenses if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement for concrete and terminal locations asset retirement obligations are recorded for lease stipulated requirements as well as closure obligations related to storage tanks for the cement and calcium segment asset retirement obligations have been provided for obligations to reclaim mining sites asbestos removal and closure obligations related to storage tanks for the aggregates segment an asset retirement obligation was provided where the company has a legal obligation to reclaim the mining site and closure obligations related to storage tanks assessments claims and litigation from time to time the company is involved with assessments claims and litigation the company uses both in house and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss the company establishes an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated accruals for remediation efforts are recorded no later than the time a feasibility study is undertaken and the company commits to a formal plan of action additionally legal fees associated with these matters are accrued at the time such claims are made there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these assessments claims and litigation will not differ materially from the company estimates employee benefits under the provisions of sfas no employers accounting for pensions and sfas no employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions measurement of the obligations under employee benefits plans are subject to a number of assumptions these include the rate of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to the value of the liability see note to the consolidated financial statements related party transactions patriot transportation holding inc patriot a related party through common directors see note to the consolidated financial statements hauls diesel fuel cement and other supplies for the company charges for such services are based on prevailing market prices the company also leases various aggregate mining and other properties paying rent or royalties based on long term contracts entered into during the mid s and early s in addition the company provides administrative services to patriot these services are provided at market prices on october the company entered into a joint venture with a subsidiary of patriot transportation holding inc frp to develop property near brooksville florida we contributed approximately acres of land with a book value of and frp contributed approximately acres of land which the company leased from patriot under a long term mining lease in addition we contributed an additional acre parcel that we acquired in and frp reimbursed us for one half of the acquisition costs of that parcel the companys investment in the joint venture is as of september the company and frp are each required to fund up to million each in additional capital contributions the company will continue to conduct mining operations on a portion of the property and pay royalties to frp based on actual tons mined table of contents new accounting pronouncements in march the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue

company as of september see note with the exception of the measurement date provisions which are effective for the companys fiscal year ending september outlook residential construction in our markets continues to show significant weakness with the subprime credit crunch adding additional negative impact non residential is still slightly ahead of the prior year but these comparisons will get tougher in the coming months and without any rebound in residential historical precedent would indicate softening in non residential construction as well in the coming months highwayinfrastructure spending remains strong but will be dependent on continued strength in tax revenues for the states in the coming year during the fourth quarter of fiscal the level of construction activity in the residential sector decreased resulting in a reduction in volumes in all three business segments the volumes in these segments in fiscal have continued to be depressed from fiscal levels the temporary shutdown of mining ordered by the federal court for our miami quarry continues in effect while our appeal of that order remains pending before the eleventh circuit court of appeals meanwhile we expect the army corps of engineers to issue the supplemental environmental impact statement ordered by the federal district court in early for further discussion of the issues surrounding the miami quarry refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for our cement segment construction continues on our expansion with completion now scheduled for late calendar or early the decline in residential construction is depressing our volumes in this segment with little expectation of any near term improvement in demand high shipping costs are holding up the price of cement imports
