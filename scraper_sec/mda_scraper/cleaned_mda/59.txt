item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in the following two business segments which are managed separately based on fundamental differences in operations program management services and hospitals program management services include hospital rehabilitation services including inpatient acute and subacute rehabilitation and outpatient therapy programs and skilled nursing rehabilitation services including contract therapy in skilled nursing facilities resident centered management consulting services and staffing services for therapists and nurses our hospitals segment owns and operates long term acute care hospitals ltachs and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals year ended december in thousands revenues program management skilled nursing rehabilitation services hospital rehabilitation services program management total hospitals total operating earnings loss program management skilled nursing rehabilitation services hospital rehabilitation services program management total hospitals unallocated corporate expenses total the operating earnings of hospitals include million of acquisition related expenses for costs directly related to the acquisition of triumph including fees for legal accounting advisory and other outside services represents general corporate overhead costs associated with phase consulting inc which was sold on june effective november we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of triumph healthcare holdings inc triumph for a purchase price of approximately million on the acquisition date triumph operated ltachs in seven states triumphs results of operations have been included in our financial statements prospectively beginning after the date of acquisition in we also acquired ltachs in dallas texas and philadelphia pennsylvania and opened a majority owned ltach in peoria illinois in we opened an ltach in houston texas these activities expanded the number of ltachs we own and operate to making us the third largest ltach provider in the united states in november we announced that we had entered into an equity exchange agreement with select medical corporation under which we agreed to exchange our bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in miami the miami hospital for selects bed long term acute care hospital in northwest indiana this transaction closed on january the miami hospital has been classified as a discontinued operation pursuant to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap prior year comparative amounts throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been adjusted to reflect the treatment of the miami hospital as a discontinued operation effective june we completed the sale of all the outstanding common stock of phase consulting inc phase to premier inc for approximately million phase provides management and economic consulting services to the healthcare industry and had been a subsidiary of ours since it was acquired in this transaction allows our management to focus on its core businesses phase has been classified as a discontinued operation pursuant to gaap sources of revenue in our program management segment we derive the majority of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payors a portion of our revenues in this segment are derived from our direct bill contract therapy rehab agencies our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms our contract therapy services are typically provided under one to two year agreements primarily with skilled nursing facilities in our hospital segment we derive nearly all of our revenues from fees for patient care services which are usually paid for or reimbursed by medicare medicaid or third party managed care programs our hospital segment accounted for of our consolidated operating revenues in the following table identifies the primary payer sources and relative mix of our hospital segments net operating revenues for the periods stated year ended december medicare medicaid other third party payors self pay total net patient revenue other revenue triumphs results of operations have been included in our hospital segments results prospectively beginning after the november date of acquisition the decrease in the percent of net revenues attributable to medicare from to reflects an increase in revenues attributable to managed medicare and private fee for service plans that are included in other third party payors category in the table above as part of the balanced budget act of congress created a program of private managed healthcare coverage for medicare beneficiaries this program has been referred to as medicare part c medicare+choice or medicare advantage while we expect our payor mix will remain heavily weighted towards traditional medicare we could continue to see a shift of traditional medicare patients into managed medicare and private fee for service plans results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings bear to operating revenues for the years ended december and year ended december operating

hospital rehabilitation services hospitals consolidated revenues consolidated operating revenues increased from million in to over billion in the revenue increase primarily reflects the continued growth of our hospital and skilled nursing rehabilitation services the growth in our hospital business is primarily due to the acquisition of triumph on november but also reflects same store revenue growth revenues for hospital rehabilitation services increased slightly in skilled nursing rehabilitation services srs srs operating revenues increased million or from to the average number of contract therapy locations operated in grew compared to same store contract therapy revenues increased by while minutes of service decreased by in as compared to same store revenues grew by in as compared to the reduction in our same store revenue growth rate primarily reflects both pricing pressure resulting from a market basket decrease for skilled nursing facilities as per cmss final rule for rate year which was effective beginning on october and a reduction in medicare part b therapy minutes delivered resulting from the elimination of the part b therapy cap exception process during the months of january and february we also believe the higher same store revenue growth rate in the prior year reflected the continued development and implementation of clinical programs designed to achieve optimal outcomes and there is currently less of an opportunity for incremental growth from such programs hospital rehabilitation services hrs hrs operating revenues increased million or from to as inpatient revenue declined by and outpatient revenue increased by the decline in inpatient revenue in was primarily due to a decline in the average number of inpatient programs operated partially offset by a increase in average revenue per program the increase in average revenue per program reflects same store inpatient rehabilitation facility irf revenue and discharge growth of and respectively compared to hrs operated irf programs as of december compared to as of december the increase in outpatient revenue in reflects a increase in average revenue per program due to a increase in outpatient same store revenues a increase in same store outpatient units of service and a significant change in contract mix the average number of outpatient units operated declined by in hospitals hospitals segment revenues increased million or from to triumph including the impact of new locations in philadelphia and houston heights contributed incremental revenues of million in the increase in revenues in also reflects the june acquisition of an ltach in dallas texas and the august opening of an ltach in peoria illinois which became certified as an ltach effective may same store revenues increased by million or in reflecting a increase in same store patient discharges and a increase in same store revenue per patient day primarily attributable to improved case management cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses selling general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues as a result of improved operating performance by our hospitals segment particularly our legacy hospitals triumph also contributed to the hospital segments improvement in this impact was partially offset by an increase in srss and hrss operating expenses as explained below the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects the increase in consolidated revenues resulting in improved fixed overhead leverage combined with the cost savings achieved by corporate and division realignment activities completed in and a reduction in corporate senior management incentive costs incurred in selling general and administrative expenses for also included approximately million of external costs associated with the triumph acquisition our provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses on a consolidated basis the provision for doubtful accounts increased by million from

operating expenses selling general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses hospitals operating expenses selling general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses skilled nursing rehabilitation services srs total srs costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue remained flat in compared to direct operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue as a increase in contract therapy labor and benefit costs per minute of service more than offset increases in average contract therapy revenue per minute the increase in labor costs is primarily the result of lower therapist productivity in which we believe was negatively impacted by the rollout of our new point of service technologies to approximately of our units the transition to minimum data set mds and a shift away from concurrent therapy to therapy in individual settings this shift to therapy in individual settings began in september in anticipation of reimbursement rule changes on concurrent therapy that went into effect on october selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of unit revenue declined in primarily as a result of improvements in fixed overhead leverage combined with lower corporate and division management incentive costs depreciation and amortization expense decreased as certain fixed assets and intangible assets became fully amortized in and as a result of these factors combined with higher revenues srss operating earnings increased by approximately million from million in to million in hospital rehabilitation services hrs total hrs costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue in primarily due to a change in our outpatient contract mix selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of

improved leverage of selling general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses combined start up and ramp up losses decreased from million in to million in the losses primarily related to the ramp up of our ltach in kansas city missouri and start up of our ltach in peoria illinois while the losses relate entirely to the start up and ramp up of our ltach in peoria illinois additionally the dallas ltac hospital which was acquired on june improved its operating earnings by approximately million from to selling general and administrative expenses decreased from the prior year largely due to improvements in fixed overhead leverage combined with a million decrease in merger acquisition and joint venture development expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased from to primarily due to depreciation and amortization associated with triumph but declined as a percentage of revenue the hospital segment generated operating earnings of million in compared to an operating loss of million in the triumph hospitals contributed operating earnings of million and million in and respectively non operating items interest expense increased from million

loan origination fees amortization of original issue discounts commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million in from million in the provision for income taxes was million in and million in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes less net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate reflects a lower overall weighted average statutory state tax rate resulting from the triumph acquisition and a smaller unfavorable effective tax rate impact of permanent tax differences due to increased taxable income in addition during the second quarter of we recognized a million tax benefit for the combined impact of the reversal of a contingency reserve due to a favorable ruling received from the internal revenue service and the benefit of tax credits identified during the quarter finally the higher effective tax rate in reflects the fact that certain acquisition related expenses incurred in connection with the triumph transaction were not deductible for tax purposes we recorded income from discontinued operations net of tax of approximately million in and million in such income primarily relates to the operations of our miami hospital which was classified as held for sale as of december income from discontinued operations in is net of a million after tax loss on the sale of phase net earnings losses attributable to noncontrolling interests

costs and expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to improved operating performances by all of our businesses the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects the increase in revenues combined with the cost savings achieved by eliminating approximately corporate and division support positions in the second half of these cost savings were more than offset by an increase in both long term and short term management incentives reflecting our improved overall performance and an increase in selling general and administrative expenses incurred by our hospital segment including approximately million of external costs associated with the triumph acquisition our provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses on a consolidated basis the provision for doubtful accounts decreased by million from million in to million in our hrs business decreased its provision by million in hrs recorded a

depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses skilled nursing rehabilitation services srs total srs costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased in compared to primarily due to an increase in therapist productivity and a decrease in selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses declined as a percentage of unit revenue primarily due to a reduction in labor and benefit costs as a percentage of revenue this was driven by therapist productivity improvements and lower contract labor usage in which more than offset the impact of wage rate and benefit cost increases improved therapist retention and a reduction in the time to fill permanent positions may have contributed to the decreased use of contract labor selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the cost savings achieved from the division and corporate realignment activities that were completed in the second half of depreciation and amortization expense decreased

triumphs hospitals generated operating profit of million or of revenue during the days we owned triumph in combined start up and ramp up losses declined from million in to million in the losses relate primarily to the start up of our ltach in peoria illinois and the ramp up of our ltach in kansas city we define the ramp up phase for an ltach as the period during which the hospital attempts to build its patient census following the receipt of its ltach medicare provider number selling general and administrative expenses increased from the prior year largely due to costs incurred for acquisition and joint venture development activities and an investment in back office resources to support the growth of the business in we incurred million of acquisition related expenses for outside costs directly related to the acquisition of triumph and another million of expenses for outside services related to other acquisition related activities in we incurred million of expense related to outside services for canceled acquisitions and joint venture development projects on january we adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations which requires us to expense all acquisition related costs prior to january outside service costs incurred for consummated transactions were capitalized as a component of the acquisition cost and only costs related to canceled transactions were expensed depreciation and amortization expense increased from to primarily due to depreciation and amortization associated with triumph and our other new facilities as a result of these factors the hospital segment incurred operating losses of million in and million in non operating items interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to the net increase in borrowings which occurred in connection with funding the november acquisition of triumph the balances outstanding on all forms of indebtedness were million and million at december and respectively interest expense

include phase which was sold in the second quarter of and a rehabilitation hospital located in midland texas which was sold in the third quarter of the company incurred an after tax loss of approximately million on the sale of phase in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries were million in both and the losses primarily relate to our hospitals in

assets divided by current liabilities of to net working capital increased by million to million at december as compared to million at december net accounts receivable were million at december compared to million at december the increase in net accounts receivable occurred primarily in our hospital segment and is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues in addition our peoria hospital recently received its ltach provider number and has retroactively billed medicare back to may including triumph the number of days sales outstanding dso in net receivables was and at december and respectively we generated cash from operations of million million and million in the years ended december and respectively capital expenditures were million million and million in the years ended december and respectively our capital expenditures primarily relate to the construction of new hospitals investments in information technology systems equipment additions and replacements and various other capital improvements over the next few years we plan to continue to invest in information technology systems and the development and renovation of hospitals as noted earlier triumphs results of operations have been included in our financial statements prospectively beginning after the date of acquisition we have historically financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities and long term debt instruments we believe our cash on hand cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital capital expenditures internal and external business expansion and debt service requirements on november we entered into a credit agreement as defined in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements the credit agreement provides for a five year revolving credit facility of million and a swingline subfacility of up to million at december the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million as of december we had million in letters of credit issued to insurance carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims the letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility as of december after consideration of the effects of restrictive covenants the available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was approximately million the credit agreement also provided for a six year million term loan facility at december the balance outstanding under the term loan was million the term loan facility requires quarterly installments of with the balance payable upon the final maturity in addition we are required to make mandatory principal prepayments equal to a portion of our consolidated excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement when our consolidated leverage ratio reaches certain levels the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that among other things limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness investments dividends transactions with affiliates asset sales acquisitions mergers and consolidations liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in similar credit facilities in addition we are required to maintain on a consolidated basis a maximum ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the credit agreement a maximum ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda and a minimum ratio of adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and operating lease expense adjusted ebitdar as defined in the credit agreement to fixed charges as of december we were in compliance with all debt covenants if we anticipate a potential covenant violation we would seek relief from our lenders however such relief might not be granted or might be granted on terms less favorable than those in our existing credit agreement in we issued shares of our common stock in a public equity offering which resulted in net proceeds after underwriting fees and other direct costs of approximately million we used the net proceeds from the public equity offering along with the proceeds from our term loan facility to pay for the majority of the consideration used to acquire triumph inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole our management contracts often provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to us by our clients based on increases in various inflation indices effect of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition which is incorporated herein by reference commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december in thousands less than more than total year years years years other operating leases purchase obligations long term debt including capital lease obligations interest on long term debt unrecognized tax benefits other long term liabilities total we lease many of our facilities under non cancelable operating leases in the normal course of business some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements for more information see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty the amount of long term debt reported on our consolidated balance sheet at december includes unamortized original issue discounts of approximately interest on our variable rate debt is estimated using the rate in effect as of december this line also includes interest related to capital lease obligations but excludes the amortization of original issue discounts and the amortization of deferred loan fees represents our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards codification topic income taxes there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities which involve various taxing authorities as a result we are unable to predict the timing of payments against this obligation we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees under the plan participants may defer up to of their salary and cash incentive compensation the amounts are held in trust in investments designated by participants but remain our property until distribution because most distributions of funds are tied to the termination of employment or retirement of participants we are not able to predict the timing of payments against this obligation at december we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include accounting for business combinations estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts estimating contractual allowances impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health workers compensation and professional liability claims in addition note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by rehabcare include customer contracts trade names and medicare provider numbers critical estimates in valuing these intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates the assets remaining economic life and future expected cash flows generated by the assets managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in our hospitals segment the primary collection risks relate to the amounts for which the patient is responsible deductibles and co payments our accounts receivable balance as of december was million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million our estimates of collectability require significant judgment if our customers ability to make payments to us were to deteriorate beyond the levels estimated additional allowances may be required we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified contractual allowances our hospitals recognize net patient revenue in the reporting period in which the services are performed based on our current billing rates less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances an individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payors following their review of each particular bill we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances using the balance sheet approach on an individual hospital basis patient accounts receivable detail is analyzed to determine expected reimbursement for each patient expected reimbursement is summarized by payor classification and reconciled to the balance sheet a secondary review is completed at the consolidated hospitals level to validate calculations estimates are regularly reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration medicare reimbursement rules and known changes to contract terms laws and regulations and payment history if such information indicates that our allowances are overstated or understated we reduce or provide for additional allowances as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination laws and regulations governing medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation as a result there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount the estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined we did not record any significant adjustments for prior year medicare or medicaid cost reports in or we are not aware of any material claims disputes or unsettled matters with third party payors goodwill and other intangible assets the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets both tangible and intangible based on estimated fair values costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired net of liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill under gaap goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value then an impairment loss should be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value no impairments of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives were identified during the three years ended december as required by gaap we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill by comparing the reporting units fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment our primary reporting units are our skilled nursing rehabilitation services hospital rehabilitation services and hospital businesses we calculated the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates these assumptions are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate however different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results a divestiture of a significant component of our business significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events in addition as our business or the way we manage our business changes our reporting units may also change these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could materially impact our reported earnings in the periods such charges occur at december unamortized goodwill related to our skilled nursing rehabilitation services hospital rehabilitation services and hospitals businesses was million million and million respectively we have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended december our most recent impairment test was performed as of december a decrease in the calculated fair value of each of our reporting units as of december would not have resulted in a potential goodwill impairment however for our hospitals reporting unit a decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit would have resulted in a potential goodwill impairment the amount of impairment loss if any would be determined during the second step of the impairment test health workers compensation and professional liability insurance accruals we maintain an accrual for our health workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets at december the combined amount of these accruals was approximately million we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends in analyzing the accruals we also consider the nature and severity of the claims analyses provided by third party claims administrators as well as current legal economic and regulatory factors if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals while we believe that the recorded amounts are appropriate there can be no assurances that changes to managements estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals from time to time and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us if we become aware of such claims against us we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary forward looking statements this annual report contains historical information as well as forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and relate to future events our future financial performance or our projected business results in some cases forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may will should expects plans anticipates believes estimates predicts targets potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements we caution investors that any such forward looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in our forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors while it is impossible to identify all such factors some of the factors that could impact our business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements are discussed in item a risk factors item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the companys primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on certain borrowings that bear interest at floating rates interest rate changes on variable rate debt impact our interest expense and cash flows but do not impact the fair value of the underlying debt instruments borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at either a base rate or the london interbank offering rate libor for one two three or six month interest periods or a nine or twelve month period if available plus an applicable margin percentage the base rate is the greater of the federal funds rate plus one half of bank of america nas prime rate or one month libor plus the applicable margin percentage is based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio as of december the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million and the interest rate on such borrowings was a basis point increase in the interest rate charged on the revolving credit facility would result in additional interest expense of approximately on an annualized basis borrowings under our term loan facility bear interest at our option at either the base rate plus basis points or libor plus basis points with a libor floor of basis points as of december the balance outstanding against the
