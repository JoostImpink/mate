item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the narrative description of our business in item of part i of our annual report on form k and our consolidated financial statements accompanying notes and other information listed in the accompanying financial table of contents overview we develop manufacture and market a broad line of innovative technologically enhanced pvc free and latex free urinary continence and urine drainage care products for patients who generally use such products at home a small percentage of our urological products also are used in the acute care market which generally includes hospitals and extended care treatment facilities through our recently acquired subsidiary laprolan bv we also sell certain ostomy and wound and scar care products and other brands of urological products into the european marketplace the primary purchasers of our products are distributors individual hospitals and healthcare institutions and extended care facilities we sell our products directly and through private label partners both in the domestic market and internationally international sales accounted for approximately and of total sales in the fiscal years ended september and respectively the urological products we manufacture include our silicone male external catheters mecs our standard and advanced lines of silicone and anti infection intermittent catheters and our femsoft insert through our fiscal year ended september we also manufactured standard and advanced lines of silicone and anti infection foley catheters for the acute care market in november we announced our decision to cease manufacturing and marketing foley catheters and will focus on our core product lines of mecs and intermittent catheters net sales of foley catheters were approximately million for fiscal representing approximately of our total net sales costs and expenses associated with manufacturing and marketing foley catheters are extensive and this product line had not yet reached a point of positive earnings contribution as such we estimate our decision to exit this business will significantly enhance our profitability we will continue to fulfill orders for foley catheters for up to days from announcement during which time we expect to deplete the majority of our remaining foley inventory we will continue to own the intellectual property associated with our foley catheters in anticipation of deriving additional value from those assets in the future direct sales include all our rochester medical branded sales script easy sales and all of our other sales at laprolan we market our products under our rochester medical brand through a direct sales force in the united states the united kingdom and the netherlands and through independent distributors in other international markets as part of our three year strategic business plan through fiscal we increased the level of investment in our sales and marketing programs in fiscal to support our direct sales growth in the us and europe through the addition of several members to our sales team as of september our us direct sales force consisted of members which has been reduced to members following our decision to exit the foley catheter business internationally we sell our rochester medical branded products in the united kingdom through a direct sales force of members and in the netherlands through a direct sales force of twelve members as of september respectively in the uk we also sell our rochester medical brand products and other companies products direct to the patient through the script easy program uk residents can call a toll free number and order products for direct home delivery upon verification of a prescription from a doctor in fiscal the script easy program contributed million of net sales compared to million in fiscal and is the vehicle where new intermittent catheter patients and femsoft patients in the uk are driven in the netherlands we have the exclusive rights to market a range of continence care ostomy and wound and scar care products of other medical device companies laprolan has been an importer and distributor of medical products since and markets its products and services exclusively to healthcare institutions physicians and specialty nurses on april we completed the acquisition of the outstanding capital stock of laprolan bv a table of contents corporation organized under the laws of the netherlands and a wholly owned subsidiary of fornix biosciences nv pursuant to a share purchase agreement we paid a cash purchase price at closing of euro us of which was paid for the cash balance of laprolan b on january and was interest paid to fornix from january until closing as provided in the share purchase agreement the transaction had a retroactive effective date of january and the operating results of laprolan b are for our account from and after january we have applied purchase accounting as of that date and have included the results of laprolan b in our financial statements beginning with the second quarter of our fiscal a significant portion of our net sales to date have depended on our ability to provide products that meet the requirements of medical product companies that resell or distribute our products and on the sales and marketing efforts of such entities private label sales arrangements with these entities are likely to continue to be a significant but declining percentage of our revenues in the future while we continue to establish our own market presence under the rochester medical brand name private label sales represented of total sales in fiscal compared to of total sales in fiscal increasing our percentage of direct sales versus private label sales over time will have a positive impact on our gross margin net sales for our fiscal year ended september were million an increase of million or from million in the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales resulted from an increase in direct sales for the fiscal year while private label sales increased for the fiscal year the increase in direct sales resulted from an increase in sales to the home care market in the united states and internationally as well as an increase in sales to the acute care market in the us offset by a decrease in acute care sales internationally home care direct sales accounted for of total direct sales for our fiscal year ended september our five largest customers in fiscal represented approximately of our total net sales because our larger customers typically purchase products in relatively large quantities at a time our financial performance can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon the timing of their purchases we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net sales in september the femsoft insert was approved for inclusion in part ix of the uk drug tariff as a prescription product that is reimbursable under the national healthcare system commencing in in november the cms issued a specific medicare reimbursement code which covers our femsoft insert in january the cms notified us of their decision regarding the medicare reimbursement fee to be used for the femsoft insert in response to our request that the pricing data used to establish the fee schedule be revised the current medicare fee schedule amount is based on price data that is closest to a base period and is significantly lower than the current retail price for the femsoft insert we continue to believe that the reimbursement fee is unreasonably low and we intend to continue to pursue a dialog with the cms in an effort to change the reimbursement rate we continue to believe the availability of national healthcare system and medicare reimbursement will help this unique device become an economically accessible and often preferred solution for incontinent women in the united kingdom and in the united states while it is still too early to know the full potential of this product in the marketplace management believes it can become an integral part of our product offering our manufacturing facilities which we own are located in stewartville minnesota and have been designed to accommodate the specialized requirements for the manufacture of medical devices including fda requirements for quality system regulation a substantial portion of the expenses associated with our manufacturing facilities are fixed in nature ie depreciation and will reduce our operating margin until such time as we are able to increase utilization of our capacity through increased sales of our products as of september we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million invested in marketable securities the marketable securities primarily consist of million invested in us treasury bills and million invested in cds our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and the value table of contents thereof could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates our investment choices however are conservative and are intended to reduce the risk of loss or any material impact on our financial condition our net income for fiscal was or per diluted share compared to a net loss of or per diluted share in fiscal the increase in net income for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from increased sales as well as reduced operating expenses incurred in the objective of our three year strategic plan that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal was to double our annual overall sales during the three fiscal years of the plan while also producing a significant increase in net income in the third fiscal year as part of that plan we increased the level of investment in our sales and marketing programs to support our direct sales growth in the us and europe through the addition of several members to our sales team with the increased investment expected to be funded primarily through cash generated from operations we recently updated our three year strategic plan primarily as a result of the discontinuation of our foley catheter line and to a lesser extent a more conservative assumption regarding international sales given the broader economic challenges in europe although we still expect significant growth in sales and improved net income as a result of our strategic plan and the higher level of profitability we expect to achieve following our exit of the foley catheter business management believes that the ongoing strategic effort to grow our rochester medical direct sales through increased investment in sales and marketing programs is providing positive results some quarter to quarter fluctuation in sales growth remains likely however through the term of the plan primarily due to the timing of large private label orders but we expect quarterly fluctuations in sales to diminish as private label sales represent a smaller percentage of total sales we will also continue to look for other strategic opportunities to increase our product line and distribution capabilities application of critical accounting policies managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an on going basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies among others affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements inventories inventories consisting of material labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market our policy is to establish an excess and obsolete reserve for our products in excess of the expected demand for such products at september this reserve was compared to at september if actual future demand or market conditions differ from those projected by us additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required these valuation adjustments would be included in cost of goods sold accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is calculated by a combination of specific account identification as well as percentages of past due balances at september this allowance was table of contents compared to at september if actual future collections or customer liquidity conditions differ from those projected by us additional receivables valuation adjustments may be required we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition we require prepayments by certain foreign customers receivables generally are due within to days revenue recognition we have standard contract terms with all non group purchase organization customers of fob shipping point as such sales are recognized upon shipment gpo customers have terms of fob destination per the agreement and thus sales are recognized upon delivery of goods to the customer revenue is recognized when title and risk of ownership have passed the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured for all gpo customer orders shipped within the last five working days of a quarter we monitor the shipping tracking number for such shipments to verify receipt by the customer if we are able to verify receipt by the customer by the end of the month the sale is recognized in that month payment terms for all customers range from prepayment to days customers cannot return unsold products unless we have authorized such return for warranty claims we warrant that the products we sell to our customers will conform to the description and specifications furnished by us and that the products will be free from defects in material and workmanship in the event of a warranty claim the customer is responsible for shipping the products back to us freight prepaid if the failure of the product is due to a breach of warranty we may repair or replace the defective products at our option and return the repaired or replaced products to the customer freight prepaid this is the limit of our warranty liability and this warranty is made in lieu of all other written or unwritten express or implied warranties historically due to the nature of use of our products and low replacement cost our warranty exposure has been immaterial other than our limited warranty obligation we do not have post shipment obligations to or acceptance provisions with our customers including our distributors income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states netherlands and the united kingdom based on estimates and assumptions we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized at september we recorded a valuation allowance of of which is related to minnesota rd credit and pertains to us federal capital loss carryovers as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be utilized in future years we have not recorded a valuation allowance on any other net deferred tax assets because there is sufficient future projected income to sustain that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be able to be utilized on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the requirements for a valuation allowance valuation of goodwill and other intangibles we follow accounting standards codification asc goodwill and other intangible assets when we acquire a company the purchase price is allocated as applicable between identifiable trademarks other intangible assets tangible assets and goodwill as required by us generally accepted accounting principles determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to the trademarks and other intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates the amount of the purchase price allocated to trademarks and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each trademark or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values the discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the acquired business we test annually for impairment of the asset currently on june st of each fiscal year for the goodwill table of contents associated with our uk acquisition and for the goodwill related to our netherlands acquisition we have determined the reporting unit continues to be at the enterprise level we apply a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis and on an interim basis if certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred by comparing the fair value of discounted cash flows for each reporting unit to its carrying value goodwill was approximately million as of september and finite life intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology patents and trademarks and are amortized using the straight line method as appropriate over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years all of our intangible assets are finite lived we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were million and million as of september and respectively long lived assets we follow asc property plant and equipment as such we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable long lived assets are considered not recoverable when the carrying amount of a long lived asset asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset asset group if it is determined that a long lived asset asset group is not recoverable an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset asset group over the long lived assets asset groups fair value fair value is the amount at which the long lived asset asset group could be bought or sold in a current transaction between a willing buyer and seller other than in a forced or liquidation sale stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc compensation stock compensation we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period total stock based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal year ended september was approximately after tax million pre tax see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation programs the estimated fair value of restricted shares is determined by the market price at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period of four years we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options as of the grant date the fair value of stock options under the black scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors risk free interest rate volatility of our stock price and expected dividends we use the intrinsic value method to estimate the value of restricted stock awards we analyze historical employee stock option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption we believe that historical data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option we also stratify our employee population based upon distinctive exercise behavior patterns the risk free interest rate we use is based on the yield on the grant date of a zero coupon us treasury bond whose maturity period equals or approximates the options expected term we calculate the expected volatility based solely on historical volatility which continues to be the most appropriate measure for us the dividend yield rate used is zero as we have not nor expect to pay dividends the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the expense associated with new awards in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period related to historical awards and could materially affect our net income and diluted net income per share of a future period there were no modifications to any of our plans in there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based awards on the grant dates as determined using the black scholes model may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise or forfeiture of those stock based awards in the future some employee stock options may expire without value or only realize minimal intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and recognized in our financial statements alternatively some employee stock options may realize significantly more value than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and recognized in our financial statements results of operations the following

care refers to non hospital sales fiscal year ended september compared to fiscal year ended september net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales resulted primarily from an increase in direct sales in the europe and middle east eme region and the us an increase in private label sales in the us offset by a slight decrease in eme private label sales the increase in direct sales resulted from an increase in home care sales in both the us and eme regions as well as modest increases in home care sales in the rest of the world row and acute care sales in the us offset by a slight decrease in acute care sales in the row and eme us direct sales increased by over last fiscal year our eme direct sales increased compared to last year led by a strong increase in the uk and twelve months of revenue from laprolan versus nine months of revenue the prior year management believes these results demonstrate the favorable impact of our strategic decision to increase investments in direct sales and marketing programs for our rochester medical branded products particularly for our advanced intermittent catheters which we believe will continue to drive growth in branded sales total net sales for the fiscal year were negatively affected by as a result of the stronger us dollar versus the pound sterling and the euro thereby affecting sales given the significant volume of our rochester medical branded product sales in the united kingdom and the netherlands direct sales in the row were flat compared to the same period last year private label sales were up table of contents from last year private label sales accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year we expect private label sales as a percentage of total sales to decline over time as we focus more on growing our direct sales gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal unchanged from fiscal increased sales and higher mix of lower margin products particularly new advanced intermittent catheters and foley catheters offset manufacturing efficiencies and increased sales of higher margin products particularly mecs management expects the sale of our new advanced intermittent catheters will continue to have a negative impact on margin until we are producing them at higher levels needed to achieve manufacturing efficiencies however the sale of laprolan products and our direct sales in both the us and eme should continue to have a positive impact on margin as we continue to focus on direct sales our exit from the foley catheter business should also have a positive impact on gross margin marketing and selling marketing and selling expense primarily includes costs associated with base salary paid to sales and marketing personnel sales commissions and travel and advertising expense marketing and selling expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal with marketing and selling expense of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in marketing and selling expense is primarily due to of decreased travel expenses of decreased

increases of in depreciation general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal and fiscal was and respectively interest income interest income decreased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year the decrease reflects overall lower interest rates on investments and lower cash available for investment following the payoff of our line of credit balance interest expense interest expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in interest expense reflects lower amounts of debt as a result of paying off the outstanding balance on our line of credit originally incurred to finance our acquisition of laprolan income taxes during the current fiscal year we utilized federal net operating losses nols of approximately and have approximately million remaining we have uk nol carry forwards as of september of approximately pounds sterling approximately for fiscal we have a valuation allowance of related to minnesota rd credit and us federal capital loss carryovers as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be utilized in future years we have not table of contents recorded a valuation allowance on any other net deferred tax assets because there is sufficient future projected income to sustain that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be able to be utilized for fiscal we had an effective tax rate of approximately resulting primarily from foreign operations incentive stock options and other permanent differences in future periods of taxable earnings we expect an effective tax rate in the range of net income loss for fiscal we reported a net income of compared to a net loss of in fiscal the increase in net income was primarily driven by increased sales resulting from our strategic investment in net sales and marketing programs and our focus on direct sales in home care markets as we executed on our three year strategic business plan fiscal year ended september compared to

increased by over last fiscal year our eme direct sales increased compared to last year led by a strong increase in both the uk and the netherlands in acute care sales of and home care sales of private label sales were down slightly in both the us and eme regions management believes these results demonstrate the favorable impact of our strategic decision to increase investments in direct sales and marketing programs for our rochester medical branded products additionally beginning with the quarter ended march direct sales include the sales of laprolan bv our recently acquired subsidiary in the netherlands total sales were partially strengthened as a result of the change in foreign currency exchange rates in the united kingdom as the us dollar was somewhat weaker versus the pound sterling thereby affecting sales positively given the significant volume of our rochester medical branded product sales in the united kingdom direct sales in the row increased slightly compared to the same period last year including an increase in acute care sales of offset by a decrease in home care sales of private label sales were down from last year private label sales accounted for

approximately million we had uk nol carry forwards as of september of approximately million pounds sterling approximately million for fiscal we recorded a valuation allowance of related to minnesota rd credit carryovers as we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be utilized in future years we did not record a valuation allowance on any other net deferred tax assets because there is sufficient future projected income to sustain that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be able to be utilized for fiscal we had an effective tax rate of approximately resulting primarily from foreign operations incentive stock options and a few adjustments having an effect on the tax rate these discrete adjustments included retroactive changes in deferred taxes as a result of a change in tax rates and recording a valuation allowance in the current year for minnesota rd credit carryovers the amount of these items in comparison to our net income for the current year results in a significant effect on our effective tax rate percentage net income loss for fiscal we reported a net loss of compared to a net loss of in fiscal the increase in net loss was primarily impacted by our increased investment in sales and marketing programs as contemplated by our three year strategic business plan and one time costs associated with the acquisition of laprolan liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities and have raised approximately million in net proceeds since our inception our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were million at september compared with million at september the decrease in cash primarily resulted from cash used for capital expenditures stock repurchases and debt repayments partially offset by cash provided by operations and from stock option exercises as of september we had million invested in marketable securities the marketable securities primarily consist of million invested in us treasury bills and million in cds our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and the value thereof could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates our investment choices however are conservative and are intended to reduce the risk of loss or any material impact on our financial condition table of contents we generated a net million of cash from operating activities during the year compared with million for the same period last year with the primary difference being positive net income and decreased levels of inventory offset by increased accounts receivable cash flow provided by operating activities in was comprised of net income of million decreased by an increase in net working capital components of million and increased by net non cash charges of million including depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million significant working capital changes are as follows a increase in accounts receivable reflecting timing of cash collections over prior year and sales growth a decrease in inventory levels a decrease in deferred income taxes a increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets a increase in accounts payable reflecting timing of payments and a increase in income taxes payable during fiscal our working capital position excluding cash and marketable securities increased by million as a result of the pay off of short term borrowings used to fund the acquisition of laprolan accounts receivable balances increased million during the fiscal year primarily due to growth in sales in the fourth quarter inventories as of september decreased million over fiscal changes in other asset and

fiscal financing activities primarily payments on short term debt and share repurchases used net cash of million in fiscal in june in conjunction with the asset purchase agreement with coloplast we entered into an unsecured loan note deed with coloplast with an outstanding principal amount of the promissory note was non interest bearing payable and due in five equal installments of payable annually on june we discounted the note at the final payment of was made in may in december we entered into a credit facility with rbc wealth management the credit facility consists of a revolving line of credit of up to with interest accruing monthly at a variable rate currently at in conjunction with the closing of the laprolan acquisition on april we drew down from the line of credit in january we used a portion of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and paid off our entire outstanding balance on our line of credit the borrowings under this credit facility are limited to the value of eligible assets held with rbc wealth management the credit facility now consists of a revolving line of credit of up to with interest accruing monthly at a variable rate of as of september as of september we had no outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit we currently believe that our existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future however our actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the costs method and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities the amount of revenues from sales of our existing and new products changes in termination of and the success of existing and new distribution arrangements the cost of maintaining enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights competing technological and market developments developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters the cost and progress of our research and development efforts opportunities for growth through acquisition joint venture or other business combinations if any and other factors our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on table of contents our operating and financial performance and is also subject to prevailing economic and financial conditions and to business and other factors beyond our control recently global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy failure or sale of various financial institutions a general tightening of credit and an unprecedented level of market intervention from the united states and other governments these events have adversely affected the us and world economy and may adversely affect the availability and cost of financing in the event that additional financing is needed we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing collaborative relationships or other arrangements any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders and debt financing if available may involve significant restrictive covenants collaborative arrangements if necessary to raise additional funds may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our
