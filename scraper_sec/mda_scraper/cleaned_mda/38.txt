we develop market sell and support a software platform and framework for enterprise content and business process management this platform called filenet p provides a flexible and scaleable framework for developing solutions that provide our customers with the ability to manage content throughout their organizations and streamline their business processes enterprise content management ecm refers to the broad range of functions used by organizations of all types including businesses and governmental agencies to control and track the information or content that is important to the organizations operations whether that information is used internally such as sales contracts or product diagrams or externally such as content provided to customers through a web site the content our software manages commonly called unstructured content includes but is not limited to web pages word processing documents spreadsheets html xml pdf document images email messages and other electronic content our software offers customers the ability to configure design build and deploy ecm solutions to meet the needs of their particular business or organization we generate revenue by selling software licenses delivering implementation and education services and by providing technical support to our customers software revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing of our software products to our customers implementation and education services are sold on a fee for service basis and technical support and software maintenance are provided pursuant to service contracts annual fees for software technical support and software maintenance are received in advance and recognized as revenue over the duration of the contract earnings results are highly sensitive to fluctuations in revenue due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of our cost structure facilities and employee compensation and benefits related expenses are fixed in nature and represent approximately of our cost structure our future profitability is contingent upon revenue growth achieved through continued investments in internally developed or acquired software technologies that produce earnings at a higher rate than fixed cost increases software the filenet p architecture provides our customers with enterprise level software that is scalable and flexible to handle demanding content challenges and manage complex business processes the filenet p architecture provides a framework for functional expansion to provide enhanced content and process management across an enterprise through product suites each emphasizing a different aspect of the ecm solution set with functions grouped in a logical order that are designed to meet a customers individual ecm needs each suite can be implemented individually but remains expandable to include all filenet content and process management capabilities solutions and applications built by third party partners or our customers on filenet p software are designed to manage content allowing organizations to capture create use and activate that content in order to make decisions faster and bring control and consistency to business processes to improve efficiency and address compliance requirements we license our ecm software to companies in the financial services government insurance manufacturing telecommunications and utilities industries both directly to the end user and through partners the growth in our software license revenue is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions as well as the competitive position of our software products long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions that can substantially affect our operating results characterize our enterprise software business we believe we are well positioned to grow our revenue through our software products that address our current and prospective customers content management and business process improvement requirements including improved regulatory compliance the ability to meet regulatory and compliance requirements has become increasingly critical for large public enterprises in order to maintain proper documentation for all key transactions however we believe software revenue will continue to be affected by future economic conditions customer support we offer product support on a global basis to provide post sales services to ensure successful implementation of our products and customer satisfaction our support offering also includes right to new versions when and if available our customer service and support organization provides comprehensive support capabilities including electronic and real time phone support and global call tracking for customers and partners on support programs system engineers deliver support coverage on multiple platforms with hour call handling our web site offers the ability to open cases search our knowledge base and review related status reports our customers typically purchase support at the time they acquire new software licenses and renew their software license support contracts annually provided their systems are still in service the growth of support revenue is influenced by the renewal rate of the existing base and the amount of new support contracts associated with the sale of new software licenses we believe that our customer support revenue will continue to grow as we sell new software licenses and our customers continue to renew their product support contracts professional services and education our worldwide professional services organization provides consulting implementation development and other technical services and training services to our licensed customers and authorized valuenet partners these services are provided through in house employees and a network of qualified service providers with trained contractors that are hired on a fee for service basis our professional services organization offers a comprehensive methodology to help our customers design install integrate customize and deploy our products these services include implementations of our products billed on a time and material basis as well as short term fixed price services such as software installation and implementation packages but do not include modifications to the standard software our educational curriculum includes training courses for end users application developers and system administrators through media based and instructor led training at our global education centers onsite or through elearning the purpose of our education services is to allow our customers to further enhance the usability of our software products throughout their enterprise and to ensure a thorough understanding of the full functionality of our software products research and development we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development through internal and third party development activities third party licensing agreements and through technology acquisitions our research and development efforts focus on our enterprise content management capabilities in relation to platform capabilities and feature improvements to enhance our customers ability to configure design build and deploy a variety of ecm and bpm solutions in order to meet a broad range of content management and business process management needs within a scalable platform additionally we license third party software that is designed to expand our product offerings and the functionality of our products through a variety of agreements with the producers of this software we expect research and development to remain a significant portion of our cost structure in critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of filenet are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition valuation of intangible assets reserves for bad debt and sales returns and income taxes we base our estimates on historical and projected results that we believe are reasonable these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and by their nature are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty actual amounts could differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position the significant accounting policies we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the nature of our business commonly includes multiple elements in our arrangements and requires us to make judgments for determining the timing and the amount of revenue to recognize these judgments include but are not limited to determining the allocation of revenue in multiple element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence and determining the creditworthiness of a customer to assess the probability of collection of a transaction we derive revenue from the following sources software which includes software licenses customer support revenues which include annual maintenance agreements and professional services which include consulting implementation and training services the provisions of statement of position sop no software revenue recognition issued by the american institute of certified public accountants governs the basis for our software revenue recognition accordingly software license revenue is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software we deliver the products customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and collection is probable we must make judgments and estimates to determine whether or not the certainty of these elements has been met our software license arrangements often include multiple elements that consist of software post contract customer support agreements and professional services such as consulting implementation and training we recognize revenue in multiple element arrangements using the residual method of revenue recognition in accordance with sop under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met if evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist all revenue from the arrangement is recognized when evidence of fair value is determined or when all elements of the arrangement are delivered vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for customer support is determined by reference to the price our customers pay for such support when sold separately that is the renewal rates paid by our customers revenue from customer support contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement which is typically months vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the established pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately historically we have been able to establish vsoe for customer support and professional services but we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes in or the inability to support vsoe of fair value for these undelivered elements if this occurs our future revenue recognition for multi element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results a majority of our professional service revenue is derived from time and materials based contracts that typically range from three months to one year in duration revenue is recognized on such contracts as time is incurred and approved by the customer we also provide fixed price pre packaged services that are one month or less in duration revenue from such short term fixed price contracts is recognized upon completion of the work and customer acceptance short term fixed price contracts of a repetitive nature are more readily estimable than long term contracts our ability to make judgments about revenue and cost for these types of contracts has in the past been accurate we have little exposure to cost overruns in professional services engagements as any additional services are pre approved by our customers in time and material contracts and our fixed price contracts are normally very short term in nature and highly estimable we use judgment in assessing whether fees are fixed and determinable and probable of collection at the time of sale since customers who have previously deployed our products somewhere within their enterprise comprise approximately of software sales our ability to assess the credit worthiness of a transaction is supported by the collection history we have with that customer in the past our ability to judge the probability of collection has been highly accurate and we expect that this will continue our standard payment terms range from net to net days payments that are due within days are deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements to the extent we elect to provide extended payment terms beyond days for competitive or other reasons revenue is recognized when the amounts become due historically sales returns and bad debt write offs have been insignificant and within managements expectations however any adverse changes in these trends could impact the timing of revenue recognition in the future in addition to direct customer sales we sell through third party channel partners our channel partners do not inventory our software products rather shipments are made only when the partner places an order for a specific end user we require our channel partners to provide us with the name and address of all end users at the time an order is placed and in many cases we ship our products directly to the end user software license revenue from channel partners is recognized when an end user is identified product is delivered either to a channel partner or to their designated end user and all other revenue recognition criteria are met as our channel partners only purchase our product for specific end users we are not subject to channel inventory returns or price protection issues allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful we perform an initial evaluation of the creditworthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment and we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customers current creditworthiness we monitor collections from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses that is based on historical experience and on specific customer collection issues while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established in our financial statements we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past our accounts receivable are derived from sales to a wide variety of customers we do not believe a change in liquidity of any one customer or our inability to collect from any one customer would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position even though we have large transactions these tend to be with large well capitalized and credit worthy customers we also maintain a sales returns allowance based on historical return rates while we are not legally required to accept sales returns we have done so on certain occasions for our customers product returns have historically been minimal and within our expectations if we elect to accept a higher level of returns in the future for customer relations or other reasons our results of operations could be materially affected if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts or if estimates do not properly reflect future returns then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and results of operations in that period could be materially affected goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recorded at cost and is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually and would be written down if impairment were determined effective the first day of july of each year goodwill is tested for impairment by determining if the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note we also periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred in between annual testing dates that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable we performed an impairment analysis as of july in accordance with sfas the results indicated there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the three reporting units as of december there have been no indicators of impairment therefore no interim impairment tests have been performed identified intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization these assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of two to five years the determination of useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves judgment long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we evaluate these assets for impairment based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from these assets if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows a loss would be recorded for the excess of the assets carrying value over the fair value while we have not experienced impairment of intangible assets in prior periods we cannot guarantee that there will not be impairment in the future determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units future events such as a significant decrease in our revenue profitability or market capitalization or a change in technology could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions are impaired any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations income taxes we exercise significant judgment in determining our income tax provision due to transactions credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final tax determination could differ from our recorded income tax provision and accruals in such case we would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known these adjustments could have a material impact on our income tax provision and our net income for that period we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in we concluded that the valuation allowance associated with domestic net operating losses nols and other temporary differences exclusive of nols related to stock option deductions should be fully reversed as a result of the cumulative domestic profits in recent years and future domestic projections however we could be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income fail to benefit from our tax planning strategies or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible increases in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and our net income in the current year we determined that it is more likely than not that all or a significant portion of the deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset future taxable income based on current year and future domestic projections therefore the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million related to nols for stock option deductions was reversed and recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity in the current year results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated december revenue software

of revenue trends with additional explanation is contained below in each revenue component discussion total revenue growth is dependent upon continued software revenue growth and a continued high renewal rate of maintenance contracts to support our installed base revenue by geography the following table sets forth total revenue in thousands by geography and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated revenue by geography year ended december percent change percent change total united states revenue europe middle east africa asia pacific canada other total international revenue total revenue revenue as a of total revenue united states revenue international revenue total revenue contribution market acceptance of filenet p products better sales execution continued penetration into our installed base and additions to our product offerings accounted for the growth in all our geographic markets international revenue increased steadily for the past three years as a result of our efforts to expand our contribution from these markets through increased marketing programs targeted in those regions along with product development to enhance localization requirements the europe middle east africa emea region is our largest international market contributing approximately of our international revenue in all three years presented asia pacific is a much smaller market for filenet but produced overall revenue growth of from to we have made and will continue to make investments in the asia pacific region we expect international revenue to continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue however international revenues will be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens against certain major international currencies especially the euro or if international economic conditions weaken revenue by reporting segment the following table sets forth total revenue in thousands by reporting segment and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated revenue by reporting segment year ended december percent change percent change revenue software customer support professional services education total revenue revenue as a of total revenue ppt percentage point software ppt ppt customer support ppt ppt professional services education ppt ppt total revenue contribution software software revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing of our software products to our customers and partners software revenue increased by in compared to and by in compared to we attribute the growth in software revenue to a stable climate for it spending continued market acceptance of our filenet p products and growth in our product offerings since the announcement of filenet p products in we have expanded the filenet p platform and offerings through acquisitions licensing of third party products and development of added features and functionality our extensive product offerings allow us to address the broader demands within our installed base at an enterprise level rather than a point solution level this gives us cross selling opportunities to further serve our installed base of customers for the years presented approximately of software revenue came from our installed base in the future we believe our installed base will continue to expand their use of our products throughout their enterprise beyond the department or division level we also believe the it spending environment has improved during the past three fiscal years the result of our expanded filenet p offerings with improved it spending has increased the size of our software deployments within our customer base we believe these trends will continue in with a moderate but steady demand for enterprise content management and business process management software as large enterprises look for software that automates content used in key business applications and helps solve regulatory and compliance requirements related to managing content customer support customer support revenue consists of revenue from software maintenance contracts and time and material billings for services outside the terms of maintenance contracts support contracts entitle our customers to receive technical support bug fixes and upgrades to new versions of software releases when and if available customer support revenue is generated from maintenance contracts for current year software sales and from the renewal of existing maintenance contracts for previously sold software licenses on installed systems customer support revenue increased by in compared to and by in compared to these increases in customer support revenue reflect an increase in our overall customer installed base from new sales combined with a high rate of renewal in the existing customer base we have historically experienced a high contract maintenance renewal rate in excess of and continue to see a high level of renewal as our installed base grows the renewal rate has a larger influence on customer support revenue growth than current software revenue growth therefore the growth rate of customer support revenue does not necessarily correlate directly to the growth rate of new software license revenue in a given period this is substantiated by the slower growth in customer support revenue in compared to the growth rate in previous years we believe we will continue to experience a high rate of renewal on support contracts as our customers tend to deploy mission critical applications using our software to manage content while we do not expect our maintenance renewal rates to deteriorate if they were to decline materially our maintenance revenue and total revenue would likely decline materially as well professional services and education professional services and education revenue is earned by providing consulting services to customers for the design implementation deployment upgrade and migration of our software products technical consulting services provided to our resellers and training services no modifications are made to our standard base product code once the software has been sold professional services are usually performed on a time and material basis and are also generated from short term fixed price packaged services professional services and education revenue increased by in compared to and increased by in compared to professional services and education revenue is dependent on the level and the nature of software sales particularly new customer sales software sales that are characterized by repeat purchases for additional software licenses generate smaller engagements fewer implementations and a lesser need for customer training classes professional services and education revenue increased in resulting from increased package revenue and short term projects stemming from filenet p products that were introduced in and gained momentum in customers continued to transition to filenet p in resulting in comparable revenue to that of approximately of software sales in the years presented has been from our installed base this base has substantial in house knowledge of our products which results in less demand for our services in addition we have placed more emphasis on growing our partner business to provide large scale professional services to our customers rather than expanding our own internal resources we believe we will experience a moderate increase in professional services and education revenue in based on the number of new products that have been announced that will require professional services for implementation and education services for training on these new products dependency on new system sales to generate the professional services and education demand from our customers will continue cost of revenue cost of revenue by reporting segment the following table sets forth total cost of revenue by reporting segment in thousands and as a percentage of

software the cost of software revenue as a percentage of software revenue decreased percentage points from in to in resulting from lower costs and growth in revenue in absolute dollars the decrease was million or the mix of products containing third party software primarily determines fluctuation in third party fees for each of the three years presented from to royalty expense and other fees decreased by million amortization included in software cost of revenue was in in and in amortization expense for acquired technology from our october yaletown acquisition will add approximately million to the cost of software in going forward we anticipate cost of software revenue to range between of revenue future acquisitions resulting in additional acquired technology and future integration of additional third party technology with our products will result in increased software cost but we would expect such increase to be offset by increased revenue customer support the cost of customer support revenue includes the cost of customer support personnel facility and technology infrastructure expenses in our call centers the cost of customer support revenue as a percentage of customer support revenue increased percentage points from in to in from to cost of customer support revenue as a percentage of customer support revenue decreased percentage points from to these minor percentage changes in cost are the result of controlled spending that have increased proportionally with revenue increases and are comparable for all the years presented approximately of customer support costs are personnel related expenses that have increased in absolute dollars due to salary and benefits increases rather than any significant headcount increases customer support headcount has ranged from employees in to in we expect the cost of customer support revenue to range between of customer support revenue for the near future as long as customer support revenue continues to grow at a higher rate than costs we believe the current cost structure with a small increase in the number of personnel in the customer support organization will be sufficient to support projected revenue professional services and education cost of professional services and education revenue consists of the costs of professional services personnel training personnel and third party contractors we have a pool of qualified service providers represented by approximately companies with trained contractors the cost of professional services and education revenue as a percentage of professional services and education revenue increased percentage points from in to in from to the cost of professional services and education revenue as a percent of professional services and education revenue decreased percentage points from to the increase in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily due to increased third party contractor expense of million to accommodate increased revenue headcount was flat at for both and with compensation and benefits remaining flat as well the increase in cost from to resulted from increased third party contractor expense of million to support revenue growth partially offset by decreased facility and depreciation expense of million along with cost control in a number of expense areas together with our pool of service providers we believe our headcount in the professional services and education segment allows for revenue growth without adding significant additional resources we expect professional services and education costs as a percentage of professional services and education revenue to range between in the near term assuming professional services and education revenue continues to grow operating expenses total operating expenses the

been reclassified to operating expense to conform to the current years presentation research and development our research and development efforts focus on platform capabilities and on feature improvements to our product suites through both internal and third party development resources and by obtaining third party technology to enhance product capabilities through licensing agreements and acquisitions we use third party development resources in india and china for product localization and selected development we have also historically acquired companies to obtain their technology note during we acquired yaletown technology group inc to provide additional technology and expertise to address the compliance market during we acquired shana corporation to integrate their electronic forms capabilities into our products our research and development expense consists of personnel costs for software developers third party contracted development efforts and related facilities costs research and development expense as a percent of revenue decreased by percentage points from in to in and decreased by percentage points from in to in increased revenue in all three years contributed to the decrease in research and development expenses as a percent of revenue along with fairly consistent personnel and compensation expense these costs account for approximately of research and development expense research and development expense in absolute dollars decreased million from to and increased million from to the decrease in is attributable to compensation and benefit decreases of million due to timing and mix of headcount fluctuations during the year along with decreases in depreciation and facilities of million the increase in is attributable to our expanded third party development program with contractors in india which represented a million expense increase that was partially offset by reduced compensation expense of million in north america we intend to continue to complement internal development with third party development as well as with third party software through oem agreements and may execute additional technology acquisitions over time we believe we will be able to lower our per developer cost through the use of third party resources and plan to modestly increase these resources when appropriate we believe that research and development expenditures including compensation of technical personnel are essential to maintaining our competitive position we expect research and development expense to range between of revenue assuming revenue growth in the near term and will gradually decrease on a percentage basis as revenue increases selling and marketing we sell our products through a direct sales force and our indirect channel sales partners our selling and marketing expense consists of salaries benefits sales commissions and other expenses related to the direct and indirect sales force and personnel cost for marketing and market development programs selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenue decreased percentage points from in to in from to selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased percentage points increased revenue in over with comparable expenses for these two years contributed to the lower percentage in absolute dollars sales and marketing expense was essentially unchanged for and reflecting overall cost control the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars of million from to resulted from personnel related expenses including salaries and benefits that increased million year over year due to a higher salary mix despite a reduction in headcount higher total revenue in resulted in incremental commission expense of million in compared to additionally travel expense increased million in compared to due to a new sales coverage model where resources were deployed by account rather than geography and due to generally higher business activity this resulted in increased travel both in volume and distances we expect selling and marketing expense to range between of revenue in the near term depending on revenue growth general and administrative our general and administrative expense consists of salaries benefits and other expenses related to personnel costs for finance information technology legal human resources and general management and the cost of outside professional services general and administrative expense decreased by in compared to and increased by in compared to in absolute dollars general and administrative expense was essentially unchanged for and reflecting overall cost control the million increase in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily attributable to increased personnel expense of million that included merit increases to compensation increased variable compensation and the addition of restricted stock expense increased consulting expense and accounting fees of million associated with our efforts to achieve compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act by december also contributed to the increase in we expect general and administrative expense to range between of total revenue in the near term depending on revenue growth purchased in process research and development our yaletown acquisition in october resulted in an allocation of million to in process research and development there were no acquisitions during and there was no in process research and development expense associated with our april acquisition of shana the yaletown allocation was determined by management through established valuation techniques in the high technology industry with the assistance of an independent third party appraiser in process research and development was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments other income net of other expenses was million in million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to an increase in interest income of million based on increased cash cash equivalents and investment amounts earning interest at a higher weighted average interest rate partially offset by a lower net foreign exchange gain of million the increase in from of million was primarily attributable to increased interest income of million resulting from increased cash cash equivalents and investment amounts earning interest at a higher weighted average interest rate the weighted average interest rate earned on cash cash equivalents and investments was in in and in provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in compared to a benefit for income taxes of million in and a provision of million in the effective tax rate was and for the years ended december and respectively the increased tax rate in was due to i the mix of income earned by domestic operations versus the foreign subsidiaries and ii the benefit received from the valuation allowance reversal in in the future we expect our on going effective tax rate to range between these rates however can fluctuate outside our expectations depending upon the mix of our profits between domestic and lower taxed foreign locations quarterly results of operations quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected by a variety of factors including the timing of large enterprise transactions seasonality of economic activity in europe and to some degree the timing of budget approvals in the government sector historically the fourth quarter is our highest quarter and we expect these trends to continue in the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information presented in thousands except per share amounts for our last eight fiscal quarters this information has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustments which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with

earnings per share liquidity and capital resources as of december cash and cash equivalents and investments were million an increase of million from million at december cash cash equivalents and investments include million in the united states and million held by our foreign subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents consist of high quality and highly liquid investments in short term money market funds united states government agency discount notes and corporate notes cash equivalent investments include commercial paper corporate and government securities with original maturities of days or less short term investments include investment instruments with maturities of greater than days and less than days as well as auction rate securities that reset interest rates at auction intervals ranging from or days long term investments consist of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities greater than months and less than three years these securities are classified as available for sale and are consequently recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized holding gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our major sources of cash as more fully discussed below have been cash generated from operations and cash provided by financing activities cash flows from operations were million in million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was million in million in and million in for the three years presented we have been profitable and net income has been a primary source of cash from operating activities net income grew to million in from million in and million in depreciation and amortization added to net income to provide cash from operating activities although the amount has declined each year due to tight budgetary control over capital spending this results in lower depreciation expense as the asset base declines depreciation and amortization was million in million in and million in our cash from operations is also impacted by changes in working capital accounts changes in accounts receivable and unearned revenue have typically had the largest impact on our cash flows the days sales outstanding metric which is calculated by dividing year end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the fourth quarter was days days and days as of december and respectively this metric fluctuates due to timing of revenue and collections and is well within our expectations the higher balance in accounts receivable at december accounted for decreased cash of million from operating activities we attempt to structure our sales contracts to require a majority of payments in days or less and all payments in days or less to the extent that competitive pressures require us to extend our terms it would result in an increase to our days sales outstanding and a decrease to our operating cash flows our annual customer support agreements are typically prepaid at the beginning of the support period resulting in a large cash increase and a corresponding increase in deferred revenue this has historically resulted in significant cash increases in the first quarter when the largest portion of our support agreements renews we expect this trend to continue in the future net cash provided by investing activities in was million compared to net cash used for investing activities of million in and million in capital spending has accounted for net cash used of million in million in and million in we do not expect capital expenditure levels in to increase significantly from the level of significant changes in cash from investing activities have resulted from the purchase and sale of investments and from cash paid for acquisitions excess cash from operations is invested in high quality debt instruments and securities and the timing of purchases and maturities of investments results in significant short term fluctuations in net cash used or generated from investing activities we expect to continue to invest excess cash however based on the nature of our investment policy all such investments are available in the short term if needed for any reason net cash provided by financing activities results from the proceeds of common stock related to employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans as previously noted the cash generated from this activity was million in million in and million in stock prices favorably influenced this activity as long as our stock price is greater than the exercise price of outstanding stock options we expect to continue to generate cash from option exercises the effect of exchange rate changes on assets and liabilities of non us dollar subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment where that local currency is the functional currency are translated to u s dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are directly recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the euro and other currencies weakened against the us dollar throughout resulting in decreased cash when cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies were translated into us dollars the reverse of this occurred in and with a net cash increase resulting from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies against the dollar we have no borrowing arrangements as of december we believe that our present cash balances together with internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months see item a risk factors commitments we lease certain of our facilities under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through we have certain royalty commitments associated with licensing of third party products that require minimum payments or contractual prepayments we have contract commitments associated with third party development agreements the following table summarizes future minimum payments for these obligations as of december in thousands payments due by period total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases third party licensing contracts third party development contracts total contractual cash obligations we have bank guarantees issued in local currencies in europe and asia as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following table summarizes future minimum commercial commitments for these obligations as of december in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed thereafter secured and unsecured bank guarantees other matters environmental matters we are not aware of any issues related to environmental matters that have or are expected to have a material effect on our business inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on the price of our products the cost of our materials or our operating results for any of the three years ended december impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued statement no revised sfas r share based payment which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards based on the grant date fair value of the award the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period we adopted the provisions of sfas r on january using a modified prospective application under the modified prospective application sfas r applies to new awards unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date and any awards that are subsequently modified or cancelled compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date are recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas note stock based compensation we adopted the black scholes methodology for valuing option prices that will be applied prospectively beginning january as a result of the provisions of sfas r we estimate the compensation charges under sfas r will reduce operating income by approximately to million however this estimate will be affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective variables such as the volatility of our stock price employee stock option exercise behaviors and future grants in march the fasb issued interpretation no accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations which addresses certain aspects of sfas no accounting for asset retirement obligations the interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of a conditional asset interpretation no is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december the adoption of interpretation no had no impact on our consolidated financial statements in may the fasb issued sfas no accounting changes and error corrections which replaces apb no accounting changes and sfas no reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle previously most voluntary changes in accounting principle were required to be recognized with a cumulative effect adjustment in net income of the period of the change sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change when it is impracticable to determine the effects of the change the new accounting principle must be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and a corresponding adjustment must be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of the change the new principle must be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december however the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio we place our investments with high quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default market and reinvestment risk our investments in marketable securities consist of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than three years investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents we classify all of our investments as available for sale available for sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported in a separate component of stockholders equity average maturity of our investment portfolio is approximately months therefore the movement of interest rates should not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement at any time a significant increasedecrease in interest rates will have an impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december and using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve which are representative of historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables held constant the analysis is based on the weighted average maturity of our investments as of december and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately at december and approximately at december similarly a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investments of approximately at december and approximately at december the following table provides information about our investment portfolio at december in thousands debt securities cost unrealized loss estimated fair value due in one year or less corporate governmentsagencies short term munis total due in one year due in one to three years corporate governmentagencies short term munis total due in one to three years grand total actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuer of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities we classify short term investments in current assets as all such investments are available for current operations foreign currency fluctuations our performance can be affected by changes in foreign currency values relative to the us dollar in relation to our revenue and operating expenses we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts in an effort to hedge against the effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant entity mainly in europe and asia pacific we have not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are included in other income in the consolidated statements of income and offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the revaluation of intercompany balances or other current assets investments or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity our forward contracts have an original maturity of three months all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market value at the end of each month as of december the fair value of the forward contracts outstanding was a liability of approximately cumulative other comprehensive income decreased by million in due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar since the euro comprised the majority of foreign currency balances on the balance sheet unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses resulted largely from this fluctuation in the euro against the us dollar cumulative other comprehensive income increased with a gain of million in and a gain of million in due to unrealized foreign currency translation gains resulting primarily from the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar during those years
