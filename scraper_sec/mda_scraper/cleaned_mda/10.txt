item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands of dollars except for per share information introduction and overview this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the operating performance and financial condition of keithley instruments inc a discussion of our business including our strategy for growth products and competition is included in part i of this form k business overview our business is to design develop manufacture and market complex electronic instruments and systems geared to the specialized needs of engineers at electronics manufacturers and academic institutions for research product development high performance production testing and process monitoring our primary products are integrated systems used to source measure connect control or communicate electrical direct current dc and alternating current ac signals our product offerings include integrated systems solutions along with instruments and data acquisition modules that can be used as system components or stand alone solutions our customers are engineers technicians and scientists in manufacturing product development and research functions during fiscal approximately percent of our orders were received from the semiconductor industry approximately five percent came from the wireless communications customer group approximately percent came from the precision electronics customer group which includes customers in automotive computers and peripherals medical equipment aerospace and defense and manufacturers of components and approximately percent came from research and education customers the remainder of orders came from customers in a variety of other industries although our products vary in capability sophistication use size and price they generally test measure and analyze electrical optical or physical properties as such we consider our business to be in a single industry segment the most important factors influencing our ability to grow revenue are i our customers spending patterns as they invest in new capacity or upgrade manufacturing lines for new product offerings ii our ability to offer interrelated products with differentiated value that solve our customers most compelling test challenges and iii our success in penetrating key accounts with our globally deployed sales and service team we continue to believe that our strategy of pursuing a focused set of applications will allow us to grow faster than the overall test and measurement industry many of the industries we serve including the semiconductor wireless communications and precision electronic components industries have historically been very cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns followed by periods of secular growth our customers across all industries and geographies demonstrated reduced order patterns beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through mid fiscal year in response to these conditions we took various cost reduction actions beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through the first quarter of fiscal to reduce our future operating expenses these actions included headcount reductions a hiring freeze with the exception of a few critical replacements reductions in our capital expenditures and travel and other discretionary spending a pay reduction for the majority of us exempt employees and unpaid days off for us non exempt employees the suspension of the annual bonus program for management and lower sales commissions payments to the sales force the suspension of the companys k match and the exit of our s series product line in addition we sold substantially all of the assets related to our rf product line global semiconductor device sales have now exceeded levels achieved just prior to the financial crisis that began in the fall of calendar and we have experienced sequential increases in orders from our customers since the second quarter of fiscal because of that improvement coupled with the previous cost reduction measures that are still in place effective january we restored compensation levels and work hours for us exempt and non exempt employees respectively reinstated the companys k match and recorded variable costs for both annual and long term incentive plans the company recorded approximately of expense during fiscal year as a result of the aforementioned costs our focus during the past several years has continued to center on building long term relationships and strong collaborative partnerships with our global customers to serve their measurement needs toward that end we rely primarily upon employing our own sales personnel to sell our products and using sales representatives to whom we pay a commission in areas where we believe it is not cost beneficial to employ our own people this sales channel strategy allows us to build a sales network of focused highly trained sales engineers who specialize in measurement expertise and problem solving for customers and enhances our ability to sell our products to customers with worldwide operations we believe our ability to serve our customers has been strongly enhanced by deploying our own employees throughout the united states europe and asia as a substantial portion of our selling costs are fixed we expect that selling through our own sales force will be favorable to earnings during times of strong sales but will be unfavorable during times of depressed sales table of contents we continue to believe that both the semiconductor and wireless areas drive change within the electronics industry these technology changes create many opportunities for us and we continued the introduction of new products and enhancements during fiscal our research and education customers work involves advanced materials research in areas including nanotechnology organic materials and thin film research these materials are ultimately used in the next generation of semiconductors and cutting edge electronic devices additionally our semiconductor customers include large integrated device manufacturers and foundries fabless manufacturers as well as solar cell developers we believe these customers will continue to generate demand because they continually are improving existing devices or developing new devices that in turn create new measurement requirements on december the company completed the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement pursuant to which aegean acquisition corp was merged into the company and each outstanding common share and class b common share of the company was converted into the right to receive per share in cash also pursuant to the merger agreement all outstanding stock options restricted award units and performance award units were at the time of closing fully vested and cancelled in exchange for the merger consideration of for each underlying common share less any exercise price per share critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the companys critical accounting policies these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring at a specific point in time events which will be settled in the future use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the reported financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates revenue recognition keithley instruments inc recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have been met when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer upon shipment a provision is made for estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties and sales returns revenue earned from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual service periods and is not material to the companys consolidated results shipping and handling costs are recorded as cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is determined based on a currently adjusted standard which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis we periodically review our recorded inventory and estimate a reserve for obsolete or slow moving items if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional reserves may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated our cost of sales will be lower than expected in that period income taxes keithley is subject to taxation from federal state and international jurisdictions the annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of judgment by management judgment also is applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part in evaluating our ability to recover our net deferred tax assets which totaled at september we considered all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income in determining future taxable income we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of pretax operating income in each tax jurisdiction the reversal of book versus tax differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business table of contents we have established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets including net operating losses or nols in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions which may not be realized due to the uncertainty of future profit levels in the respective jurisdictions we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance until such nols are utilized or until such nols expire our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance the realization of certain tax credits and the remaining deferred tax asset is dependent upon achieving future forecasted taxable income if actual results are significantly less than our forecast an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the remaining net deferred tax assets which totaled at september an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a material impact on our future earnings and financial position in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in various tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues based upon our estimate of whether additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine that the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge of income tax expense would result pension plans our retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and their related obligations will inherently be settled far in future periods therefore the ultimate amount of those obligations is subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year because the assumption regarding the rate of return on plan assets is a long term estimate it can differ materially from the actual return realized on plan assets in any given year particularly when markets are highly volatile we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that the rates we use are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are in place as well as the plans asset allocation between equities and fixed income investments assumed discount rates are used in measurements of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost see note h to consolidated financial statements for further details the discount rate for the united states plan was determined as of the september measurement date by constructing a portfolio of bonds with cash flows from coupon payments and maturities matching the projected benefit payments under the plan bonds considered in constructing the model portfolio are rated aa or higher by standard poors callable bonds were excluded from consideration in this analysis the longest maturity of any bond included in the data is august benefit payments beyond were discounted back to this year using interest rates taken from the citigroup pension discount curve comparison to above median as of september the matching bond portfolio produces coupon income in excess of what is needed to meet early period benefit payments the excess coupon income is accumulated as interest based on the citigroup pension discount curve comparison to above median as of september until such time as it is used to pay benefits the discount rates used in determining the recorded liability as of year end for our united states pension plan were for for and for the and basis point decrease from to and to respectively reflects the decline in interest rates stemming from the global economic crisis that began in late fiscal and continued in fiscal this situation pushed bond yields lower than previous levels the discount rates for our german pension plan were for for and for the decrease in the fiscal rate reflects the reduction in yields for corporate bonds during the year the slight increase in the fiscal rate reflects the change in spread between government and highly rated corporate bond yields for euro instruments having durations similar to the german pension liability actual rate of return on united states plan assets was for fiscal compared to an expected rate of return of a increase decrease in the expected rate of return would have produced a decrease increase in fiscal expense table of contents the pension plan assets in germany are invested through an insurance company the insurance company directs the investments for this insurance contract because of the type of investments in the insurance contract an expected rate of return of was assumed management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions for both the united states plan and the non us plans based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by us gaap and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate pension income or expense is allocated to cost of goods sold selling general and administrative expenses and product development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations stock compensation plans we grant non cash compensation in the form of non qualified stock options performance award units and restricted share units in accordance with us gaap the company is required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant the company applies the black scholes option pricing model inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility option life risk free interest rate and dividend yield while risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions typically based on factual data derived from public sources the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates we use an expected stock price volatility assumption primarily based upon observed historical volatility of keithleys stock price as there is not a substantial enough market for exchange traded options for stock options granted during fiscal year we used a stock price volatility assumption of with regard to the weighted average expected option life assumption we consider several factors including the historical option exercise behavior of our employees historical cancellation rates of past options and the current life of options outstanding and vested during fiscal year we used an expected life assumption of years we also are required to estimate an expected forfeiture rate when recognizing compensation cost we review this rate during each reporting period and adjust it when necessary based upon our past history of actual forfeitures the total estimated unrecognized compensation at september was and was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years the final number of common shares to be issued pursuant to the performance award units is determined at the end of each three year performance period the awards granted in fiscal year vested on september the performance criteria related to these awards were met and resulted in a payout at percent of target in november for those awards measured on return on assets additionally it was determined that the subset of these awards measured on return on invested capital achieved a payout at percent of target and were issued accordingly in november the awards granted in fiscal year could be adjusted in percent increments and ranged from a maximum of twice the initial award as specified in the agreement to a minimum of zero units depending upon the level of attainment of performance thresholds during fiscal we recorded expenses of relating to the awards we granted no performance award units during fiscal during fiscal the company granted performance award units to officers and key employees the performance award unit agreements provide for the award of performance units with each unit representing the right to receive one of the companys common shares to be issued after the applicable award period the final number of units awarded for this grant was to be determined as of september based upon the companys total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the russell microcap index and could range from a minimum of no units to a maximum of twice the initial award the weighted average fair value for these performance units was and was determined using a monte carlo simulation model incorporating the following assumptions risk free interest rate volatility the company recognizes the estimated cost of these awards as determined under the simulation model over the performance period with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period during fiscal we recorded expenses of relating to the awards our future earnings can fluctuate throughout the performance period specified in the agreements depending upon our estimate of the number of awards we expect will be issued upon the completion of the performance period restructuring and cost reduction programs we expense costs associated with exit and disposal activities designed to restructure operations and reduce ongoing costs of operations when we incur the related liabilities or when other triggering events occur after the appropriate level of management having the authority approves the detailed cost reduction or restructuring plan we establish accruals for underlying activities by estimating employee termination costs our estimates are based upon factors including affected employees length of service any statutory requirements contract provisions salary level and health care benefit choices as part of our assessment of exit and disposal activities we also analyze the carrying value of any affected long lived assets for impairment and reductions in the estimated useful lives we believe our estimates and assumptions used to calculate the costs associated with these restructuring provisions are appropriate and although we do not anticipate significant changes actual costs could differ from the estimates should we make changes to the nature or timing of the plans table of contents results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data included in item of this annual report percent of net sales for the years ended september net sales cost of goods sold inventory write off and accelerated depreciation for exit of product line gross profit selling general and administrative expenses product development expenses gain on the sale of rf product line gain on the sale of building severance and related charges operating income loss investment income interest expense transaction costs associated with pending merger impairment of long term investments earnings loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss we recorded net income of or per diluted share for fiscal and net losses of or per diluted share for fiscal and or per diluted share for fiscal net sales were in compared with in and in the percent increase in sales in was substantially driven by stronger customer demand including demand for production related applications as well as an increase in large dollar orders compared the prior year the weak worldwide economic conditions that began during the latter part of fiscal intensified considerably in the first quarter of as the us financial markets froze and persisted throughout the duration of fiscal as global markets reacted and responded our customers responded with reduced demand in fiscal for products in all industries and all geographic regions served on a relative basis demand in fiscal for products used in research and development declined from fiscal levels less significantly than demand for products used in production for our customers in each of the semiconductor wireless and precision electronics industries geographically fiscal sales increased percent in the americas percent in asia and percent in europe all as compared to our respective results for fiscal sales declined percent in the americas percent in asia and likewise fell percent in europe all as compared to our respective results the effect of a weaker us dollar positively impacted sales growth by approximately one percentage point in fiscal and four percentage points in fiscal the stronger us dollar negatively affected sales by two percentage points in fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was and in and respectively the decrease in costs as a percentage of sales in was driven by the increase in sales volumes favorable product mix and lower manufacturing costs primarily as a result of the various cost cutting measures undertaken in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal the increase in costs as a percentage of sales in was driven by the lower sales volumes that were not fully offset by these cost cutting measures during we exited our s product line and as a result recorded of charges for inventory write offs and accelerated depreciation on related production equipment foreign exchange hedging had a minimal effect on cost of goods sold in and table of contents selling general and administrative expenses of declined or three percent in as compared to levels and decreased or percent in from in the decrease in over was the result of cost reductions put in place in offset by the restoration of employee compensation to full levels beginning january and the reinstatement of the k match retroactive to january as well as in fiscal of stock based compensation expense for performance based stock awards that were previously not expected to payout the sharp decline in was principally attributable to worldwide headcount reductions and other concerted cost containment measures which began in september and continued throughout the entirety of fiscal additionally we recorded reversals of during fiscal for previously accrued performance based stock awards that either did not vest during fiscal or were no longer expected to vest due to the poor financial performance product development expenses of in decreased percent from in and decreased percent in from in the decline from to was attributable to targeted reductions in spending coupled with headcount reduction related to the sale of the rf product line the decline from to was attributable to targeted reductions in spending coupled with headcount reductions in response to lower customer demand as well as the aforementioned exit of the s product line during fiscal we recorded for the gain on the sale of substantially all of the companys rf assets to agilent additionally we recorded for the gain on the sale of a facility located on bainbridge road in solon ohio during fiscal no such gains were realized during fiscal or during we recorded of income for the reversal of previously accrued expenses related to the severance and related charges in we recorded expenses of for costs associated with severance and related charges compared to expenses of in for costs associated with the first reduction in our global workforce see note k for further discussion investment income was in in and in the reduction from levels was driven mostly by a more conservative investment portfolio comprised principally of certificates of deposits and money market funds the reduction from levels was driven mostly by lower average cash and investment levels coupled with a more conservative investment portfolio comprised principally of certificates of deposits and money market funds see note d for further details interest expense was in in and in during fiscal we recorded for transaction costs associated with the pending merger with danaher these costs were incurred primarily for legal fees and strategic advisory expenses the effective tax rate for fiscal including discrete items was two percent and was lower than the us statutory rate primarily because we recognized income in the us with no corresponding tax expense as a result of fully reserved tax assets and benefited from the carryback of the net operating losses generated in fiscal we also recorded tax expense on certain profitable foreign jurisdictions see note j for further discussion the effective tax rate for fiscal including discrete items was percent and was substantially driven by a valuation allowance of recorded in the first quarter against us deferred tax assets as well as of tax expense on a us loss without tax benefit we also recorded tax expense on certain profitable foreign jurisdictions see note j for further discussion the effective tax rate for fiscal including discrete items was a benefit of percent the effective benefit in was greater than the us statutory rate due to the recognition of current year research tax credits state and local tax benefits and the recognition of benefits associated with prior year adjustments these benefits were partially offset by the net impact of losses in foreign jurisdiction which are not available for a tax benefit and us tax on foreign remittances see note j for further discussion our financial results are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations generally a weakening us dollar versus foreign currency favorably impacts our foreign currency denominated sales a strengthening us dollar has an unfavorable effect this foreign exchange effect cannot be precisely isolated since many other factors affect our foreign sales and earnings these factors include product offerings and pricing policies of keithley and our competition whether competition is foreign or us based changes in technology product and customer mix and local and worldwide economic conditions we utilize hedging techniques designed to mitigate the short term effect of exchange rate fluctuations on operations and balance sheet positions by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts we do not speculate in foreign currencies or derivative financial instruments and hedging techniques do not increase our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations table of contents financial condition liquidity and capital resources working capital the following table summarizes working capital as of september current assets cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments refundable income taxes accounts receivable and other net total inventories deferred income taxes other current assets total current assets current liabilities short term debt accounts payable accrued payroll and related expenses other accrued expenses income taxes payable total current liabilities working capital working capital increased during fiscal year by substantially driven by a increase in current assets from september the increase in current assets was caused by the combined effect of increase in cash and cash equivalents driven primarily by operating activities and proceeds from the sale of the rf product line and bainbridge road facility in solon ohio of more short term investments and of higher accounts receivable resulting from increased customer sales current liabilities increased from to by the increased levels in current liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in accrued employee incentives and sales commissions sources and uses of cash the following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities was in fiscal year compared to cash used in operations of for fiscal year cash from operating activities is net income loss adjusted for certain non cash expenses and changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year operating cash flows resulted primarily from a net income of offset by an increase in accounts receivable deferred income taxes and the gain on the sale of assets and respectively and augmented by non cash charges from depreciation stock based compensation and accrued employee incentives we also made a contribution to our us pension plan during fiscal the net use of cash in operating activities stemmed primarily from the net loss which was not fully offset by non cash charges and reductions in working capital we also made of voluntary contributions to our us pension plan during fiscal year operating cash flows resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts receivable and the positive impact of non cash charges from depreciation stock based compensation and assets impairment charges this was partially offset by non cash charges for deferred taxes an increase in inventory and in contributions to the companys us pension plan in fiscal table of contents investing activities cash provided by investing activities was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the sale of assets related to the rf product line and the bainbridge facility the purchase and sale of investments and purchases of property plant and equipment capital spending declined to in from in as we curtailed spending in response to the difficult economic conditions experienced throughout the prior year in the company had proceeds from the sale of assets totaling this was comprised of the completed sale of the rf product line assets to agilent for a cash purchase price of and for the sale of the companys bainbridge facility we purchased of short term investments in fiscal year versus in fiscal year while sales of short term investments generated in cash in fiscal versus last year as a result during fiscal we increased investments due to an increase in overall cash by compared to liquidating approximately of investments to provide cash for operations and other activities in fiscal year the increase in these investment activities directly relate to the improved operational performance in fiscal year compared to fiscal year additionally in fiscal year we used in connection with pledges against outstanding letters of credit as required under our existing credit arrangement see note e for details financing activities cash used for financing activities in fiscal year was versus in fiscal year during fiscal year we repurchased of our common shares compared to in fiscal year see note c for further details cash dividends in fiscal year of were comparable with the incurred in fiscal year the company amended its credit agreement in march the revised facility consisted of a debt facility outstanding at september that provided unsecured multi currency revolving credit at various interest rates based on prime or libor the agreement did not contain debt covenants but required cash to be pledged against outstanding borrowings and stand by letters of credit we were required to pay a facility fee of per annum on the total amount of the commitment the expiration date had been extended to march but the credit agreement was terminated on december the company had a number of other such credit facilities in various currencies and for standby letters of credit aggregating outstanding at september at september we had total unused lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks aggregating see note e for further details under certain provisions of the former debt agreement we were required to comply with various financial ratios and covenants our stock repurchase program expired on february and was not renewed or replaced accordingly we have been unable to repurchase common shares since such date see note c for more details during we expect to finance capital spending and working capital requirements with cash and short term investments on hand and cash provided by operations set forth below is a table of information with respect to the companys contractual obligations as of september payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years short term debt operating lease obligations a payments under deferred compensation agreements b pension benefits c c c c non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual obligations a agilent assumed the santa rosa lease associated with the rf product line however the company remains a guarantor in the event of default agilent will indemnify the company for any amounts paid by the company to the landlord in event of any default accordingly obligations of approximately and under that lease are not included in the above table as they are not expected to be incurred by the company for fiscal and respectively b includes amounts due under deferred compensation agreements with current and former employees at september investment in insurance assets to fund future deferred compensation payments were amounts exclude additional interest and investment gains or losses that may be earned or incurred from september through the time of payment c the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of september the company made a voluntary pension contribution of in fiscal and a contribution was made in october to satisfy the requirement for fiscal no further contributions are anticipated we are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans including interest rate levels the amount and timing of asset returns what if any changes may occur in legislation and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements recently adopted accounting pronouncements in february the fasb issued guidance which allows companies to choose at specified election dates to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after november the company adopted the guidance effective october and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements in march the fasb issued updates to guidance amending and expanding the disclosure requirements related to the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities to provide improved transparency into the uses and financial statement impact of derivative instruments and hedging activities the new disclosure provisions were adopted by the company in the second quarter of fiscal see

force abstracts the guidance is not intended to change or alter existing us gaap the guidance became effective for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal adoption did not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in may the fasb issued authoritative guidance which establishes general standards for accounting and disclosure of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to issuance of the financial statements the guidance is not intended to result in significant change to current practice the company adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal adoption did not have an effect on its consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in september the fasb issued guidance that requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end the company adopted the presentation requirements of the guidance in fiscal which resulted in a net charge to other comprehensive income of we adopted the measurement date provisions in fiscal and as a result recorded a charge of to retained earnings see note h for additional information related to the change in measurement date provisions in september the fasb issued authoritative guidance which established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements the guidance is applicable to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements accordingly the guidance did not require any new fair value measurements however for some entities the application changed current practice the guidance became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november and interim periods within those fiscal years however the fasb provided a one year deferral for the implementation for nonfinancial assets and liabilities the company adopted the guidance effective october except with respect to nonfinancial assets and liabilities and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements the company adopted the guidance related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective october which resulted in expanded disclosures in its consolidated financial statements in january the fasb issued updates to the guidance that is

issued asu updates to guidance that address disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses the new guidance amends asc topic and is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal the company is currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks including foreign currency fluctuations interest rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its short term investments in the normal course of business we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rates the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through transactions denominated in foreign currencies we currently utilize foreign exchange forward contracts or option contracts to sell foreign currencies to fix the exchange rates related to near term sales and effectively fix our margins generally these contracts have maturities of three months or less our policy is to only enter into derivative transactions when we have an identifiable exposure to risk thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk in our opinion a percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments nor therefore on our results of operations financial position or cash flows the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting primarily of various money market funds and certificates of deposit cds with numerous institutions and differing maturity dates a decline in interest rates would generally not change the value of these investments as they mature but would decrease earnings on future cds purchased with cash or proceeds from other matured cds during fiscal the amount of short term investments has increased in terms of both dollars and as a percentage of total current assets however in managements opinion a percent decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows table of contents
