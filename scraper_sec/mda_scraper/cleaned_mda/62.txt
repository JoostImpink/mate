item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with financial statements and supplementary data in item of this annual report the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report see forward looking statements below overview we are one of the worlds largest offshore drilling contractors as of february we operated a fleet of rigs consisting of five deepwater drillships semisubmersible rigs seven independent leg jackups and two managed deepwater drilling rigs we also have two deepwater drillships under construction our customers include major integrated oil and natural gas companies state owned national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas companies our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling services to smaller companies focused on more specific geographic or technological areas our primary strategic focus is on ownership and operation of floating offshore rigs particularly deepwater rigs although crude oil prices have declined from the record levels reached in mid they have maintained a trading range in excess of per barrel since august averaging approximately per barrel in with a high closing price per barrel of in december the market for deepwater drilling services remains uncertain in the near term due especially to continued concern stemming from the global recession and the moratorium on offshore drilling in the us gulf of mexico in however we believe the long term prospects for deepwater drilling are positive given the expected growth in oil consumption from developing nations limited growth in crude oil supplies and high depletion rates of mature oil fields together with geologic successes improving access to promising offshore areas and new more efficient technologies including enhanced reservoir recovery techniques since we have invested or committed to invest over billion in the expansion of our deepwater fleet including five new ultra deepwater drillships three of which were delivered in the first and third quarters of and the first quarter of and two of which are under construction with expected delivery dates in the fourth quarter of and third quarter of the three new drillships that have been delivered have multi year contracts at favorable rates since we also have disposed of non core assets generating billion in proceeds enabling us to focus increasingly our financial and human capital on deepwater drilling with the tendency for deepwater drilling programs to be more insulated from short term commodity price fluctuations we expect that the deepwater market will outperform other offshore drilling market sectors over the long term in addition an increasing focus on deepwater prospects by national oil companies whose exploration and production spending is less sensitive to general economic factors serve to provide further stability in the deepwater sector however the macondo well incident and its consequences as discussed further below have increased the near term uncertainty in the sector our contract backlog at december totaled billion and was comprised primarily of contracts for our deepwater rigs awarded by large integrated oil and national oil companies recent developments proposed merger with ensco on february we entered into a merger agreement with ensco plc and two of its subsidiaries pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to the conditions provided in the agreement we will merge with one of the subsidiaries and become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ensco the combination will create the industrys second largest offshore drilling fleet as a result of the merger each outstanding share of our common stock other than shares of our common stock held by ensco us or any of enscos or our wholly owned subsidiaries which will be cancelled as a result of the merger those shares with respect to which appraisal rights under delaware law are properly exercised and not withdrawn and other shares held by certain uk residents if determined by ensco will be converted into the right to receive in cash and american depositary shares representing class a ordinary shares of ensco under certain circumstances uk residents may receive all cash consideration as a result of compliance with legal requirements table of contents we have agreed to various covenants under the merger agreement and the closing of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information about the terms of the transaction our covenants under the merger agreement and the conditions to consummation of the transaction as well as the financing commitments relating to the transaction please also read risk factors included in item a of part i of this annual report for more information regarding risks relating to the transaction drillships construction projects on december we entered into an agreement for the construction of a fifth new advanced capability ultra deepwater drillship the new drillship is based on a samsung heavy industries proprietary hull design the rig is designed for drilling in water depths of up to feet with a total vertical drilling depth of feet we believe the rigs design and capabilities which includes a dual derrick will allow for numerous well construction and field development activities that can be performed in parallel producing increased rig efficiencies following shipyard construction commissioning and testing the drillship is expected to be delivered to us at the shipyard in mid the agreement provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of million subject to adjustment for delayed delivery payable in installments during the construction process we have the right to rescind the agreement for delays exceeding certain periods and for failure of the drillship to meet certain operating requirements or alternatively the right to liquidated damages for such delays or failures we expect the total project cost including commissioning and testing to be approximately million excluding capitalized interest the agreement also includes an option for a second unit at similar terms and conditions which may be exercised by us during the first quarter of in addition we have an agreement for the construction of the ultra deepwater drillship the deep ocean molokai the deep ocean molokai has a scheduled delivery date in the fourth quarter of including amounts already paid and commissioning and testing we expect total project cost to be approximately million excluding capitalized interest through december we have spent approximately million on this project although we currently do not have drilling contracts for the deep ocean molokai or our fifth ultra deepwater drillship we expect that the long term demand for deepwater drilling capacity in established and emerging basins should provide us with opportunities to contract these two rigs prior to their delivery dates there are risks of delay and cost overruns inherent in any major shipyard project including those resulting from adverse weather conditions work stoppages disputes and financial and other difficulties encountered by the shipyard in order to mitigate some of these risks we have selected a high quality shipyard with a reputation for on time completions in addition our construction contracts are based on a fixed fee backed by a refund guarantee if the unit is ultimately not finished or accepted by us upon completion deliveries by the shipyard beyond a certain point in time are subject to penalty payments and cancellation we also believe that constructing a drilling rig at a single shipyard presents a lower risk profile than projects that call for construction in multiple phases at separate shipyards although some risks are more concentrated recently delivered drillships on january we took delivery of our third new ultra deepwater drillship the deep ocean mendocino the deep ocean mendocino is currently in transit to the us gulf of mexico where it is expected to commence a five year contract with a subsidiary of petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras during the second quarter of following completion of integrated testing and acceptance by the client on february we took delivery of the deep ocean ascension the first of our new ultra deepwater drillships under construction the drillship arrived in the us gulf of mexico in may and has completed its acceptance testing with bp exploration production inc bp ep the rig was originally intended for drilling operations in the us gulf of mexico however due to the moratorium on drilling in the us gulf of mexico and more recently to regulatory changes that have created delays and uncertainty regarding the resumption of drilling in the us gulf of mexico discussed below under us gulf of mexico bp ep was unable to commence drilling operations with the deep ocean ascension in the region according to its original schedule in the third quarter of bp ep agreed to place the deep ocean ascension on a special standby dayrate of the special standby dayrate is effective from august until the earlier of april or the date the rig begins mobilization to its first drilling site either within or outside the us gulf of mexico the deep ocean ascension is expected to mobilize to the mediterranean sea in the second quarter of table of contents on september we took delivery of our second new ultra deepwater drillship the deep ocean clarion the drillship is currently in the process of finalizing the integrated acceptance testing program with bp ep in the us gulf of mexico the originally intended location for drilling operations due to delays and uncertainty regarding the resumption of drilling in the us gulf of mexico discussed below under us gulf of mexico in february bp ep agreed to place the deep ocean clarion on a special standby dayrate of prior to the startup of the previously agreed five year contract the special standby dayrate will commence upon the earlier of completion of acceptance testing or march and will continue until the earlier of the completion of certain customer requested modifications and upgrades or july the deep ocean clarion is expected to mobilize to a region outside of the us gulf of mexico no later than july bp ep owns a working interest and is the operator of the exploration well associated with the macondo well incident discussed below while we currently expect bp ep to perform its obligations under the drilling contracts for the deep ocean ascension and the deep ocean clarion we cannot predict what actions bp ep might attempt to take under the contracts or whether it ultimately will be able to perform its obligations in light of the incident and resulting spill our contracts with bp ep do not include a written parent company guarantee bp ep may choose to exercise either contracts termination for convenience clause under which bp ep would be required to provide a make whole payment to us that approximates the present value of the cash margin that would have been earned over the life of the contract if bp ep fails to perform under the contracts the drillships could be idle for an extended period of time in that case our revenues and profitability could be materially reduced if we are unable to secure new contracts on substantially similar terms or at all amendment of revolving credit facility and issuance and redemption of senior notes on july we entered into an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that increased availability under the facility from million to million and extended the maturity from december to july on october pursuant to the credit facilitys accordion feature we increased the availability under the facility to million on august we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem on september our entire outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due at a price of of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date we have used and expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes which have included and may include payments with respect to our drillships under construction and other capital expenditures us gulf of mexico in response to the april macondo well incident in the us gulf of mexico the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement of the us department of the interior boem at the time known as the minerals management service implemented a moratorium on certain drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico until november in october the secretary of the interior directed the boem to lift the moratorium subject to certain specified conditions during the pendency of the moratorium the boem implemented various environmental technological and safety measures intended to improve offshore safety systems and environmental protection the newly issued safety regulations require operators to among other things submit independent third party reports on the design and operation of blowout preventers bops and other well control systems and conduct tests on the functionality of well control systems additional regulations address new standards for certain equipment involved in the construction of offshore wells especially bops and require operators to implement and enforce a safety and environmental management system including regular third party audits of safety procedures and drilling equipment to insure that offshore rig personnel and equipment remain in compliance with the new regulations prior to the resumption of drilling following the moratorium each operator is required to demonstrate that it has in place written and enforceable procedures pursuant to applicable regulations that ensure containment in the event of a deepwater blowout we cannot currently predict the rate at which new well permits will be issued or the rate at which rigs will be allowed to return to work once compliance with the new regulations has been demonstrated we believe however that the process followed by the boem to review and approve a well permit application by our clients will continue to be protracted relative to past experience resulting in significant delays in the resumption of drilling in deepwater us gulf of mexico that could persist through table of contents the us gulf of mexico represents one of three established deepwater drilling basins in the world and currently accounts for more than of the industrys deepwater rig capacity the region is a vital contributor to the economy in the united states providing strong hydrocarbon production growth potential and significant employment opportunities despite the economic importance of the region the deepwater drilling moratorium and the significant delays in receiving drilling permits following the deepwater drilling moratorium and implementation of new regulations and offshore procedures has created significant uncertainty regarding the outlook for the region and possible implications for regions outside of the us gulf of mexico due to such uncertainty some contract drillers and operators with floating rigs located in the region may choose to relocate the units to other international drilling areas through january five of the floating rigs operating in the us gulf of mexico at the time of the incident have secured new drilling assignments and have relocated or will relocate to international locations should there continue to be significant delays in the issuance of drilling permits or in allowing rigs to operate upon demonstration of compliance with new regulations or should additional regulations and government oversight operating procedures and the possibility of increased legal liability be viewed by our clients as a significant impairment to expected economic returns on projects in the region additional floating rigs could depart the us gulf of mexico with fewer clients operating in the region as a result a more challenging business environment could develop in the international sector characterized by increased supply of rig capacity and declining dayrates in addition to the various environmental technological and safety measures implemented during the pendency of the moratorium we believe the us government is likely to issue additional safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the us gulf of mexico and may take other steps that could delay operations increase the cost of operations or reduce the area of operations for drilling rigs other governments could take similar actions additional governmental regulations concerning licensing taxation equipment specifications and crew training and competency requirements could increase the costs of our operations generally we would seek to pass increased operating costs to our customers through cost escalation or change in law provisions in existing contracts or through higher dayrates on new contracts where appropriate additionally increased costs for our customers operations along with permitting delays could affect the economics of currently planned and future exploration and development activity especially in the us gulf of mexico and reduce demand for our services furthermore due to the macondo well incident and resulting spill insurance costs across the industry could increase and certain insurance may be less available or not available at all which could apply to our fleet the newly issued drilling equipment and safety requirements have imposed higher standards and could reduce the number of floating rigs capable of operating in the us gulf of mexico the operating limitation if any should be most evident in the industrys lower specification units which possess dated technology and operating equipment we believe that the advanced technical features and equipment configuration already present in our five newbuild drillships will result in these units being substantially compliant with the newly issued safety requirements and would satisfy any new equipment specification guidelines without significant modifications which could establish them as a preferred drilling asset by clients except as described above under recently delivered drillships and below under segment review other operations we do not currently have any rigs operating in the us gulf of mexico seahawk spin off and subsequent bankruptcy filing on august we completed the spin off of seahawk which holds the assets and liabilities that were associated with our mat supported jackup rig business in the spin off our stockholders received approximately million shares of the outstanding common stock of seahawk by way of a pro rata stock dividend each of our stockholders of record at the close of business on august received one share of seahawk common stock for every shares of our common stock held by such stockholder and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of seahawk common stock to which such stockholder otherwise would have been entitled in connection with the spin off we made a cash contribution to seahawk of approximately million to achieve a targeted working capital for seahawk as of may of million we and seahawk also agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities that may arise or be incurred in the future attributable to our respective businesses in february seahawk and several of its affiliates filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy filings we were listed as seahawks largest unsecured creditor with a contingent disputed and unliquidated claim in the amount of approximately million the debt was listed as a trade payable subject to setoff the seahawk debtors filed motions to sell substantially all of their assets and to obtain debtor in possession financing the purchaser in the asset sale is proposed to be hercules offshore inc and its affiliate sd drilling llc which will pay base aggregate consideration consisting of approximately million in cash and shares of hercules common stock prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy seahawk indicated an intention to seek among other things i to reject its outstanding contracts with us thereby replacing seahawks future performance obligations under the contracts with general unsecured claims in the bankruptcy ii to seek a judicial determination or estimation of all of our claims against seahawk including indemnity claims and contract damage claims and iii to set off claims seahawk alleges it is owed for spin off transition and other matters against all amounts currently payable from seahawk to us in respect of transition services and rig management services and to seek to recover any positive balance after such netting in addition the bankruptcy laws permit a debtor in bankruptcy under certain circumstances to challenge pre bankruptcy payments or transfers of the debtors assets if the debtor received less than reasonably equivalent value while insolvent or if the transfers were made with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud a creditor or were made while insolvent on account of a pre existing debt that has the effect of preferring the transferee over the debtors other creditors during the so called preference period authorized representatives of the bankruptcy estate could seek to challenge transactions effected in connection with the spin off under the bankruptcy laws table of contents in and seahawk received tax assessments from the mexican government related to the operations of certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to local statutory requirements seahawk has provided and may provide additional surety bonds letters of credit or other suitable collateral to contest these assessments pursuant to a tax support agreement between us and seahawk we agreed at seahawks request to guarantee or indemnify the issuer of any such surety bonds letters of credit or other collateral issued for seahawks account in respect of such mexican tax assessments made prior to the spin off date on september seahawk requested that we provide credit support for four letters of credit issued for the appeals of four of seahawks tax assessments the amount of the request totaled approximately million based on exchange rates as of december on october we provided credit support in satisfaction of this request pursuant to the tax support agreement seahawk is required to pay us a fee based on the actual credit support provided seahawks quarterly fee payment due on december was not made which had the effect of terminating our obligation to provide further credit support under the tax support agreement further on february we sent a notice to seahawk requesting that they provide cash collateral for the credit support that we previously provided on their behalf as provided under the terms of the agreement in connection with its bankruptcy filing seahawk is seeking to terminate its reimbursement obligations under the tax support agreement if certain of seahawks claims and requests were granted the adverse effect on us could be material we cannot currently predict what actions may be taken by the bankruptcy court or other creditors or stakeholders of seahawk in connection with the proceeding or the effect the actions may have on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows fcpa investigation we have resolved with the us department of justice and the securities and exchange commission our previously disclosed investigations into potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act in connection with the settlements in the fourth quarter of we paid a total of million in penalties disgorgement and interest as described below we had accrued this amount in the fourth quarter of the settlement with the doj included a deferred prosecution agreement dpa between us and the doj and a guilty plea by our french subsidiary pride forasol sas to fcpa related charges under the dpa the doj agreed to defer the prosecution of certain fcpa related charges against us and agreed not to bring any further criminal or civil charges against us or any of our subsidiaries related to either any of the conduct set forth in the statement of facts attached to the dpa or any other information we disclosed to the doj prior to the execution of the dpa we agreed among other things to continue to cooperate with the doj to continue to review and maintain our anti bribery compliance program and to submit to the doj three annual written reports regarding our progress and experience in maintaining and as appropriate enhancing our compliance policies and procedures if we comply with the terms of the dpa the deferred charges against us will be dismissed with prejudice if during the term of the dpa the doj determines that we have committed a felony under federal law provided deliberately false information or otherwise breached the dpa we could be subject to prosecution and penalties for any criminal violation of which the doj has knowledge including the deferred charges in december pursuant to a plea agreement pride forasol sas pled guilty in us district court to conspiracy and fcpa charges pride forasol sas was sentenced to pay a criminal fine of million and to serve a three year term of organizational probation the sec investigation was resolved in november without admitting or denying the allegations in a civil complaint filed by the sec we consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement plus pre judgment interest totaling million and a permanent injunction against future violations of the fcpa table of contents we have received preliminary inquiries from governmental authorities of certain of the countries referenced in our settlements with the doj and sec we could face additional fines sanctions and other penalties from authorities in these and other relevant foreign jurisdictions including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets at this early stage of such inquiries we are unable to determine what if any legal liability may result our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests we could also face other third party claims by directors officers employees affiliates advisors attorneys agents stockholders debt holders or other interest holders or constituents of our company for additional information regarding a stockholder demand letter and derivative cases with respect to these matters please see the discussion under demand letter and derivative cases in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report in addition disclosure of the subject matter of the investigations and settlements could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets no amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines sanctions claims or other penalties referenced in this paragraph which could be material individually or in the aggregate we cannot currently predict what if any actions may be taken by any other applicable government or other authorities or our customers or other third parties or the effect the actions may have on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on our consolidated financial statements or on our business in the countries at issue and other jurisdictions in addition in connection with the investigation our former chief operating officer resigned as an officer effective may and remained in the capacity of an employee to assist us with the investigation and to be available for consultation and to answer questions relating to our business he had agreed to retire upon the conclusion of the investigation and his right to receive retirement benefits was subject to the determination by our board of directors that we did not have cause as defined in his retirement agreement with us to terminate his employment the board of directors recently determined that we did not have requisite cause to terminate his employment and that his retirement date was december our business we provide contract drilling services to major integrated government owned and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world our drilling fleet competes on a global basis as offshore rigs generally are highly mobile and may be moved from one region to another in response to demand while the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary somewhat between regions significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility key factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a contract include pricing safety records and competency rig availability location and technical ability can also be key factors in the determination currently all of our drilling contracts with our customers are on a dayrate basis where we charge the customer a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well we provide the rigs and drilling crews and are responsible for the payment of rig operating and maintenance expenses our customer bears the economic risk and benefit relative to the geologic success of the wells to be drilled the markets for our drilling services have historically been highly cyclical our operating results are significantly affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas companies exploration and development drilling programs drive the demand for drilling services these drilling programs are affected by a number of factors including oil and natural gas companies expectations regarding crude oil and natural gas prices some drilling programs are influenced by short term expectations such as shallow water drilling programs in various regions while others especially deepwater drilling programs are typically subject to a longer term view of crude oil prices other drivers include anticipated production levels worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas products and many other factors access to quality drilling prospects exploration success availability of qualified rigs and operating personnel relative production costs availability and lead time requirements for drilling and production equipment the stage of reservoir development permitting and political and regulatory environments also affect our customers drilling programs crude oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by our customers for oil and natural gas drilling services variations in market conditions during the cycle impact us in different ways depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different regions for example contracts for jackup rigs in certain shallow water markets are shorter term so a deterioration or improvement in market conditions tends to quickly impact revenues and cash flows from those operations contracts in deepwater and other international offshore markets tend to be longer term so a change in market conditions tends to have a delayed impact accordingly short term changes in market conditions may have minimal impact on revenues and cash flows from those operations unless the timing of contract renewals takes place during the short term changes in the market table of contents our revenues depend principally upon the number of our available rigs the number of days these rigs are utilized and the contract dayrates received the number of days our rigs are utilized and the contract dayrates received are largely dependent upon the balance of supply of drilling rigs and demand for drilling services for the different rig classes we operate as well as our rigs operational performance including mechanical efficiency the number of rigs we have available may increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs the construction of new rigs the number of rigs being upgraded or repaired or undergoing standard periodic surveys or routine maintenance at any time and the number of rigs idled during periods of oversupply in the market or when we are unable to contract our rigs at economical rates in order to improve utilization or realize higher contract dayrates we may mobilize our rigs from one geographic region to another for which we may receive a mobilization fee from the client the mobilization fee is intended to cover the cost of moving the rig and during periods when rigs are in short supply may provide revenues in excess of the cost to mobilize the unit mobilization fees received prior to commencement of the drilling contract are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the drilling contract we organize our reportable segments based on the water depth operating capabilities of our drilling rigs our reportable segments include deepwater which consists of our drillships and semisubmersible rigs capable of drilling in water depths of feet and greater midwater which consists of our semisubmersible rigs capable of drilling in water depths of feet or less and independent leg jackup which consists of our jackup rigs capable of operating in water depths up to feet we also manage the drilling operations for two deepwater drilling and production units owned by two clients which are included in a non reported operating segment along with corporate costs and other operations our earnings from operations are primarily affected by revenues utilization of our fleet and the cost of labor repairs insurance and maintenance many of our drilling contracts covering multiple years allow us to adjust the dayrates charged to our customer based on changes in operating costs such as labor costs maintenance and repair costs and insurance costs some of our costs are fixed in nature or do not vary at the same time or to the same degree as changes in revenue for instance if a rig is expected to be idle between contracts and earn no revenue we may maintain our rig crew which reduces our earnings as we cannot fully offset the impact of the lost revenues with reductions in operating costs in addition some drilling contracts provide for the payment of bonus revenues representing a percentage of the rigs contract dayrate and based on the rig meeting defined operations performance criteria during a period our industry has traditionally been affected by shortages of and competition for skilled rig crew personnel during periods of high levels of activity even as overall industry activity declines we expect these personnel shortages to continue especially in the deepwater segment due to the number of newbuild deepwater rigs expected to be delivered through and the need for highly skilled personnel to operate these rigs to better retain and attract skilled rig personnel we offer competitive compensation programs and have increased our focus on training and management development programs following an increase in labor costs continued to increase in especially for skilled personnel in certain geographic locations such as brazil angola and the united states the increase in labor costs during was most pronounced in the deepwater segment and this increase in cost is expected to persist in beginning in the demand for contract drilling services increased significantly resulting in increased demand for oilfield equipment and spare parts this increased demand when coupled with the consolidation of equipment suppliers resulted in longer order lead times to obtain critical spare parts and other equipment components essential to our business along with higher repair and maintenance costs and longer out of service time for major repair and upgrade projects we maintain higher levels of critical spare parts in an effort to minimize unplanned downtime with the decline in prices for steel and other key inputs that started in and the slow return in the level of business activity during we experienced some softening of lead times and pricing for spare parts and equipment during table of contents crude oil prices have maintained a trading range in excess of per barrel since august and averaged approximately per barrel in crude oil prices fell to per barrel in february following the onset of the global financial crisis deteriorating global economic fundamentals and the resulting drop in crude oil demand in a number of the worlds largest oil consuming nations these factors had a negative impact on customer demand for offshore rigs throughout as evidenced by an estimated decline in global exploration and production spending according to the barclays capital ep spending survey while the initial months of were characterized by a cautious pattern from many operators toward new exploration and production spending commitments similar to what was experienced in evidence was present that supported increased spending with a number of new drilling programs commencing in and beyond largely supported by operators increasing confidence in the re establishment of global economic growth and the sustainability of crude oil prices however following the april macondo well incident and subsequent government actions a new level of uncertainty among operators developed with many choosing to delay the commencement of certain projects in the us gulf of mexico and other regions pending further clarity on a number of industry issues worldwide offshore fleet utilization remained flat at approximately at december compared to at december utilization for the industrys deepwater fleet has historically been less sensitive to the extreme fluctuations experienced within the shallow water market even during market downturns the timing of potentially higher spending patterns especially in deepwater is expected to remain uncertain until operators have gained more clarity concerning the long term implications to our industry of the macondo well incident including an understanding of the impact of new operating regulations and government oversight we believe that sustained oil prices above per barrel since mid have contributed to increased confidence among operators and should lead to increased exploration and production spending especially in international locations however operators will need to be confident in stronger oil market fundamentals supported by broadening global economic improvement leading to increased crude oil demand especially among member countries of the organization for economic co operation and development we believe that long term market conditions for offshore drilling services are supported by sound fundamental factors but that future demand for our rigs in the worldwide market is uncertain in the short term due to the macondo well incident in the us gulf of mexico we expect the long term global demand for deepwater contract drilling services to be driven by growing worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas as global populations expand and economic growth accelerates along with an increased focus by oil and natural gas companies on deepwater offshore prospects and increased global participation by national oil companies customer requirements for deepwater drilling capacity have grown since as the successful results in exploration drilling especially since the late s have led to numerous prolonged field development programs around the world but especially in the us gulf of mexico brazil and angola this success has contributed to the demand for a number of our deepwater assets by our clients through the next decade especially those rigs that are capable of operating in water depths of feet and greater and that possess advanced features such as dynamic positioning and well construction capabilities that offer increased drilling efficiencies geological successes in exploratory markets such as the numerous discoveries to date in the pre salt formation offshore brazil the lower tertiary trend in the us gulf of mexico and deeper waters offshore angola along with the continued development of a number of deepwater projects in each of these regions are expected to produce long term growing demand from clients for deepwater rigs following a record deepwater discoveries in operators announced a record deepwater discoveries in covering an expanding number of offshore basins such as ghana the pre salt formation offshore brazil and sierra leone further supporting the long term sustainability of deepwater drilling demand announced discoveries in included discoveries along east africa offshore mozambique and tanzania representing the initial deepwater wells drilled offshore in this vast emerging province additional exploration drilling opportunities offshore east africa are expected to develop in the future with client interest expressed offshore kenya and madagascar in addition international oil companies are experiencing greater access to other promising areas offshore such as india malaysia brunei australia sao tom prncipe liberia gabon greenland and the black sea we anticipate that the combination of drilling successes greater access to offshore basins enhanced hydrocarbon recovery methods and continued advances in offshore drilling technology which support increased efficiency in field development efforts like parallel drilling activities will support the long term outlook for deepwater rig demand however the possible increase in the international rig supply caused by new regulations and delays in the us gulf of mexico could lead to an imbalance of supply leading to a more challenging environment in the short term our deepwater fleet currently operates in brazil west africa and the mediterranean sea as described above under recent developments the deep ocean ascension is currently in the us gulf of mexico and has completed its acceptance testing and is currently on the special standby dayrate awaiting instructions from our client to commence mobilization to the mediterranean sea we took delivery of the deep ocean clarion in september and the rig arrived in the us gulf of mexico in january where it is finalizing customer testing and acceptance the rig will be placed on a special standby dayrate on or before march prior to commencing its five year contract with bp ep which is expected to be no later than july in january we took delivery of the deep ocean mendocino the rig is currently in transit to the us gulf of mexico where it is expected to commence a five year contract with petrobras during the second quarter of following customer testing and acceptance including rig days for our two remaining drillships currently under construction based upon their scheduled delivery dates we currently have of our available rig days contracted for our deepwater fleet in with in in and in since an increase in customer demand for deepwater drilling rigs began in a high percentage of the industrys deepwater fleet of units accumulated large contract backlogs and remained under contract through this high customer demand led to a steep rise in deepwater rig dayrates which peaked above per day for some multi year contracts awarded in although declines in dayrates have occurred from peak levels contract awards for deepwater rigs equipped with dynamic positioning technology capable of drilling in greater than feet of water and available in remained above per day with contract awards in early exceeding per day these dayrates have been supported by strong geologic success especially in brazil west africa the us gulf of mexico and some of the new and emerging deepwater regions which have led to a growing number of commercial discoveries table of contents in brazil exploration drilling in the countrys prolific pre salt formation has found numerous crude oil deposits of significant size residing more than miles offshore and in up to feet of water in the santos basin results of recent appraisal wells to define the potential size of these fields have confirmed the magnitude of the hydrocarbon complex the successful drilling results in brazil and aggressive exploration and development calendar have resulted in an announced exploration and production spending plan by petrobras the national oil company of brazil of over billion from to to support development of the pre salt formation and other global interests the spending plan includes the need for or more incremental deepwater rigs to be deployed in the numerous pre salt fields discovered to date petrobras contracted of the rigs in from the international market and in february ordered seven rigs from a brazilian shipyard with initial deliveries expected by petrobras could order additional rigs from brazilian shipyards or contract the needed rigs from the international rig market rigs obtained from the international rig market could represent additional demand in the short term in addition to the successful pre salt geological trend in the santos basin offshore brazil a similar pre salt geologic trend has been identified offshore west africa which could lead to increased deepwater drilling in that region over the coming years in january sonangol the national oil company of angola began awarding offshore oil blocks residing in the countrys pre salt trend representing an initial step toward the exploration of this highly prospective area in addition deepwater drilling economics have been aided in recent years by an expectation of higher average crude oil prices supported by global population growth and economic expansion and an increased number of deepwater discoveries containing large volumes of hydrocarbons these improving factors associated with deepwater activity have produced a growing base of development programs requiring multiple years to complete and resulting in long term contract awards by our customers especially for projects in the three traditional deepwater basins and represents a significant portion of our revenue backlog that currently extends into industry uncertainty due in part to the macondo well incident and the us governments response and its impact on our clients long term planning horizons has resulted in some clients delaying decisions on deepwater drilling requirements these delayed contracting decisions together with limited charter of rig time between clients have contributed to a decline in dayrates for deepwater rigs from levels experienced in as more units compete for a reduced number of contract opportunities the lower utilization and dayrate decline are most pronounced among the conventionally moored deepwater semisubmersibles which generally have the ability to operate in water depths of up to feet and employ less sophisticated features dayrates for rigs of this technical specification where eight units in the global fleet are currently idle have weakened considerably from peak levels experienced during and could experience further weakness into as a growing number of rigs complete contracts dayrates for the industrys technologically advanced deepwater rigs have also declined from the peak levels in including those possessing dynamic positioning technology and more efficient well construction features however due to operator preference for the advanced capabilities of these units it is expected that utilization will remain high over the coming years but dayrates could adjust lower in the near term for several reasons including continued delay by clients of the commencement of offshore programs especially the large development programs that typically take multiple years to complete also the increase in deepwater drilling capacity particularly in and when as many as uncommitted new deepwater rigs are expected to complete construction programs and enter the active global fleet could place dayrates for these rigs under additional pressure many of the uncommitted units are currently owned by new entrants to our business possessing limited industry knowledge global operational infrastructure and client relationships we believe these attributes along with higher customer and regulatory standards are important considerations for our clients and will allow us to compete effectively for contract opportunities during this period of increased industry supply however we estimate that the macondo well incident and resulting regulatory actions related to drilling in the us gulf of mexico could continue to drive the relocation of a number of the deepwater rigs in the region to international locations which would place dayrates and utilization for rigs in these locations under further pressure as of december six deepwater rigs in the us gulf of mexico have relocated or have been identified for relocation to other regions with additional relocations possible table of contents in new orders for deepwater rigs have been placed by eight contractors with expected deliveries during the new orders and our recent order for a fifth drillship placed in december are driven primarily by attractive pricing and payment terms offered by a number of shipyards and the increasingly favorable long term outlook for the deepwater sector in light of the possible relocation of additional floating rigs out of the us gulf of mexico new deepwater rig capacity additions and increased availability of existing deepwater rigs as current contracts conclude over the next months dayrates and utilization for all deepwater rigs could have difficulty maintaining current levels until client demand begins to accelerate and there is an increase in multi year field development projects an encouraging indicator in the second half of and into the early months of was the existence of several contract awards along with client tenders and inquiries for deepwater rigs with some project commencement dates in these projects are located in various areas including the us gulf of mexico angola and brazil where there is a building expectation that petrobras will seek deepwater rig availability in the near term to address its growing pre salt development needs as well as emerging regions along africa europe and the far east should this trend continue we believe that the industrys most sophisticated units could experience improvement during from the dayrate ranges experienced over most of our midwater segment consists of six semisubmersible rigs five of the rigs currently operate offshore brazil with one rig the pride south seas cold stacked in south africa recently however client interest in this rig has developed and as a result we are currently in the process of reactivating and marketing it to fill client needs in we currently have of our available rig days contracted for our midwater fleet in with in in and none in utilization of the industrys midwater fleet was at december with rigs idle around the world compared to utilization of at the same time in when rigs were idle economic instability and uncertainty in crude oil markets contributed to a growing number of inactive midwater rigs and this reduced level of activity was present through contributing to a more challenging dayrate environment a modest increase in midwater activity during was most evident in australia and in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea as these areas responded positively to improved prices for north sea brent crude oil which averaged per barrel in compared to per barrel in a persistent weakness in the deepwater rig segment for conventionally moored deepwater rigs could result in additional pressure to midwater segment utilization and dayrates in as these more capable rigs are forced to bid reduced dayrates on work programs in shallower water depths in an attempt to remain active thereby eliminating a contract opportunity that may have otherwise been available to a midwater unit also the number of midwater rigs located in the us gulf of mexico has declined significantly over the past years due primarily to the risk of mooring system failures during hurricane season marginal geologic prospects and more attractive opportunities in other regions such as brazil we expect the worldwide supply of available midwater rigs to exceed client demand for the first half of with most contract opportunities characterized by short durations of six months or less our independent leg jackup segment consisting of seven rigs currently operates in the middle east we currently have of our available rig days contracted for our independent leg jackup fleet in with contracted in and and in four of our seven standard independent leg jackup rigs are currently without a contract with limited prospects for work into the first half of customer demand for jackup rigs declined steadily in while contract backlogs fell throughout the industrys existing fleet of rigs and incremental capacity increased as of december independent leg jackup rigs were idle in the global fleet out of a total fleet of representing segment utilization of the addition of new jackup rig capacity in the industry represents a long term threat to the segment due in part to the geologic maturity of many shallow water drilling basins around the world in contrast to the early stages of exploration and development characterized by most of the worlds deepwater basins since jackup rigs have been added to the global fleet with another rigs expected to be added by the end of at december of the expected incremental jackup rigs were without contracts despite the overall decline in jackup fleet utilization since customer demand for high specification units improved in with utilization of these rigs exceeding and dayrates registering modest gains these units possess advanced features including greater hook loads extended cantilever reach and the ability to drill wells with high pressure and temperature characteristics such as those common in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea conversely demand for the industrys standard international class jackup rigs which possess dated features and technology has declined significantly since and is expected to be flat through we experienced approximately out of service days for shipyard maintenance and upgrade projects for for our existing fleet as compared to approximately days for the increase in out of service days in is primarily due to an increase of planned shipyard construction projects in our independent leg jackup and midwater segments partially offset by a reduction of planned projects in our deepwater segment table of contents backlog our contracted backlog at december totaled approximately billion for our executed contracts we expect approximately billion of our total backlog to be realized in our backlog at december was approximately billion we calculate our backlog or future contracted revenue for our offshore fleet as the contract dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining on the contract assuming full utilization backlog excludes revenues for mobilization demobilization contract preparation customer reimbursables and performance bonuses the amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amount disclosed or expected due to various factors downtime due to various operating factors including unscheduled repairs maintenance weather and other factors may result in lower applicable dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate as well as the ability of our customers to terminate contracts under certain circumstances the following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of december the percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under firm contracts as well as scheduled shipyard survey and mobilization days to total available days in the period total available days have been calculated based on the expected delivery dates for our deepwater rigs under construction for the years ending december rig days committed deepwater midwater independent leg jackups critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and accordingly these estimates may change as additional information is obtained as more experience is acquired as our operating environment changes and as new events occur our critical accounting estimates are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain we would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements which could be material if we used different assumptions or estimates we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for property and equipment income taxes and contingent liabilities we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in addition there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation property and equipment property and equipment comprise a significant amount of our total assets we determine the carrying value of these assets based on property and equipment policies that incorporate our estimates assumptions and judgments relative to the carrying value remaining useful lives and salvage value of our rigs we depreciate our property and equipment over the estimated useful lives using the straight line method the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives of our rigs reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations utilization and performance the use of different estimates assumptions and judgments in the establishment of estimated useful lives especially those involving our rigs would likely result in materially different net book values of our property and equipment and results of operations table of contents useful lives of rigs and related equipment are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and natural gas exploration and development changes in market or economic conditions and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the rigs and include changes in operating condition functional capability and market and economic factors we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long term impact of those upgrades on the future marketability when assessing the useful lives of individual rigs during and we extended the useful lives of certain of our rigs based on the results of our review of the useful lives of the rigs upon completion of shipyard projects in this change resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense in of million for continuing operations and increased after tax diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by in this change to the useful lives reduced depreciation expense by million and million for continuing and discontinued operations respectively and increased after tax diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by during based on the results of our review of the useful lives of rigs that completed shipyard projects we had no adjustments to the useful lives of the rigs we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable indicators of possible impairment include i extended periods of idle time and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets ii a significant adverse change in business climate such as a decline in our market value or fleet utilization or iii an adverse change in the manner or physical condition of a group of assets or a specific asset however the drilling industry is highly cyclical and it is not unusual to find that assets that were idle under utilized or contracted at sub economic rates for significant periods of time resume activity at economic rates when market conditions improve additionally our rigs are mobile and we may mobilize rigs from one market to another to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates we monitor our recorded asset values every quarter to determine if there has been a triggering event that may result in impairment to any of our assets as of december we determined that we had no triggering event and no impairment to any of our rigs we use estimated future undiscounted cash flow analyses to determine whether the carrying values of our assets are recoverable in general the analyses are based on expected costs utilization and dayrates for the estimated remaining useful lives of the asset or group of assets being assessed an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of the assessed asset or group of assets is not recoverable asset impairment evaluations are by nature highly subjective they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect managements assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels dayrates and costs the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets and could materially affect our results of operations income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned the income tax rates and methods of computing taxable income vary substantially in each jurisdiction our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of income deductions and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements treaties foreign currency exchange restrictions or our levels of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined table of contents current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year withholding taxes changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed or from tax audit adjustments our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reflected on the balance sheet valuation allowances are determined to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to determine the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as of the valuation allowances we must make estimates and certain assumptions regarding future taxable income including where the rigs are expected to be deployed as well as other assumptions related to our future tax position a change in such estimates and assumptions along with any changes in tax laws could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets liabilities or valuation allowances as discussed below as of december we have net operating loss nol carryforwards with respect to essentially all of our foreign nol carryforwards we have recognized a valuation allowance certain nol carryforwards do not expire while others could expire starting in through we have not provided for us deferred taxes and related foreign dividend withholding taxes on approximately million of unremitted earnings of our foreign controlled subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested if a distribution is made to us from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries we could be required to record additional taxes it is not practicable to determine the amount of additional taxes that may be assessed upon distribution of unremitted earnings as required by law we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various tax authorities within the jurisdictions in which we operate we are currently contesting several tax assessments and may contest future assessments where we believe the assessments are in error we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of existing or future tax assessments however we believe the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax assessments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements we do not believe that it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability if any is dependent on numerous underlying factors that cannot be reasonably estimated these include among other things the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process the impartiality of the local courts and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce or fail to produce an offsetting tax change in other countries our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have been appropriate however past experience is only a guide and the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements contingencies we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to litigation personal injury claims indemnities and potential income and other tax assessments see also income taxes above revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter and include our costs to defend in situations where we expect insurance proceeds to offset contingent liabilities we record a receivable for all probable recoveries up until the net loss is zero we recognize contingent gains when the contingency is resolved and the gain has been realized should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated contingencies revisions to the estimated contingency amounts would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known

performance bonuses and charges to the customer for ancillary services utilization is calculated as the total days worked divided by the total days in the period table of contents deepwater compared with revenues for our deepwater segment increased million or for over the increase in revenues is primarily due to the deep ocean ascension which was placed on a special standby dayrate of beginning in august the pride north america which operated at a higher dayrate in the pride brazil which had higher utilization in due to time in the shipyard for contractual upgrades in the second quarter of the pride portland which operated at a significantly higher dayrate for the majority of as compared to and the pride africa which had higher utilization these factors contributed to an increase in revenues of million over however results for were negatively affected by an on going dispute with a client relating to the responsibility for payment of the time required for equipment inspection and maintenance at the specific request of the client on an unscheduled basis as a result we did not recognize an estimated million of revenues relating to approximately contracted rig days on the pride north america due to the dispute pending resolution of the matter the increase in revenues in was also partially offset by the pride south pacific which after completion of its upgrade commenced a new contract mid january at a substantially lower dayrate and the pride angola which experienced a decrease in days worked of days in over together these factors resulted in a million decrease in revenues in over average daily revenues decreased for over primarily due to the decreased dayrate for the pride south pacific and the impact of the disputed revenue for the pride north america partially offset by the commencement of the special standby dayrate of the deep ocean ascension earnings from operations decreased million or for over due to the decline in earnings from the pride south pacific start up costs related to the deep ocean ascension the deep ocean clarion and the deep ocean mendocino and an increase in labor costs for the offshore workforce utilization increased to for as compared to

carlos walter which underwent a water depth upgrade and regulatory inspection in the first half of and the pride angola compared with revenues for our deepwater segment decreased million or for over the decrease in revenues is primarily due to decreased utilization of the pride north america which experienced approximately out of service days as a result of a scheduled five year regulatory inspection and client requested upgrades in also the pride south pacific which was mobilized to cape town for a regulatory inspection experienced out of service days during in addition the pride rio de janeiro worked at a higher dayrate in than in this decrease in revenues was partially offset by increased dayrates for the pride angola pride brazil and pride carlos walter which collectively contributed approximately million in incremental revenues in than in as a result of the higher dayrates described above average daily revenues increased for over earnings from operations for the segment decreased million or for over primarily due to the decline in revenues and an increase in repair and maintenance costs primarily for the pride north america pride africa and pride portland the

explorer which operated at a substantially higher dayrate in over and contributed an incremental million in over earnings from operations decreased million or for over primarily due to decreased revenues which was largely attributable to the pride south seas and increased labor costs partially offset by incremental earnings associated with the higher dayrate and utilization of the sea explorer utilization decreased to for from for primarily due to the decreased utilization of the pride south seas the pride south america and the pride south atlantic partially offset by the increased utilization of the sea explorer table of contents compared with revenues for our midwater segment decreased million or for over the decrease in revenues is primarily due to lower utilization of the pride venezuela which experienced approximately out of service days in following the agreement with the customer to terminate its current contract and the subsequent mobilization of the rig to the shipyard for repairs this decrease is also due to the pride south seas which completed its contract in august and was idle the remainder of the year this decrease in revenues was largely offset by higher utilization in of the pride mexico which started operations in july after the completion of its shipyard project in addition there was lower mechanical downtime on the pride south atlantic and higher revenues for the sea explorer which commenced a new contract in november at a substantially higher dayrate earnings from operations decreased million or for over due to increased costs related

million shares of common stock in connection with the retirement of the notes although we do not expect that our level of total indebtedness will have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in future periods it may limit our flexibility in certain areas please read risk factors our significant debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities in item a of this annual report other sources and uses of cash we expect our purchases of property and equipment for excluding our commitments related to our drillship construction projects to be approximately million these purchases have been and are expected to be used primarily for various rig upgrades in connection with new contracts as contracts expire during the year the re activation of rigs which were previously taken out of service along with other sustaining capital projects with respect to our drillship construction projects which are scheduled to be completed in and the total remaining costs are estimated to be approximately billion which includes final

under our revolving credit facility we anticipate making income tax payments of approximately million to million in mobilization fees received from customers and the costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one geographic area to another as well as up front fees to modify a rig to meet a customers specifications are deferred and amortized over the term of the related drilling contracts these up front fees and costs impact liquidity in the period in which the fees are received or the costs incurred whereas they will impact our statement of operations in the periods during which the deferred revenues and costs are amortized the amount of up front fees received and the related costs vary from period to period depending upon the nature of new contracts entered into and market conditions then prevailing generally contracts for drilling services in remote locations or contracts that require specialized equipment will provide for higher up front fees than contracts for readily available equipment in major markets table of contents we may redeploy additional assets to more active regions if we have the opportunity to do so on attractive terms we frequently bid for or negotiate with customers regarding multi year contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs we expect to fund project opportunities primarily through a combination of working capital cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter of we initiated a plan to open a regional headquarter for the eastern hemisphere in the netherlands and a project to consolidate our offices in france in order to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies the restructuring effort contemplates closing down one office and reducing the overall workforce in france we expect the restructuring to be completed in the third quarter of and the associated costs to be paid using cash from operations the costs to be incurred for the restructuring will be primarily related to payments to be made under ongoing and one time termination benefit arrangements however the terms are subject to negotiations with and the formal opinion of a local labor committee in addition to the matters described in this liquidity and capital resources section please read fcpa investigation our business and segment review for additional matters that may have a material impact on our liquidity letters of credit we are contingently liable as of december in the aggregate amount of million under certain performance bid and custom bonds and letters of

exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt typically the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable or based on the present value of expected cash flows
