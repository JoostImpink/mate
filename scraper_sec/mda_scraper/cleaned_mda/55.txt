item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors including but not limited to those set forth in part items a risk factors of this report overview synovis life technologies inc a diversified medical device company develops manufactures and markets biological and mechanical products used by several surgical specialties to facilitate the repair and reconstruction of soft tissue damaged or destroyed by disease or injury our products include implantable biomaterials for soft tissue repair devices for microsurgery and surgical tools all designed to reduce risks and or facilitate critical surgeries improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs significant recent development on december synovis baxter international inc a delaware corporation baxter and twins merger sub inc a minnesota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of baxter merger sub entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement pursuant to which baxter will acquire all of the outstanding shares of synovis for per share in cash without interest and pursuant to which merger sub will be merged with and into the company with the company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of baxter the merger the merger is expected to be completed in the first calendar quarter of subject to the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of shares of synovis common stock as well as satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions to closing specified in the merger agreement operating results fiscal in thousands except per share data net revenue increased during fiscal to from in fiscal our operating income was in fiscal compared to in the prior year net income for fiscal was or cents per diluted share compared to or cents per diluted share during fiscal the following table summarizes our net revenue by product group and geography for fiscal and fiscal net revenue in thousands peri strips tissue guard veritas microsurgery surgical tools and other orthopedic and wound total net revenue domestic international worldwide the increase in net revenue in fiscal compared to that of fiscal was primarily due to the following incremental worldwide units sold inclusive of new product introductions increased revenue approximately and higher average net selling prices primarily due to various worldwide hospital list price increases for certain of our products increased revenue by approximately in the united states each of our business units has its own distinct sales channel as of october we have direct sales representatives selling our surgical business products having just completed an expansion of four territories in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we presently expect to add four additional direct sales representatives in fiscal we have direct sales representatives selling our microsurgery products and presently expect to add several direct sales representatives in fiscal for our ortho wound products we have an independent sales force consisting of independent representative groups each with multiple sales representatives as of october and we intend to appoint additional independent sales groups during fiscal internationally all of our products are sold through independent third party stocking distributors the increase in worldwide units sold in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher peri strips revenue believed to be primarily due to increased procedure volumes of sleeve gastrectomies increased volumes of tissue guard units sold worldwide increased market penetration of our microsurgery products and increased ortho wound volumes due primarily to the establishment and development of our independent sales force we cannot fully assess the impact economic conditions may have had on our results of operations during fiscal we believe however that the volume of certain surgical procedures in which our products are used particularly those which may be considered elective has been impacted by economic conditions in addition we believe that the financial condition of various hospital customers has been impacted by the economic conditions these notable items as well as other factors may have had an impact on our results of operations worldwide net revenue from peri strips was in fiscal an increase of or as compared to revenue of in fiscal increased volume of units sold during fiscal drove the revenue increase which we believe was primarily driven by an increased number of sleeve gastrectomy procedures which are more likely to use a buttress compared to other bariatric surgeries and typically use more buttresses per procedure higher average net selling prices in fiscal as compared to fiscal also contributed to the increase peri strips are used to reduce risks and improve patient outcomes in bariatric and thoracic procedures using surgical staples revenue from peri strips used with ethicon surgical staplers increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal while revenue from peri strips used with covidien staplers decreased covidien launched a competitive buttress product in mid fiscal supplied integral with their stapler cartridges which has adversely impacted peri strips revenue in fiscal approximately of our worldwide peri strips revenue was derived from buttresses used with ethicon staplers as compared to in fiscal revenue from tissue guard patch products was in fiscal an increase of or from in fiscal the fiscal increase was driven by a increase in units sold worldwide in addition to higher average selling prices in the current year our tissue guard family of products is used to repair and replace damaged tissue in an array of surgical procedures including cardiac vascular thoracic and neurologic procedures revenue from veritas patch products was in fiscal an increase of or from in fiscal the increase in veritas revenue was driven by higher average net selling prices in fiscal as compared to fiscal veritas is an extremely strong and conformable biomaterial which acts as a scaffold that enables rapid repopulation and revascularization by the surrounding host tissue revenue from microsurgery was in fiscal an increase of or from in fiscal the revenue growth in fiscal was primarily driven by increased market acceptance of the coupler and the flow coupler and higher average net selling prices for our coupler products which cumulatively resulted in a growth in coupler products during fiscal the coupler is a device used to connect extremely small arteries or veins without sutures quickly easily and with consistently excellent results the flow coupler enhances our microsurgery product offerings by combining our existing coupler with doppler technology enabling physicians to verify and monitor blood flow revenue from ortho wound products was in fiscal an increase of or as compared to in fiscal during fiscal we transitioned from a hybrid sales force to a fully independent sales force as they have gained experience with our ortho wound products our independent representatives have become increasingly effective at communicating the clinical benefits of our products to physicians the orthadapt bioimplant is used in numerous orthopedic applications including rotator cuff and achilles tendon repair where there is a clinical need to reinforce the repair unite biomatrix provides a durable collagen structure that need be applied only once to a wound and maintains its integrity while promoting wound healing our gross margin increased by six tenths of a percentage point to in fiscal from during fiscal on a consolidated basis higher average net selling prices in fiscal positively impacted gross margin partially offset by product mix our ortho wound gross margin increased percentage points to in fiscal primarily due to a higher percentage of sales in the current year representing lower cost manufactured inventory as compared to higher cost acquired units in the prior year our surgical business gross margin increased one percentage point to in fiscal primarily due to higher average net selling prices for our products our microsurgical business gross margin increased one percentage point to in fiscal due to higher average net selling prices for certain of our products factors which may affect the gross margin include product and geographic mix of products sold volume product acquisitions and disposals and other production activities accordingly our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on variations in these factors selling general and administrative sga expense during fiscal was an increase of or from sga expense of in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue sga expense was in fiscal as compared to in the prior year the fiscal sga increase was primarily due to approximately in higher sales and marketing costs across each of our businesses driven by increased personnel increased compensation associated with higher revenue levels and increased marketing activities to drive current and long term revenue growth in fiscal we expect to incur higher sga expense as compared to fiscal due to incremental investments we believe are necessary to drive near and long term revenue growth such investments include increased sales staff at both our surgical and microsurgical businesses increased sales and marketing costs to promote our products and increased clinical study activities research and development rd expense totaled during fiscal an increase of or from in fiscal driven by increased project activity and related increased personnel costs in support of higher project activities near and long term fiscal rd activity focused on several activities including research to expand the size offerings and indications for use of our veritas product into new and existing markets providing research and clinical data to support the use of veritas in various surgical procedures exploring additional process improvements and product enhancements for our proprietary biomaterial products advancing the size offerings and technology of the flow coupler and providing research and clinical data to support the launch of the procuff product an arthroscopically delivered augmentation device for tendon repair including rotator cuff repair in fiscal we expect rd expense to increase compared to fiscal due to several activities including research to expand the size offerings and indications for use of our veritas product into new and existing markets providing research and clinical data to support the use of veritas in various surgical procedures exploring additional process improvements and product enhancements for our proprietary biomaterial products advancing the size offerings and technology of the flow coupler and providing research and clinical data to support the launch of the procuff product an arthroscopically delivered augmentation device for tendon repair including rotator cuff repair we recorded operating income of in fiscal an increase of as compared to operating income of in fiscal the increase in operating income in fiscal as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher revenue levels in the current year interest income was in fiscal compared with in fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes in fiscal of at an effective tax rate of this was less than our fiscal effective tax rate of primarily due to recording of discrete income tax benefit in fiscal related to reinstatement of the federal rd credit from fiscal as well as from exercises of employee incentive stock options in fiscal we recorded income tax expense of at an effective rate of as of october we recorded in net current deferred income tax assets and in net long term deferred income tax assets operating results fiscal in thousands except per share data net revenue increased during fiscal to from in fiscal our operating income was in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year net income from continuing operations for fiscal was or cents per diluted share compared to or cents per diluted share during fiscal the following table summarizes our net revenue by product group and geography for fiscal and fiscal net revenue in thousands peri strips tissue guard veritas microsurgery surgical tools and other orthopedic and wound total net revenue domestic international worldwide the increase in net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the following incremental worldwide units sold increased revenue approximately ortho wound products increased revenue approximately and higher average net selling prices primarily due to various worldwide hospital list price increases for certain of our products increased revenue by approximately the increase in worldwide units sold was primarily attributable to the expansion of our direct sales force in the second half of fiscal increased market acceptance of veritas into the worldwide hernia and general surgery markets and increased market penetration of our microsurgery products we believe the expansion of our domestic direct sales force is a key element of our long term strategy to increase revenues in fiscal we expanded our sales force by sales representatives for a total of sales representatives at the end of fiscal as of october we had a total of sales representatives in the us sales representatives sell our veritas peri strips tissue guard and surgical tools and other products nine sales representatives sell our microsurgery products and eight sales representatives sell our ortho wound products we cannot fully assess the impact the economic downturn may have had on our results of operations during fiscal we believe however that the volume of certain surgical procedures in which our products are used particularly those which may be considered elective has been impacted by the current economic downturn in addition we believe that the financial condition of various hospital customers has been negatively impacted by the economic downturn these notable items as well as other factors may have had an impact on our results of operations worldwide net revenue from peri strips was in fiscal essentially flat as compared to revenue of in fiscal increased average net selling prices were offset by slightly lower units sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal peri strips revenue was also affected by the impact of increased competition within the buttressing market covidien one of the two primary companies which offer surgical staplers on which our peri strips products are used launched a buttress product in mid fiscal supplied integral with their stapler cartridges during fiscal worldwide revenue from peri strips products which are used with covidien staplers decreased from fiscal this was offset by fiscal revenue for peri strips products used with ethicon staplers increasing from fiscal revenue from tissue guard patch products was in fiscal an increase of or from in fiscal the fiscal increase was driven by a increase in units sold worldwide in addition to slightly higher average selling prices in the current year revenue from veritas patch products was in fiscal an increase of or from in fiscal veritas revenue growth in fiscal was primarily driven by incremental worldwide sales into the plastic and reconstructive and general surgery markets additionally late in the fourth quarter of fiscal we received ce mark approval for the use of veritas in soft tissue repair and commenced selling veritas to our european distributors higher average net selling prices also contributed to the revenue increase in fiscal revenue from microsurgery was in fiscal an increase of or from in fiscal the revenue growth was primarily driven by the fiscal expansion of our sales force increased market acceptance of the coupler as well as the domestic market launch of the flow coupler in the third quarter of fiscal resulting in a increase in coupler unit sales in fiscal revenue from ortho wound products was in fiscal as compared to from july to october our us sales coverage has increased from approximately at the beginning of fiscal to approximately at the end of fiscal and our ortho wound sales force continues to develop their sales territories and customer base by establishing relationships with pre acquisition customers as well as prospecting for new customers our gross margin increased by one half of a percentage point to in fiscal from during fiscal on a consolidated basis higher average list selling prices for certain of our products in fiscal were partially offset by product mix and lower manufacturing utilization in the current year our surgical business gross margin increased two percentage points to in fiscal primarily due to higher average net selling prices for our products and higher sales of veritas which has a higher gross margin relative to other surgical business products these were offset by lower manufacturing efficiencies in fiscal as compared to fiscal our microsurgical business gross margin decreased one percentage point to in fiscal due to product mix and higher inventory costs our ortho wound gross margin was in fiscal as substantially all of our sales were of inventory acquired in our july acquisition which had higher stepped up cost basis due to purchase accounting rules sga expense during fiscal was an increase of or from sga expense of in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue sga expense was in fiscal as compared to in the prior year the sga expense increase was due to of incremental costs related to our ortho wound business which we acquired in july as well as approximately of incremental expense related to the expansion of our direct sales force in the second half of fiscal additionally stock based compensation expense was cents per diluted share in fiscal up from cents per diluted share in fiscal rd expense totaled during fiscal an increase of or from in fiscal fiscal activity focused on several activities including research to potentially expand the indications of our veritas product into new markets providing research and clinical data to support the use of veritas in various surgical procedures exploring process improvements and product enhancements for our proprietary tissue products comparative studies involving peri strips and its competition advancing the technology of the coupler and further development of an orthopedic product and related instrumentation in fiscal we recorded other operating expenses of we expensed acquired in process rd costs of related to our acquisition of the assets of pegasus as it was determined the related projects had no alternative future use we also recorded an impairment charge of related to identifiable intangible assets related to our fiscal acquisition of the closure surgical fascia closure system closure following an impairment analysis this analysis was performed as a result of a delay in the fiscal re launch and re brand of the product combined with actual revenues since acquisition not meeting projected expectations no other operating expenses were recorded in fiscal we recorded operating income of in fiscal an increase of as compared to operating income of in fiscal the increase in operating income in fiscal as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by a reduction of other operating costs of zero of these costs were incurred in fiscal while were incurred in fiscal in addition the operating loss related to our ortho wound business was approximately higher in fiscal compared to fiscal given a full year of operations in fiscal with this higher operating loss largely offset by higher operating profitability in our other operations interest income was in fiscal compared with in fiscal primarily due to significantly lower investment yields and lower investment balances in the current year additionally in fiscal we sold our auction rate securities ars which had a par value of for realizing a loss on sale of we recorded a provision for income taxes in fiscal of at an effective tax rate of we recorded income tax expense of in fiscal at an effective rate of of pretax income our fiscal effective tax rate was comprised of a tax rate of on operations and interest income and a tax benefit on the capital loss of incurred upon the sale of our ars our fiscal effective tax rate on operations and interest income was lower than fiscal due to lower pretax income in fiscal as compared to fiscal higher permanent differences that reduce taxes and a lower overall rate for state taxes as of october we recorded in net current deferred income tax assets and in net long term deferred income tax assets liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash cash equivalents and investments totaled as of october an increase of as compared to cash cash equivalents and investments of as of october included in the balance above we have of investments classified as non current as of october working capital at october and was and respectively we have no long term debt we currently expect our cash on hand and cash from operations to be sufficient to cover both our short and long term operating requirements subject however to numerous variables including acquisition opportunities research and development priorities and the growth and profitability of the business the increase in cash cash equivalents and investments in fiscal was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of in fiscal this was partially offset by the use of to repurchase shares of our common stock in fiscal operating activities provided cash of in fiscal as compared to providing cash of during fiscal the fiscal cash provided by operating activities was driven by net income of and in non cash expenses working capital changes used cash of in fiscal driven by of cash used for increased accounts receivable and of cash used for increased inventories to support higher revenue levels which were offset by of cash provided by increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable the fiscal cash provided by operating activities was driven by net income of and in non cash expenses working capital changes used cash of in fiscal driven by of cash used for increased accounts receivable and of cash used for increased inventories to support higher revenue levels investing activities used cash of during fiscal we used cash of towards the net purchase of short and long term investments during the year we also used for purchases of property plant and equipment in fiscal investing activities used cash of during fiscal as we used towards the net purchase of short and long term investments and for the purchase of property plant and equipment financing activities used cash of during fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal of cash was used to repurchase shares of common stock partially offset by of proceeds from equity based compensation plans during fiscal of cash was used to repurchase shares of common stock partially offset by of proceeds from equity based compensation plans the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and operating leases for more information see note to our consolidated financial statements our commitments under these obligations are as follows as of october lt year years years lt years total operating leases inflation we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition foreign currency transactions substantially all of our foreign transactions are negotiated invoiced and paid in us dollars fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries may therefore influence the demand for our products by changing the price of our products as denominated in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold critical accounting policies investments our investments consist of taxable and tax exempt commercial paper corporate notesbonds and municipal bond investments our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goal of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines we account for all of our investments as available for sale and report these investments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity we review our investments for impairment to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity such unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other than temporary accounts receivable credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition historical sales and payment history generally collateral is not required accounts receivable are generally due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by considering a number of factors including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due our previous loss history the customers current ability to pay its obligation to us and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts indefinite lived intangible assets our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of goodwill which is carried at cost indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are required to be reviewed annually for impairment and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often as circumstances require in assessing the recoverability of goodwill estimates of market capitalization and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets recoverability is assessed by comparison of the fair value of the company to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment if the fair value of the company is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the company is less than its carrying value if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized definite lived intangible assets definite lived intangible assets consist of patents trademarks developed technology non competes and licenses which are carried at amortized cost we review our definite lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we assess recoverability by reference to future cash flows from the products underlying these intangible assets if these estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the product has been shipped to the customer if there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the products delivery and performance have occurred the price and terms of sale are fixed and collection of the receivable is expected less than five percent of our revenue is derived from consigned inventory for which we recognize revenue upon customer use and receipt of proper purchase order and or purchase requisition documentationall amounts billed to customers in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue our sales policy does not allow sales returns inventories inventories which are comprised of raw materials work in process and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost first in first out fifo or market overhead costs are applied to work in process and finished goods based on annual estimates of production volumes and overhead spending these estimates are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed the estimated value of excess slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value is established on a quarterly basis through review of inventory on hand and assessment of future product demand anticipated release of new products into the market historical experience and product expiration stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation based on certain assumptions within the black scholes model these assumptions are used to determine an estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant and require subjective judgment because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options we assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock based compensation on a regular basis circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes temporary differences deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain financial instruments in cash and cash equivalents investments and accounts receivable we believe that the interest rate credit and market risk related to these accounts is not significant we manage the risk associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value for non collectability of assets and establishment of appropriate allowances in connection with our internal controls and policies we may enter into derivative instruments or perform hedging activities however our policy is to only enter into contracts that can be designated as normal purchases or sales
