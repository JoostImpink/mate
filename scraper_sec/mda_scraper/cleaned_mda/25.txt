item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview thomas betts corporation is a global leader in the design manufacture and marketing of essential components used to manage the connection distribution transmission and reliability of electrical power in industrial construction and utility applications we are also a leading producer of commercial heating and ventilation units used in commercial and industrial buildings and highly engineered steel structures used for utility transmission we have operations in over countries manufacturing marketing and sales activities are concentrated primarily in north america and europe critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales costs expenses assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss collection of the relevant receivable is probable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable we recognize revenue for service agreements over the applicable service periods sales discounts quantity and price rebates and allowances are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized quantity rebates are in the form of volume incentive discount plans which include specific sales volume targets or year over year sales volume growth targets for specific customers certain distributors can take advantage of price rebates by subsequently reselling our products into targeted construction projects or markets following a distributors sale of an eligible product the distributor submits a claim for a price rebate a number of distributors primarily in our electrical segment have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns which are reasonably estimable are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment we analyze historical returns and allowances current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals we provide allowances for doubtful accounts when credit losses are both probable and estimable inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is determined using the first in first out fifo method to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventories we also periodically perform an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items such evaluations are based on managements judgment and use of estimates such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand aging of the inventory sales history and forecasts for particular product groupings planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the acquisition purchase method of accounting for all business combinations under this method all assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination including goodwill indefinite lived intangibles and other intangibles are recorded at fair value the purchase price allocation requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities goodwill page of table of contents consists principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is not amortized for each amortizable intangible asset we use a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed if that pattern cannot be reliably determined the straight line amortization method is used we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year unless circumstances dictate more frequent interim assessments in evaluating when an interim assessment of goodwill is necessary we consider among other things the trading level of our common stock our market capitalization changes in expected future cash flows and mergers and acquisitions involving companies in our industry in evaluating when an interim assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets is necessary we review for significant events or significant changes in circumstances in conjunction with each test of goodwill we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting units carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of three valuation methods market multiple approach discounted cash flow approach and comparable transactions approach the market multiple approach provides indications of value based on market multiples for public companies involved in similar lines of business the discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of projected future cash flows using appropriate discount rates the comparable transactions approach provides indications of value based on an examination of recent transactions in which companies in similar lines of business were acquired the fair values derived from these three valuation methods are then weighted to arrive at a single value for each reporting unit relative weights assigned to the three methods are based upon the availability relevance and reliability of the underlying data we then reconcile the total values for all reporting units to our market capitalization and evaluate the reasonableness of the implied control premium to the extent a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value an indication exists that the reporting units goodwill may be impaired and we must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as of the assessment date the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date methods used to determine fair values for indefinite lived intangible assets involve customary valuation techniques that are applicable to the particular class of intangible asset and apply inputs and assumptions that we believe a market participant would use long lived assets we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable indications of impairment require significant judgment by management for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets we evaluate assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for associated product groups if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets the assets are considered to be impaired impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets when fair values are not available we page of table of contents estimate fair values using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of benefit plans in our consolidated balance sheets for purposes of calculating pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs we use certain actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense and or liability measurement we evaluate these assumptions annually other assumptions include employee demographic factors retirement patterns mortality and turnover rate of compensation increase and the healthcare cost trend rate see additional information contained in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations qualified pension plans income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and requires an evaluation of the realizability of deferred income tax assets based on a more likely than not criteria we have valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign income tax credit carryforwards realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income we believe that it is more likely than not that future taxable income based on enacted tax laws in effect as of december will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances environmental costs environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of currently available facts related to each site the operation of manufacturing plants involves a high
