determined to be a reportable segment beginning in the segment information has been recast to conform to the current year presentation our electric distribution segment earnings decreased million in as compared to due primarily to lower generation earnings of million at psnh resulting from the sales of its thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in higher depreciation expense higher operations and maintenance expense higher interest expense and higher property and other tax expense the earnings decrease was partially offset by higher non service income from our benefit plans the impact of the clp base distribution rate increase effective may and the recognition of carrying charges on psnh storm costs approved for recovery earnings were also favorably impacted by lower income tax expense net of lower distribution revenues resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act our electric transmission segment earnings increased million in as compared to due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure partially offset by a reduction in the benefits from tax reform as compared to and approximately

fluctuations in energy supply costs conservation measures including utility sponsored energy efficiency programs and economic conditions affect customer energy usage and water consumption industrial sales volumes are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales volumes in our service territories weather impacts both electric and water sales volumes during the summer and both electric and natural gas sales volumes during the winter however natural gas sales volumes are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales volumes customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree days that occurfluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at psnh and natural gas sales volumes at yankee gas prior to november impacted earnings traditional in the table below for clp nstar electric effective february as a result of a dpu approved rate case decision yankee gas effective november as a result of a pura approved rate case settlement and nstar gas fluctuations in retail sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms decoupled in the table below these distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized fluctuations in water sales volumes largely do not impact earnings as our connecticut water distribution business is also decoupleda dpu approved energy efficiency plan at nstar electric

hampshire border to franklin new hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between franklin and deerfield new hampshirenorthern pass has achieved several key milestones including receiving the following major permits national energy board of canada permit issued which authorizes the construction of the transmission line that will connect with northern pass at the qubec new hampshire border on march nhpuc approval on february for the proposed lease of certain land and easement rights from psnh to npt concluding that the lease is in the public interest us forest service record of decision on january which allows npt to install approximately miles of underground transmission lines along existing roads through the white mountain national forest province of qubec permit granted to hq on december to construct the hydroelectric transmission line that will connect at the border of new hampshire doe record of decision and presidential permit on november which will allow construction of transmission facilities at the qubec new hampshire border and doe final environmental impact statement issued on august which concluded that the proposed northern pass route is the preferred alternative providing substantial benefits with only minimal impactsthe following permits remain outstanding the nhsec certificate of site and facility approving construction of the project in new hampshire the us forest service special use permit as authorized by the january record of decision and the army corps of engineers permit allowing the discharge of dredging material or other fill into wetlands and other waters under section of the clean water act and section of the river and harbors act on january northern pass was selected from the proposal packages submitted as the winning bidder in the massachusetts clean energy request for proposal rfp which successfully positioned northern pass to provide a firm delivery of hydropower to massachusetts on february the nhsec voted to deny northern pass siting application on march the massachusetts edcs in coordination with the doer and an independent evaluator notified northern pass that the edcs had terminated its selection and all contract negotiations on march the nhsec released its written decision confirming its denial on april npt filed a motion for rehearing with the nhsec and on july the nhsec issued its written decision denying northern pass motion for rehearing on august npt filed an appeal to the new hampshire supreme court alleging that the nhsec failed to follow applicable law in its review of the project on october the new hampshire supreme court accepted this appeal subsequently the nhsec transmitted the record of its proceedings to the new hampshire supreme court on december briefing of the appeal began on february the new hampshire supreme court has not set a date for oral argument npt intends to continue to pursue nhsec approval to construct this project the march nhsec decision denying northern pass siting application caused us to review the recoverability of our northern pass project costs in the first quarter of in this recoverability review we estimated undiscounted expected project cash flows and compared the result to our estimated project costs to determine whether the recorded amount was recoverable our undiscounted cash flows were substantially in excess of our estimated project costs we completed this analysis and concluded that our project costs were recoverable as of march based on our expectation that the northern pass project remains probable of being placed in service consistent with eversources and hqs long term relationship to bring clean energy into new england eversource and hq remain committed to northern pass and the many benefits this project will bring to our customers and the region if as a result of future events and changes in circumstances a new recoverability review were to conclude that our project costs are not recoverable then we would reduce northern pass project costs to the estimated fair value which could result in most of our million of capitalized project costs being impaired such an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operationsgreater boston reliability solution in february iso ne selected the greater boston and new hampshire solution the solution proposed by eversource and national grid to satisfy the requirements identified in the greater boston study the solution consists of a portfolio of electric transmission upgrades in southern new hampshire and northern massachusetts and continuing into the greater boston metropolitan area of which upgrades are in eversources service territory the nhsec issued its written order approving the new hampshire upgrades on october all the new hampshire upgrades including the merrimack valley reliability project have been completed and placed in service we are currently pursuing the necessary regulatory and siting application approvals in massachusetts to date we have received approval for five of these projects from the massachusetts energy facilities siting board and anticipate approval of two additional projects in the second quarter of construction has also begun on numerous smaller projects several of which have been placed in service most upgrades are expected to be completed by the end of two projects are expected to be in service by the end of and another project by mid we estimate our portion of the investment in the solution will be approximately million of which million

contracts with edcs in massachusetts connecticut new hampshire maine and rhode island subsequently in the massachusetts supreme judicial court and the nhpuc each ruled that state statutes precluded the state regulatory agencies from approving those contracts in massachusetts and new hampshire respectively the new hampshire supreme court overruled the nhpuc decision in may legislative changes are needed in massachusetts to allow the dpu to approve natural gas pipeline capacity contracts no such changes have occurred during any legislative session to datein september a series of non eversource natural gas explosions in eastern massachusetts resulted in widespread property and system damage personal injuries and a fatality as a result of these events compounded by the failure to secure massachusetts legislation to date we believe there is significant uncertainty around the future timing of and ability to secure needed legislative change affecting the natural gas industry and pipeline expansion which may significantly delay the completion of the access northeast projecteversource identified the september natural gas series of explosions compounded by the adverse legislative environment as negative evidence that indicated potential impairment our impairment assessment used a discounted cash flow approach including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project and involved significant management judgment and estimation including projections of the projects discounted cash flows and assumptions about exit price in the third quarter of management determined that the future cash flows of the access northeast project were uncertain and could no longer be reasonably estimated and that the book value of our equity method investment was not recoverable as a result eversource recorded an other than temporary impairment of million pre tax within other income net on our statement of income in which represented the full carrying value of our equity method investmentferc regulatory mattersferc transmission rate settlement on december ferc initiated a proceeding to review the new england transmission owners netos regional and local transmission rates due to a lack of transparency the ferc also found that the formula rates generally lacked sufficient details to determine how costs are derived and recovered in rates this proceeding was set for hearing but held in abeyance to provide time for settlement judge procedures on august a signed settlement agreement between twenty eight parties including all six new england state regulatory commissions the netos including clp nstar electric and psnh and other settling parties was filed at the ferc the settlement agreement includes among other things a new formula rate template effective on january in which all regional and local transmission revenue requirements will be determined through a single formula rate the settlement agreement was contested by a group of municipal entities and the ferc trial staff on november the settlement administrative law judge reported the contested settlement to the ferc the netos are awaiting an order from the ferc ferc roe complaints four separate complaints have been filed at the ferc by combinations of new england state attorneys general state regulatory commissions consumer advocates consumer groups municipal parties and other parties collectively the complainants in each of the first three complaints filed on october december and july respectively the complainants challenged the netos base roe of percent that had been utilized since and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final ferc order and for the separate month complaint periods in the fourth complaint filed april the complainants challenged the netos base roe billed of percent and the maximum roe for transmission incentive incentive cap of percent asserting that these roes were unjust and unreasonable the roe originally billed during the period october beginning of the first complaint period through october consisted of a base roe of percent and incentives up to percent on october the ferc set the base roe at percent and the incentive cap at percent for the first complaint period this was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning october this ferc order was vacated on april by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the court all amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded eversource has recorded a reserve of million pre tax and excluding interest for the second complaint period as of december this reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a percent base roe and percent incentive cap the reserve consisted of million for clp million for nstar electric and million for psnh as of december on october ferc issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the court ferc proposed a new framework to determine whether an existing roe is unjust and unreasonable and if so how to calculate a replacement roe the parties to these proceedings were directed to submit briefs on this new proposed framework and how they would apply the proposed framework in each of the four complaint proceedings initial briefs were filed by the netos complainants and ferc trial staff on january the netos brief was supportive of the overall roe methodology determined in the october order providing the ferc does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results reply briefs will be filed on march the ferc order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using fercs proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint those preliminary calculations indicated that for the first complaint period for the netos that ferc concludes are of average financial risk a preliminary range of presumptively just and reasonable base roes is percent to percent the pre existing base roe of percent is therefore unjust and unreasonable the preliminary just and reasonable base roe is percent and the preliminary incentive cap on total roe is percent if the results of these illustrative calculations were included in a final ferc order for each of the complaint periods then a percent base roe and a percent incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periodsalthough the order provided illustrative calculations ferc stated that these calculations are merely preliminary the fercs preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final ferc order as changes to the methodology by ferc are possible as a result of the parties arguments and calculations in the briefing process until ferc issues a final decision on each of these four complaints there is significant uncertainty and at this time the company cannot reasonably estimate a range of gain or loss for any of the four complaint proceedings the october ferc order or the january briefs did not provide a reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized roes for any of the complaint periods

harbor electric energy company a wholly owned subsidiary of nstar electric heec and the massachusetts water resources authority together with nstar electric and heec the defendants the action alleged that the defendants failed to comply with certain permitting requirements related to the placement of the heec owned electric distribution cable beneath boston harbor the action sought an order to compel heec to comply with cable depth requirements in the united states army corps of engineers permit or alternatively to remove the electric distribution cable and cease unauthorized work in us waterways the action also sought civil penalties and other coststhe parties reached a settlement pursuant to which heec agreed to install a new kv distribution cable across boston harbor to deer

surrounding the current permit from the united states army corps of engineers are expected to be resolved and such litigation is expected to be dismissed with prejudice in as a result of the settlement nstar electric expensed million pre tax of previously incurred capitalized costs associated with engineering work performed on the existing cable that will no longer be used in addition nstar electric agreed to provide a rate base credit of million to the massachusetts water resources authority for the new cable this negotiated credit resulted in the initial million of construction

investors one to sell its thermal generation assets at a purchase price of million subject to adjustment the thermal agreement and a second to sell its hydroelectric generation assets at a purchase price of million subject to adjustment the hydro agreement the nhpuc approved these agreements in late november at which time the company classified these assets as held for sale on january psnh completed the sale of its thermal generation assets pursuant to the thermal agreement in accordance with the thermal agreement the original purchase price of million was adjusted to reflect working capital adjustments closing date adjustments and proration of taxes and fees prior to closing totaling million in the second quarter of the purchase price was further adjusted by million relating to

hydroelectric licenses to private investors on august psnh completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets pursuant to the hydro agreement in accordance with the hydro agreement the original purchase price of million was adjusted to reflect contractual adjustments totaling million resulting in net proceeds of million the difference between the carrying value of the hydroelectric generation assets and the sale proceeds resulted in a gain of million an estimated gain from the sale of these assets was included as an offset to the total remaining costs associated with the sale of generation assets that were securitized on may on may psnh funding issued million of securitized rrbs pursuant to a finance order issued by the nhpuc to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of psnhs generation assets these rrbs are secured by a non bypassable charge recoverable from psnh customers psnh recorded regulatory assets and other deferred costs in connection with the

issuance see liquidity rate reduction bonds in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations us federal corporate income taxes on september the nhpuc issued a decision on the impact of the us federal corporate income tax rate reduction from the tax cuts and jobs act the nhpuc concluded that the tax law change qualified as an exogenous event as defined in the public service company of new hampshire restructuring and rate stabilization agreement and that the benefit of incurring the lower federal income tax expense would be passed back to customers with carrying charges the next psnh distribution rate case shall address the impacts of edit the lower federal income tax rate and the overcollection of the lower income tax rate from january to the rate adjustment effective date of july or earlier if a rate case is filed for rates effective prior to july as of december psnh has recorded a reserve of million to reflect the difference between the percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the percent federal corporate income tax rate effective january the edit balance related to psnhs divested generation assets has been included as a component of the securitization of the stranded generation assets and has started to be refunded to customers via the stranded cost recovery charge effective august through storm costs on september the nhpuc approved the recovery of million plus carrying charges in storm costs incurred from august through march and the transfer of funding from psnhs major storm reserve to offset those costs the costs of these storms excluding the equity return component of the carrying charges were deferred as regulatory assets and the funding reserve collected from customers was accrued as a regulatory liability the storm cost deferral is separate from the major storm funding reserve that is being collected from customers as a result of the duration of time between incurring storm costs in august through march and final approval from the nhpuc in psnh recognized million pre tax for the equity return component of the carrying charges which have been collected from customers within other income net on our statement of income in storm costs incurred from december through april have been audited by the nhpuc staff and are pending nhpuc approval as of december the pre tax equity return component of the carrying charges related to storms incurred after march was million which will be recognized to earnings upon nhpuc approval of those storm costsreliability enhancement program on december the nhpuc approved psnhs extension of the reliability enhancement program for the extension included cost recovery associated with vegetation management costs the vegetation management spending which is consistent with prior years spending will be deferred and offset against amounts due to customers as a result of federal income tax

over assessed the value of the property owned by psnh for the and property tax years as a result of this decision psnh received million in property tax refunds and interest in critical accounting policiesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates assumptions and at times difficult subjective or complex judgments changes in these estimates assumptions and judgments in and of themselves could materially impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows our management discusses with the audit committee of our board of trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are discussed below see the combined notes to our financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements regulatory accounting our regulated companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate regulated operations which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses the regulated companies financial statements reflect the effects of the rate making process the application of accounting guidance for rate regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates in some cases we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission we must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery we base our conclusion on certain factors including but not limited to regulatory precedent regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customerswe use judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities however regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs and those conclusions could have a material impact on our financial statements we believe it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded if we determine that we can no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate regulated enterprises to our operations or that we cannot conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered from customers in future rates the costs would be charged to earnings in the period in which the determination is madepension serp and pbop we sponsor pension serp and pbop plans to provide retirement benefits to our employees for each of these plans several significant assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation funded status and net periodic benefit cost these assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets discount rate compensationprogression rate and mortality and retirement assumptions we evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows expected long term rate of return on plan assets in developing the expected long term rate of return we consider historical and expected returns as well as input from our consultants our expected long term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class we routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate for the year ended december our expected long term rate of return assumption used to determine our pension and pbop expense was percent for the eversource service plans and percent for the aquarion plans for the forecasted pension and pbop expense an expected long term rate of return of percent for the eversource service plans and percent for the aquarion plans will be used reflecting our target asset allocationsdiscount rate payment obligations related to the pension serp and pbop plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plans cash flows the discount rate that was utilized in determining the pension serp and pbop obligations was based on a yield curve approach this approach utilizes a population of bonds with an average rating of aa based on bond ratings by moodys sp and fitch and uses bonds with above median yields within that population as of december the discount rates used to determine the funded status were within a range of percent to percent for the pension and serp plans and within a range of percent to percent for the pbop plans as of december the discount rates used were within a range of percent to percent for the pension and serp plans and within a range of percent to percent for the pbop plans the increase in the discount rates used to calculate the funded status resulted in a decrease to the pension and pbop plans liability of approximately million and million respectively as of december the company uses the spot rate methodology for the service and interest cost components of pension serp and pbop expense for the eversource plans because it provides a more precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve the discount rates used to estimate the expense were within a range of percent to percent for the pension and serp plans and within a range of percent to percent for the pbop plans mortality assumptions assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension serp and pbop plans are a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and the corresponding plan liability we need to record in a revised scale for the mortality table was released and we utilized it in our measurements compensationprogression rate this assumption reflects the expected long term salary growth rate including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements and impacts the estimated benefits that pension and serp plan participants receive in the future as of december and the compensationprogression rate used to determine the funded status was percent for the eversource service plans and percent for the aquarion plans health care cost in august we amended the eversource pbop plan to standardize benefit design and make benefit changes as a result this plan is no longer subject to health care cost trends the aquarion pbop plan is still subject to heath care cost trends for the aquarion pbop plan the health care trend rate is a range of percent to percent with an ultimate rate of percent to percent in and for post and pre retirees respectively actuarial determination of expense pension serp and pbop expense is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations and amortization of actuarial gains and losses offset by the expected return on plan assets actuarial gains and losses represent the amortization of differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions pre tax net periodic benefit expense for the pension and serp plans was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively for the pbop plans there was net periodic pbop income of million million and million for the years ended december and respectively the expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long term rate of return to the pension and pbop plan asset balances this calculated expected return is compared to the actual return or loss on plan assets at the end of each year to determine the investment gains or losses to be immediately reflected in unamortized actuarial gains and losses forecasted expenses and expected contributions we estimate that expense in for the pension and serp plans will be approximately million and income in for the pbop plans will be approximately million pension serp and pbop expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and other assumptions and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans our policy is to fund the pension plans annually in an amount at least equal to the amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements we contributed million to the pension plans in we currently estimate contributing approximately million to the pension plans in for the pbop plans it is our policy to fund the pbop plans annually through tax deductible contributions to external trusts we contributed million to the pbop plans in we currently estimate contributing million to the pbop plans in sensitivity analysis the following represents the hypothetical increase to the pension plans excluding the serp plans reported annual cost and a decrease to the pbop plans reported annual income as a result of a change in the following assumptions by basis points millions of dollarsincrease in pension plan cost decrease in pbop plan incomeassumption changeas of december as of december eversource lower expected long term rate of return lower discount rate higher compensation rate na nagoodwill we recorded goodwill on our balance sheet associated with previous mergers and acquisitions on december we completed the acquisition of aquarion resulting in the addition of billion of goodwill as of december a total of billion of goodwill is recorded on our balance sheet we have identified our reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill as electric distribution electric transmission natural gas distribution and water distribution electric distribution and electric transmission reporting units include carrying values for the respective components of clp nstar electric and psnh the natural gas distribution reporting unit includes the carrying values of nstar gas and yankee gas the water distribution reporting unit was created upon completion of the acquisition of aquarion and includes the water utility businesses as of december goodwill was allocated to the reporting units as follows billion to electric distribution billion to electric transmission billion to natural gas distribution and billion to water distributionwe are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by considering the fair values of the reporting units which requires us to use estimates and judgments we have selected october st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair values of the reporting units assets and liabilities is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill if goodwill were deemed to be impaired it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of october for the electric distribution electric transmission natural gas distribution and water distribution reporting units this evaluation required the consideration of several factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units including conditions and assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units key considerations include discount rates utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples and internal estimates of future cash flows and net income the goodwill impairment test resulted in a conclusion that goodwill is not impaired and no reporting unit is at risk of a goodwill impairment the fair value of the reporting units was substantially in excess of carrying valuelong lived assets impairment evaluations of long lived assets including property plant and equipment and strategic infrastructure and other investments involve a significant degree of estimation and judgment including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist impairment analysis is required when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable indicators of potential impairment include a deteriorating business climate unfavorable regulatory action decline in value that is other than temporary in nature plans to dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life and accumulation of costs that are in excess of amounts allowed for recovery the review of long lived assets for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and external developments including assessment of current and projected market conditions that can impact future cash flowsaccess northeast eversource recorded an other than temporary impairment of million within other income net on our statement of income in related to access northeast an equity method investment in september a series of non eversource natural gas explosions in eastern massachusetts resulted in widespread property and system damage personal injuries and a fatality eversource identified the september natural gas series of explosions compounded by the adverse legislative environment as negative evidence that indicated potential impairment of our investment in access northeast our impairment assessment used a discounted cash flow approach including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project and involved significant management judgment and estimation including projections of the projects discounted cash flows and assumptions about exit price in the third quarter of management determined that the future cash flows of the access northeast project were uncertain and could no longer be reasonably estimated and that the book value of our equity method investment was not recoverable for further information see note k investments to the financial statements npt in march the new hampshire site evaluation committee nhsec issued a written decision denying northern pass siting application after which the massachusetts edcs terminated the selection of and subsequent contract negotiations with northern pass under the massachusetts clean energy rfp the march nhsec decision denying northern pass siting application caused us to review the recoverability of our northern pass project costs in the first quarter of in this recoverability review we estimated undiscounted expected project cash flows and compared the result to our estimated project costs to determine whether the recorded amount was recoverable our undiscounted cash flows were substantially in excess of our estimated project costs we completed this analysis and concluded that our project costs were recoverable as of march based on our expectation that the northern pass project remains probable of being placed in service if as a result of future events and changes in circumstances a new recoverability review were to conclude that our project costs are not recoverable then we would reduce northern pass project costs to the estimated fair value which could result in most of our million of capitalized project costs being impaired such an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operationsas of december we did not identify any other impairment indicators for our long lived assets if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable we would perform an impairment analysis an impairment analysis would consist of two steps first the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset would be compared with the carrying value of the asset and second if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows an impairment charge would be recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair valueincome taxes income tax expense is estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and is recorded each quarter using an estimated annualized effective tax rate this process to record income tax expense involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses as well as any impact of permanent differences non tax deductible expenses or other items that directly impact income tax expense as a result of regulatory activity flow through items the temporary differences and flow through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the balance sheetswe also account for uncertainty in income taxes which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets the determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under applicable accounting guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us on december the tax cuts and jobs act became law which amended existing federal tax rules and included numerous provisions that impacted corporations in particular the act reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from percent to percent effective january for our regulated companies the most significant changes are the benefit of incurring a lower federal income tax expense and the reduction in adit liabilities now excess adit or edit which are estimated to be approximately billion and included in regulatory liabilities as of december the refund of these regulatory liabilities to customers will generally be made over the same period as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the adit liabilitieswe have completed our evaluation of the impacts of the act as of december the ultimate outcome was not materially different from the provisional estimates recorded as of december while we have recorded the impacts of the act based on interpretation of the provisions as enacted it is expected the us department of treasury and the irs will issue additional interpretative guidance in the future that could result in changes to previously finalized provisions at this time some of the states in which we do business have issued guidance regarding the act and the impact was not material amortization of the edit liabilities began in at our psnh and yankee gas subsidiaries the total amortization for was million and million for psnh and yankee gas respectively accounting for environmental reserves environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated increases to estimates of environmental liabilities could have an adverse impact on earnings we estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long term monitoring current site information from our site assessments remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites if a most likely action

mgp sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured gas from coal and other processes which resulted in certain by products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to

costs or new information from other sources including the level of contamination at the site the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates due to certain economic factors fair value measurements we follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price we have applied this guidance to our companys derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as normal purchases or normal sales normal to marketable securities held in trusts to our investments in our pension and pbop plans and to nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and aros this guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock long term debt and rrbschanges in fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as we recover the costs of these contracts in rates charged to customers these valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made we use quoted market prices when available to determine the fair value of financial instruments if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model derived valuations when quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy related product prices for future years for long dated derivative contracts and market volatilities discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts reflecting risk adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price using available
