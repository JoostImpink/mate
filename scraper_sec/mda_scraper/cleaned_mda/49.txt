more specifically the company has focused on providing outsourced publisher services both content processing and printing for the scholarly publishing educational and other markets the company has a leading position in the stm market and delivers customized content processing services using state of the art technologies in addition to traditional print services the company has continued to invest in opportunities in the educational and government services markets and in the proprietary technology products known as emerging solutions the companys specialty packaging segment has achieved growth and improved financial performance in recent years as a result of focusing on growth markets that benefit from the customized package design and production services the company offers particularly in the healthcare consumer products and telecommunications markets as well as the expansion of its global network the companys us packaging facility is both iso registered and has passed customer cgmp compliance audits as evidence of the high level of quality delivered to our customers the specialty packaging segment has also differentiated itself by developing a proprietary network of offshore production affiliates known as global packaging solutions and by linking those operations and its customers via a proprietary inventory management and fulfillment system in june the company initiated a comprehensive equipment replacement and consolidation plan to its publisher services print platform and specialty packaging capabilities the plan is designed to continue to grow the companys position in its target publishing markets to sustain the growth generated in its specialty packaging segment to retire older and less efficient press equipment and to more aggressively rationalize capacity across its manufacturing platform in connection with this equipment replacement and consolidation plan the company is consolidating two facilities and expanding and renovating several other facilities to accommodate new equipment to permit improved work flows and to facilitate the rationalization of similar work currently performed at multiple sites the company spent approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal the majority of which related to this plan it is expected that the equipment upgrades and the expansion of facilities will be substantially complete by the middle of fiscal despite the adverse effect in fiscal of operational inefficiencies from the implementation of the equipment replacement and consolidation plan the company believes that once fully implemented the plan will enhance the companys overall competitiveness and create significant long term value for its shareholders in fiscal the company purchased the remaining interest in knowledgeworks global limited kgl from datamatics technologies limited with whom the company had operated a joint venture in india since fiscal kgl provides a full range of content processing content management and related services to stm scholarly and educational publishers and other organizations on a global basis the company believes kgl provides the ability to continue to grow its services to the stm and educational markets and expand its offshore outsourcing opportunities at the end of fiscal the companys specialty packaging segment formed a joint venture in hong kong with periscope inc the joint venture was selected as one of only four global print managers to serve a large us based retail chain the company believes this opportunity will permit it to apply its global brand management expertise on a much larger scale as it expands the print and packaging network beyond the caribbean rim to mainland china thailand india and turkey application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods table of contents the company considers the following accounting policies to be critical policies which involve various estimation processes allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of intangible assets and goodwill pension and other post retirement benefits income taxes self insurance reserves allowance for doubtful accounts cadmus policy with respect to its trade receivables is to maintain an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of customers to make required payments the companys process to estimate the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable balances consists of two steps first the company evaluates specific accounts for which it has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy in these cases the company uses its judgment based on available facts and circumstances and records a specific allowance for that customer against the receivable to reflect the amount it expects to ultimately collect second the company establishes an additional reserve for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories based on managements best estimate the company periodically evaluates the adequacy of its reserves based on the available facts and circumstances at the time if the financial condition of cadmus customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances could be required valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in completing the transitional impairment test required by sfas no goodwill and other intangible assets the company tested the net goodwill balances attributable to each of its reporting units for indications of impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value fair value was determined using discounted cash flow estimates for each reporting unit in accordance with the provisions of sfas no the preparation of such discounted cash flow estimates requires significant management judgment with respect to operating profit growth rates appropriate discount rates and residual values the company has completed annual impairment tests as of april of each year since the adoption of sfas no the tests were conducted in a manner consistent with the companys initial impairment test as a result of those annual impairment tests there were no indications of impairment and no adjustments to the carrying amount of goodwill were required the total balance of goodwill as of june and relates to the companys publisher services segment pension and other post retirement benefits the company sponsors certain pension and other post retirement plans covering associates who meet eligibility requirements several factors are used to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans these factors include assumptions determined by the company about the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases in addition the companys actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the impact of these trends on expense and liability amounts the economic and actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants while the company believes its assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the companys assumptions may materially affect its pension and other post retirement obligations and its future expense in fiscal upon completion of its annual pension valuations the company recorded a reduction of its minimum pension liability in fiscal in accordance with sfas no employers accounting for pensions totaling million million net of taxes the adjustment to the minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct increase to shareholders equity net of taxes table of contents in fiscal upon completion of its annual pension valuations the company recorded an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no totaling million million net of taxes the adjustment to the minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct charge to shareholders equity net of taxes in fiscal upon completion of its annual pension valuations the company recorded a decrease to its minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no totaling million million net of taxes the adjustment to the minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct increase to shareholders equity net of taxes the companys contributions to its defined benefit pension plans totaled million million and million in fiscal and respectively the company anticipates having to contribute million to its primary defined benefit pension plan in fiscal and to contribute million to its other defined benefit pension plans in fiscal in fiscal the companys board of directors voted to freeze the cadmus pension plan to mitigate the volatility in pension expense and required cash contributions expected in future years for the companys primary defined benefit plan a one percentage point change in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have the following impact on fiscal pension expense and accumulated benefit obligation respectively percentage point increase decrease in thousands effect on pension expense effect on accumulated benefit obligation for the companys primary defined benefit plan a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have the following impact on fiscal pension expense and accumulated benefit obligation respectively percentage point increase decrease in thousands effect on pension expense effect on accumulated benefit obligation changes in the discount rate noted above also impact unrecognized losses another component of pension expense as a result a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate will not have a correspondingly equal impact on overall pension expense income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates in addition to estimating the actual current tax liability the company must assess future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the companys consolidated balance sheets and operating loss carryforwards such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheets management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is not considered likely establishes a valuation allowance against those assets the valuation allowance is based on estimates of future taxable income by jurisdictions in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable judgment is involved in determining the provision for income taxes the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets the company files income tax returns with various state tax jurisdictions in addition to the internal revenue service and is sometimes audited by both federal and state tax agencies from time to time those audits may result in proposed table of contents adjustments the company has considered these potential adjustments and does not anticipate any material impact on its earnings as a result of the various audits to the extent that actual results differ from managements estimates new information results in changes to estimates or there is a material change in the actual tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or adjust the effective tax rate which could materially impact the companys financial position and results of operations in july the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no fin accounting

on our consolidated financial statements self insurance reserves the company is self insured for both medical and workers compensation claims the company engages third party firms to provide claims processing for its medical and workers compensation claims and to calculate ultimate loss projections relative to its workers compensation claims the company records its reserves for medical and workers compensation claims based on the information supplied by the third party firms the companys policy is to adjust its workers compensation reserve based on an analysis of individual claims at each reporting date with considerations of stop loss insurance provisions for both aggregate claim years and individual claims the company maintains a medical reserve for claims incurred but not reported based on its best estimate of its ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred as of the reporting date actual claims expense as well as changes in the healthcare cost trends could result in the companys eventual cost differing from the estimate significant transactions restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company initiated a comprehensive equipment replacement and consolidation plan to its publisher services print platform and specialty packaging capabilities this plan is designed to replace certain older less efficient presses with state of the
