item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview ats medical inc hereinafter the company ats we us or our develops manufactures and markets medical devices for the treatment of structural heart disease used by cardiovascular surgeons in the cardiac surgery operating theater currently we participate in the markets for heart valve therapy including mechanical bileaflet replacement heart valves tissue heart valves and valve repair products and the surgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias primarily the treatment of atrial fibrillation additionally a small portion of our business is comprised of surgical tools and accessories used by the cardiac surgeon for the treatment of structural heart disease in we licensed a patented and partially developed mechanical heart valve from carbomedics inc under the terms of the license we would complete the development of the valve and agreed to purchase carbon components from carbomedics as a result ats now holds an exclusive royalty free worldwide license to an open pivot bileaflet mechanical heart valve design owned by carbomedics in addition we have an exclusive worldwide right and license to use carbomedics pyrolytic carbon technology to manufacture components for the ats mechanical heart valve we commenced selling the ats mechanical heart valve in international markets in in we received fda approval to sell the ats open pivot mechanical heart valve and commenced sales and marketing of our valve in the united states during we reorganized the company and began the process of rebuilding our sales and marketing teams both in the united states and internationally this rebuilding has been a significant factor in our operating expense levels since during and we developed and implemented a plan to ramp up our own manufacturing facility for pyrolytic carbon by the end of this process was substantially complete during we made our first investments outside the mechanical heart valve market we completed a global partnership agreement with cryocath technologies inc to market cryocaths surgical cryotherapy products for the ablation of cardiac arrhythmias cryocath developed a portfolio of novel products marketed under the surgifrost and frostbyte trade names which are used by cardiac surgeons to treat cardiac arrhythmias treatment is accomplished through the creation of an intricate pattern of lesions on the surface of the heart to block inappropriate electrical conduction circuits which cause the heart to be less effective when pumping blood and can lead to stroke heart failure and death unique to this technology is the use of cryothermy cold to create lesions the agreement with cryocath has resulted in revenues for ats since during we continued to expand our business outside the mechanical heart valve market we entered into an exclusive development supply and distribution agreement with genesee biomedical inc under which gbi develops supplies and manufactures cardiac surgical products to include annuloplasty repair rings and bands and accessories and we have exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell such products our agreement with gbi has produced revenues for us since in we completed the acquisition of all the voting and non voting stock of f therapeutics inc an early stage privately held medical device company at the forefront of the emerging field of minimally invasive open and closed chest tissue valve replacement the acquisition of f was a major step in the execution of our long standing vision of obtaining a leadership position in the major segments of the cardiac surgery market the acquisition was consummated pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger as amended the merger agreement under the terms of the merger agreement upon closing we paid each f stockholder its pro rata portion of an initial payment of shares of our common stock subject to certain adjustments in december we issued shares of common stock to f stockholders under the merger agreement upon obtaining the european ce mark on our enable aortic bioprosthesis sutureless tissue valve product in addition we are obligated under the merger agreement to make an additional contingent payment to f stockholders of up to shares of our common stock with shares issuable upon obtaining us fda approval on the enable product or fda or european ce mark approval for certain future key products acquired in the f acquisition on or prior to december milestone share payments may be accelerated upon completion of certain transactions involving these future key products the first generation tissue valve of the f portfolio the ats f aortic table of contents bioprosthesis has received both fda approval and the european ce mark and is available for sale in the united states europe and certain other international markets in december we received european ce mark approval of our second tissue valve the sutureless ats f enable aortic bioprosthesis which is intended to enable less invasive aortic valve replacement we are also developing an aortic tissue valve for use in beating heart procedures based in part on the characteristics of the next generation of enable valves first in human studies of this technology is targeted for and if successful commercialization of a beating heart solution could occur within one to two years thereafter also in we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with novare surgical systems inc novare novare is the owner of the enclose ii cardiac anastomosis assist device which is a device used by cardiac surgeons to attach a bypass vessel to the aorta during coronary artery bypass graft surgery under the terms of the agreement we held the exclusive right to market sell and distribute the enclose ii product in the united states germany france and the united kingdom we discontinued selling the enclose ii device in august in june we acquired the cryoablation surgical device business of cryocath the acquisition included the surgifrost frostbyte and surgifrost xl family of products for which we had served as cryocaths exclusive agent in the united states and distributor in certain international markets under the acquisition agreement we paid cryocath million upon closing of the transaction reduced by million subsequent to closing and million during upon the achievement of certain manufacturing transition milestones we also paid million in june two years after closing and agreed to pay up to million in contingent payments based on future sales of surgifrost xl an fda cleared and ce marked product designed to enable less evasive ablations based on the results of extensive bench and pre clinical testing as well as human feasibility studies the company discontinued development of the surgifrost xl product in late the company continues to develop less invasive procedures utilizing its existing set of tools the acquisition of the cryoablation surgical device business of cryocath enables us to leverage our current operating infrastructure and allows us to better address the rapidly growing cardiac arrhythmia market within cardiac surgery critical accounting policies and estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as set forth by the financial accounting standards board fasb in its accounting standards codification asc and applicable rules and regulations of the sec the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities at each balance sheet date we evaluate our estimates including but not limited to those related to accounts receivable inventories long lived and intangible assets and income taxes the critical accounting policies that are most important in fully understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations are discussed below revenue recognition policy a significant portion of our revenue in the united states and in our direct european sales operations is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals or with field representatives in these situations revenue is recognized at the time that the product has been implanted or used in all other instances revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped certain independent distributors in select international markets receive rebates against invoiced sales amounts in these situations we accrue for these rebates at the time of the original sale these rebates are treated as a reduction of revenue and have not been significant we include shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated using subjective judgments and estimates to establish this valuation account our distribution in international markets through independent distributors concentrates relatively large amounts of receivables in relatively few customer accounts we have successfully done business with most of these distributors for many years we monitor amounts that are not paid according to terms we attempt to accrue for potential losses due to non payment financial conditions in international markets can change very quickly and our allowance for doubtful accounts cannot anticipate all potential changes our allowance for table of contents doubtful accounts was approximately million at december and the allowance as a percentage of total accounts receivable was and at december and respectively inventory valuation inventories are recorded and relieved at the lower of manufacturing cost first in first out basis or market net realizable value we maintain allowances and reserves against certain finished goods and work in process inventories to cover obsolete and short shelf life product scrap and rework costs and resterilization costs for expired or near expired items these allowances and reserves totaled million and million at december and respectively goodwill and intangible assets we assess the carrying value of goodwill our only indefinite lived intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc intangibles goodwill and other we review goodwill for impairment annually as of the last day of the second quarter or more frequently if a change in circumstances or occurrence of events suggests the remaining value may not be recoverable the test for impairment requires management to make estimates about fair value which are based either on the expected present value of future cash flows or on other measures of value such as the market capitalization of the company if the carrying amount of the assets is greater than the measures of fair value impairment is considered to have occurred and a write down of the asset is recorded definite lived intangible assets consist of purchased technology and patents technology licenses and agreements trademarks trade names and distribution intangibles which are carried at amortized cost the company assesses definite lived intangible asset impairment in accordance with fasb asc property plant and equipment overall subsequent measurement if a triggering event occurs the company assesses the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets by reference to future gross profit cash flows from the underlying products utilizing the capitalized intangible assets as of december we completed impairment testing on all of our intangible assets and determined that the carrying value of our intangible assets including goodwill were not impaired were recoverable and that no impairment charges were necessary during we recorded an impairment charge of million related to licensing fee and development milestone payments made to a swedish research firm related to blood filtration technology for cardiac surgery procedures convertible debt and derivative instruments we account for embedded derivatives related to our convertible senior notes under fasb asc derivatives and hedging and applicable sec rules which require certain embedded derivative financial instruments to be bifurcated from the debt agreement and accounted for as a liability our convertible senior notes contain several embedded derivatives the valuation of derivatives requires management to make certain judgments and estimates including the potential future fair value of our common stock the probability of a change in control of the company and the probability that the debt may be put back to or called by us fair value measurements we apply fair value measurement accounting principles related to our convertible senior notes derivative liability goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities pursuant to fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc asc establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements asc defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for a discussion of the application of asc to specific assets and liabilities deferred tax assets we have incurred cumulative tax losses of approximately million the losses are carried forward for us and state corporate income taxes and can be used to reduce future taxable income as a result at december we had net deferred tax assets totaling approximately million we have recorded a full valuation allowance against these assets because of the limited lives of the carryforwards and our lack of earnings history which has resulted in our conclusion that it is not more than likely we will be able to utilize our loss carryforwards the ability to utilize a portion of our cumulative tax losses to offset future taxable income is subject to certain limitations under section and of the internal revenue code due to changes in the equity ownership of the company in addition fs tax loss carryforwards may also be limited by separate return limitation year rules table of contents stock based compensation we account for our stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of fasb asc stock compensation which requires all share based payments to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values we issue both stock options and restricted stock unit awards rsus to our employees the fair value of stock option grants is determined based on the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model the fair value of rsus is determined based on the closing market price on the award date recently issued accounting pronouncements

valve therapy surgical arrhythmia therapy surgical tools and accessories total heart valve therapy sales our largest product group consists of mechanical and tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products our mechanical heart valve products continue to be our primary product line and comprised approximately and of our total worldwide sales for and respectively and and of total heart valve therapy revenues in and respectively surgical arrhythmia therapy products consist of cryotherapy products for the ablation of cardiac arrhythmias we acquired this business from cryocath in june surgical tools and accessories consist primarily of cardiac anastomosis assist devices which we discontinued selling in august and thoracic port systems net sales for all periods have been favorably impacted by revenue from the acquisitions new products and new business initiatives and partnerships discussed above approximately of our worldwide revenue in was derived from products other than mechanical heart valves up from approximately in and in compared to worldwide heart valve therapy revenue increased in a primary driver of this increase was tissue heart valve revenue which increased in to million compared to million in due primarily to the limited us commercial launch of the companys first generation tissue valve product the ats f aortic bioprosthesis approved by the fda in october us tissue valve revenue comprised approximately of total tissue valve revenue for worldwide mechanical heart valve revenue for increased from due to stronger mechanical heart valve sales in asia and certain developing markets heart valve repair revenue increased in compared to due to the introduction of our semi rigid line of repair rings in as well as to continued sales growth of our existing repair ring products surgical arrhythmia therapy revenue for increased compared to cryotherapy products in general and cryomaze procedural growth in particular has benefited from the overall growth of the surgical ablation market and increased market acceptance of cryo energy cold as a preferred technology to perform cox maze lesion sets our total net sales increase for of was negatively impacted by approximately basis points related to lower foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar during approximately of our total sales for were invoiced in euros or other local currencies in european markets where we sell our products directly to hospitals compared to heart valve therapy revenue increased in compared to due primarily to higher international mechanical heart valve revenue which increased approximately in attributable to the expansion of direct selling operations in certain international markets and to stronger mechanical heart valve sales in developing markets us mechanical heart valve revenue in increased from the result of the introduction of a new mechanical valve offering in the ap valve which allowed us to take market share from competitors tissue heart valve revenue increased in to million driven primarily by a limited commercial launch in certain western european markets heart valve repair revenue increased in to million due to the introduction of our semi rigid line of repair rings in the first quarter of as well as to continued sales growth of our existing repair ring products table of contents surgical arrhythmia therapy revenue in of million increased compared to the most significant driver of the revenue increase was our acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of cryocath in june prior to this date we served as an agent and received a commission on the majority of the sales transactions after the acquisition our revenue is representative of end user pricing and the addition of more direct customers and geographies where cryocath had previously maintained direct distribution cryomaze procedural growth has benefited from the overall growth of the surgical ablation market and increased market acceptance of cryo energy as a preferred technology to perform cox maze lesion sets approximately basis points of our increase in net sales for compared to is attributable to higher average foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar approximately of our total sales in were invoiced in euros or other local currencies in european markets where we sell our products direct to hospitals cost of goods sold and gross profit compared to our gross profit percentage of net sales improved to an increase of basis points compared to in our gross profit benefited significantly from lower product manufacturing costs particularly for mechanical heart valves the cost declines are attributable primarily to higher manufacturing volumes as a result of increased demand enabling greater leverage of overhead and fixed costs and to product cost reduction initiatives lower product costs increased our gross profit percentage of net sales by approximately basis points compared to also contributing to the higher gross profit percentage were higher us average selling prices attributable in large part to tissue valves which increased our gross profit percentage of net sales by approximately basis points compared to partially offsetting the improved gross profit percentage of net sales were lower international selling prices due to foreign currency exchange rate changes and geographical sales mix shifts resulting from higher sales growth in lower margin developing countries which had a net unfavorable impact on our gross profit percentage of net sales of approximately basis points compared to the prior year compared to our gross profit was of revenue which represents an increase of basis points compared to in our gross profit both in dollars and in percentage of net sales benefited from lower cost internally manufactured mechanical heart valves as production significantly increased in to meet increased mechanical heart valve demand primarily in international markets greater leverage of manufacturing labor and overhead in resulted in a reduction in our mechanical heart valve cost of goods sold per unit compared to and contributed to an overall basis points increase in gross profit percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage of net sales also benefited by approximately basis points from higher international average selling prices associated with our expansion of direct selling efforts in certain european markets and appreciation of the euro against the dollar compared to direct sales of surgical cryotherapy products after our acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of cryocath in late june contributed basis points to our increase in gross profit percentage of net sales these sales included the gross up on certain sales for which we had served as an agent and received a commission prior to the acquisition and the addition of direct sales to other cryocath corporate customers partially offsetting the improved gross profit percentage of net sales were shifts in the overall sales mix both geographic and product related the most significant sales mix impact was related to product mix shifts during from higher margin mechanical heart valve products to lower margin cryotherapy and repair ring products which negatively impacted the overall gross profit percentage of net sales by approximately basis points compared to sales and marketing compared to in the united states our sales and marketing costs for increased over to million the increase reflects higher marketing program costs particularly related to the launch of the ats f aortic bioprosthesis tissue valve in the united states and marketing programs for our cryoablation business as well as additional marketing personnel field selling costs in the united states were higher by for compared to reflecting hospital sales program costs as well as higher table of contents independent sales agent and territory manager commissions connected with increased sales in the united states internationally our sales and marketing costs for increased over to million the increase is attributable primarily to severance and restructuring charges for our international sales organization of approximately million and to higher costs associated with our continuing investment in international markets evidenced by the establishment of a european support office in belgium during the second half of to continue the support and expansion of our direct sales operations in europe these increases were offset in part by the impact of lower euro to us dollar foreign exchange rates during than more than of our international sales and marketing costs are denominated in euros also offsetting the increases in sales and marketing costs discussed above were lower corporate incentive compensation accruals of million compared to in the united states our sales and marketing costs in increased approximately over the prior year to million the increase reflects costs for additional marketing personnel million higher marketing program costs million and higher achievement under incentive compensation plans million field selling costs in the united states were largely flat in compared to the prior year reflecting the turnover and reduction in field sales personnel offset by higher sales commissions in internationally our sales and marketing costs in increased approximately over to million the increase reflects our continued investment in international markets including the establishment of a european support office during the second half of to support the expansion of our direct sales operations in europe million and the commencement of direct sales activities in switzerland in the third quarter of million and higher achievement under incentive compensation plans million our higher international sales and marketing costs were also attributable to rising euro to us dollar foreign exchange rates which accounted for approximately one half of the year over year increase more than of our international sales and marketing costs in were denominated in euros research and development compared to research and development r d expenses for increased over to million the increase reflects stepped up investment in new product and technology programs particularly for minimally invasive tissue heart valve platforms and the forcefield program as well as headcount additions and the allocation of stock compensation expense to r d beginning in these cost increases were partially offset by lower clinical affairs expenses connected with the timing of clinical trial enrollments for tissue valves and lower corporate incentive compensation accruals of million r d expense fluctuations are generally related to the timing and stages of development project cycles compared to r d expenses for increased approximately compared to the prior year to million the increase in r d reflects higher clinical program and product approval costs for tissue heart valves million primarily related to the us approval of our first tissue valve offering the ats f aortic bioprosthesis and the enrollment ramp up in our enable clinical trial during also contributing to the higher r d costs were corporate bonus plan accruals million and increases in both r d personnel and programs million partially offsetting these increases in r d spending was a decline in tissue valve r d spending million and transfers of costs related to r d clinical product builds prototypes and testing devices million as our tissue valve products advanced through the regulatory approval process acquired in process r d in connection with our acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of cryocath we recorded a non recurring in process r d iprd charge of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding the cryocath acquisition including the purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price the iprd relates to surgifrost xl a product designed to enable less invasive stand alone or sole therapy solutions to treat atrial fibrillation table of contents based on the results of extensive bench and pre clinical testing as well as human feasibility studies we discontinued development of surgifrost xl product in late general and administrative compared to general and administrative g a expenses for decreased from the primary driver behind this result was significantly lower legal fees in million after the fourth quarter settlement of the litigation with carbomedics also contributing to lower g a expense was lower corporate incentive compensation accruals of million partially offsetting these decreases were higher consulting and outside services costs million and higher compensation and benefits expenses million in and we recognized total stock compensation expense of million and million respectively stock compensation expense has been allocated to cost of goods sold sales and marketing r d and g a expenses as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k the increase in stock compensation expense is attributable primarily to new equity grants and awards and to fewer forfeitures compared to g a expenses for increased million over to million major cost increases in g a expenses in were for legal fees primarily related to the carbomedics litigation of million and corporate incentive compensation plan accruals of million these cost increases were offset by million in employee severance costs and million of business development expenses incurred in which did not repeat in as well as million of lower consulting and outside services fees in in and we recognized total stock compensation expense of million and million respectively for and stock compensation expense was allocated to sales and marketing and g a expenses as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k the increase in stock compensation expense for over reflects primarily an increase in equity grants and awards in at higher closing stock prices litigation settlement in december we settled ongoing litigation with carbomedics which began in and was related to our supply agreement with carbomedics for certain mechanical heart valve components as part of the settlement we paid million to carbomedics million of which was paid in december and million of which was paid in april under the terms of the settlement we maintain all rights to manufacture market and sell our ats open pivot mechanical heart valve satisfaction of the settlement terms will conclude all related matters with carbomedics and preclude any future litigation on the matter in question see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information regarding the carbomedics litigation and settlement amortization of intangibles amortization expense includes amortization of our pyrolytic carbon technology license with carbomedics and amortization of the definite lived intangible assets acquired in our purchase of the surgical cryoablation business of cryocath and our acquisition of f see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information regarding our intangible assets and amortization of our definite lived intangible assets we estimate amortization expense for to total approximately million impairment of intangibles we made licensing fee and development milestone payments to erysave ab erysave a swedish research firm under an exclusive development and licensing agreement executed in for worldwide rights to erysaves parsus filtration technology for cardiac surgery procedures in july we were informed that erysave was in the process of declaring bankruptcy and they could not continue development work accordingly the million erysave license payments intangible asset was written off during fiscal table of contents net interest expense the primary components of our net interest expense are commitment fees and amortization of deferred financing costs related to the june subordinated credit agreement credit agreement and revolving credit facility credit facility with theodore c skokos interest on the million term loan term loan with silicon valley bank obtained in connection with the june acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of cryocath and interest on the million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes issued in interest expense on the convertible senior notes includes amortization of a deferred financing costs b the discount related to the implied value of common stock warrants sold with the convertible senior notes and c the discounts related to the bifurcated convertible senior notes derivatives see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information regarding all of these debt instruments compared to net interest expense for was relatively flat compared to reflecting lower interest on the declining principal balance of our loan with silicon valley bank offset by lower interest income on cash and investment balances and higher commitment fee and deferred financing costs related to the june credit facility with mr skokos compared to net interest expense for increased million over the prior year the increase was attributable in large part to a decrease in interest income on declining cash and investment balances during interest income in and was million and million respectively also contributing to the increase in net interest expense was interest on the june term loan with silicon valley bank obtained in connection with the cryocath asset acquisition net other income the following table summarizes our net other income for the years ended december and in thousands year ended december alta partners viii lp alta warrant liability gain loss convertible senior notes derivative liability gain net realized foreign currency transaction gains unrealized foreign currency gain loss related to intercompany balances with foreign subsidiaries other net other income in our june private equity placement in connection with the acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of cryocath we sold to alta a life sciences venture capital firm shares of our common stock and a seven year warrant to purchase up to shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share the company was required to treat the warrant as a liability pending approval of its shareholders at the companys annual meeting of shareholders to provide shares of common stock issuable to alta upon exercise of the warrant accordingly the fair value of the warrant was recorded as a liability on the date of issuance and marked to market at each quarter end at the annual meeting of shareholders in may we received shareholder approval to issue shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrant consequently the warrant liability was marked to market through the date of shareholder approval and the remaining liability was credited to additional paid in capital since we have recorded non operating other income for the change in fair value of the convertible senior notes derivative liability see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information regarding the convertible senior notes derivative liability net other income also includes net foreign currency transaction gains and losses including unrealized foreign currency gains and losses related to short term intercompany balances with foreign subsidiaries these gains and losses have increased since due to larger fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates table of contents income taxes our income tax expense for and relates to deferred income taxes connected with the deductibility of goodwill from the cryocath acquisition for tax purposes but not for book purposes and the uncertainty of the timing of its reversal for book purposes current income taxes for certain of our european sales and distribution subsidiaries and provisions for taxes resulting from open international tax audits in future years we will continue recognizing deferred income tax expense related to the cryocath goodwill over its tax life as long as there is no impairment of the goodwills recorded value through we have accumulated approximately million of net operating loss nol carryforwards for us tax purposes million related to f we believe that our ability to fully utilize the existing nol carryforwards could be restricted on a portion of the nol by changes in control that may have occurred or may occur in the future and by our ability to generate net income we are conducting a formal study of whether or to what extent past changes in control of ats impair our nol carryforwards we have recorded no net deferred tax asset related to our nol carryforwards and other deferred items as we currently cannot determine that it is more likely than not that this asset will be realized and we therefore have provided a valuation allowance for the entire asset net loss our net losses in and were million million and million respectively our decrease in net loss in compared to was due to significantly higher sales and gross profit the absence of the carbomedics litigation settlement expense and smaller changes in operating expenses and non operating income all of which are described in detail above our decrease in net loss in compared to was also due to significantly higher sales and gross profit as well as to the absence of acquisition related iprd in partially offset by higher operating expenses and the settlement of the carbomedics litigation all of which are described in detail above liquidity and capital resources cash cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million and million at december and december respectively operating activities during we received cash payments from customers of approximately million and made payments to employees and suppliers of approximately million included in our cash payments for was a million payment related to the settlement of the carbomedics litigation during we received cash payments from customers of approximately million and made payments to employees and suppliers of approximately million since we have incurred significant expenses to support the commercialization of ats products both in the united states and international markets have invested in new products and technologies and have completed strategic acquisitions and business partnerships to diversify our product portfolio as we grow sales in future periods better leverage our operating expenses and continue to drive declines in our product manufacturing costs we believe our operating losses will continue to decrease and we will move toward a cash flow breakeven on sales and eventually to full year profitability investing activities we purchased leasehold improvements property and equipment totaling million million and million during and respectively capital spending in focused on information technology manufacturing improvement projects and capitalized cryoablation hardware placed at hospitals a significant portion of our capital spending in was related to the addition of a surgical cryoablation production clean room at our plymouth minnesota location following the acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of cryocath table of contents our major investing activity since the beginning of has been the acquisition of the assets of the surgical cryoablation business of cryocath we paid million at the closing in june subsequently reduced by million and paid approximately million in transaction costs in june and august we paid to cryocath contingent acquisition payments totaling million due upon the successful transition of manufacturing operations from cryocath to us in june we made a million acquisition payment to cryocath due two years after the closing of the acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional details regarding this acquisition during we converted

security agreement loan agreement with silicon valley bank under the loan agreement as amended all ats assets are pledged as collateral and we are subject to certain financial covenants in june we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement whereby the bank provided for an million term loan which we used to repay then outstanding term loans and advances from the bank and to purchase the surgical cryoablation business from cryocath table of contents under the term loan as amended we made monthly payments of interest only from july through march and we began making monthly payments of principal plus interest effective april that continue until june accordingly we repaid million and million of principal on the term loan during and respectively we have the right to prepay all but not less than all of the outstanding term loan at any time so long as no event of default has occurred interest on the term loan accrues at a fixed rate per annum of equal to above the prime rate in

senior notes is due semi annually in april and october the convertible senior notes are convertible into common stock at any time at a fixed conversion price of per share subject to certain adjustments if fully converted the convertible senior notes would convert into approximately shares of our common stock we have the right to redeem the convertible senior notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest at any time on or after october and the investors have the right to require us to repurchase the convertible senior notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest on october in and accordingly we have reclassified the convertible senior notes from long term to current liabilities on our balance sheet at december on february we received a commitment letter for four year interest only first year term debt financing of approximately million from one of our directors theodore c skokos and the ted and shannon skokos foundation this financing will be used to call and retire the convertible senior notes and bank term loan together totaling approximately million as well as to provide general corporate working capital we expect to close the financing during the second quarter of when the notes are retired we expect to recognize a non cash debt restructuring charge of approximately to million related primarily to the unamortized discount on the notes cash management and funding of future operations we anticipate that operating costs will remain relatively high in comparison to sales during and will continue to require the use of cash to fund operations based upon the current forecast of sales and operating expenses we anticipate having sufficient cash to fund our operations however we may need to raise additional cash in or after to fund our strategic investments refinance long term obligations or to opportunistically add accretive products to our distribution network as identified in item a of this form k global economic turmoil may adversely impact our revenue access to the capital markets or future demand for our products all of which could affect our long term viability approximately of our revenue is derived from markets outside the united states and this revenue may be adversely impacted by large swings in foreign currency exchange rates and the availability of credit for our distributors in emerging markets maintaining adequate levels of working capital depends in part upon the success of our products in the marketplace the relative profitability of those products and our ability to control operating and capital expenses table of contents funding of our operations in future periods may require additional investments in ats in the form of equity or debt in addition as discussed above the holders of our million convertible senior notes have the option to require us to repurchase the convertible senior notes in october as discussed above we have recently obtained a commitment for term debt financing which will be used to call and retire the notes however if this financing is not consummated and the note holders exercise their repurchase option we would need to raise capital issue debt securities and or borrow to finance the repurchase of these notes any sale of additional equity or issuance of debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to obtain this additional financing when needed we may be required to delay reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities which could harm the growth of our business off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses operating results liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future payment obligations in thousands payments due by period less more than than total year years years years convertible senior notes payable bank term loan payable leases and other total includes interest payments the holders of our convertible senior notes have the option to require us to repurchase the convertible senior notes in october therefore the million face amount of the convertible senior notes has been classified on our balance sheet at december as a current liability cautionary statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that may include statements regarding intent belief or current expectations of ats and our management the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement we desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions accordingly we have identified in item a of this form k important risk factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected forecast estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports proxy statements registration statements and other written communications or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our officers and agents we do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair market value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline to minimize this risk our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments if any may be invested in a variety of securities including commercial paper money market funds and both government and non government debt securities the average duration of our investments has generally been less than one year due to the short term nature of these investments we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments in the united states the united kingdom france germany belgium the netherlands and switzerland we sell our products directly to hospitals in other international markets we sell our products to independent distributors who in turn sell to medical hospitals loss termination or ineffectiveness of distributors to effectively promote our product would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations transactions with us and non us customers and distributors other than in our direct selling markets in europe are entered into in us dollars precluding the need for foreign currency hedges on such sales sales through our french german and belgian distribution subsidiaries are generally denominated in euros sales to the united kingdom and switzerland are also made through our belgian distribution company and are denominated in pounds and swiss francs respectively therefore we are subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements we have not used foreign exchange contracts or similar devices to reduce this risk we will evaluate the need to use foreign exchange contracts or similar devices if sales in our european direct markets increase substantially
