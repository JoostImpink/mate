commission the following discussion also should be read in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k together with the above forward looking statements factors that may affect future results and aforementioned item a risk factors results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total net sales that such items represent in the consolidated statements of income years ended january net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses total selling general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense other income income before taxes provision for taxes net income fye versus fye net sales for the fiscal year ended january were million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of million or sales in the product recoverypollution control technologies reporting segment were million or million higher than the million of sales for the fiscal year ended january an increase of this sales increase in the current fiscal year was driven by higher sales in the i strobic air business unit attributable to a million order booked in the prior fiscal year and shipped in the current fiscal year and ii met pro environmental air solutions business units primarily attributable to the bio reaction product line index sales in the fluid handling technologies reporting segment totaled million or million higher than the million of sales for the fiscal year ended january an increase of the fiscal year ended january benefited from a million fybroc export order that was shipped and invoiced within the fiscal year as compared to a million fybroc export order that was substantially shipped and invoiced in the fiscal year ended january sales in the mefiag filtration technologies reporting segment totaled million essentially flat with sales for the year ended january resulting from a sales increase in our north america and china operations offset by a sales decrease in our european operation attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange translation compared with the prior year the industrial markets serviced by this reporting segment are primarily comprised of the automotive and housing industries sales in the filtrationpurification technologies segment were million or million lower than the million of sales for the fiscal year ended january a decrease of this decrease was due to lower demand in the keystone filter and pristine water solutions businesses compared with the same period last year as a result of price competition and continued weakness in the markets serviced by these business units foreign sales were million for the fiscal year ended january compared with million for the same period last year an increase of million or this increase was primarily attributable to a foreign sales increase of in the fluid handling technologies reporting segment due to the aforementioned fybroc export order and a increase in the product recoverypollution control technologies reporting segment income from operations for the fiscal year ended january was million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of million or income from operations in the product recoverypollution control technologies reporting segment was million or million lower than the million for the fiscal year ended january a decrease of the decrease in income from operations in this reporting segment was primarily related to three large contracts in the met pro environmental air solutions business unit which although contributing million in revenue were at an aggregate break even gross profit and higher general and administrative expense these adverse factors offset the higher gross profit margins in the strobic air business unit and bio reaction brand compared with the same period last year income from operations in the fluid handling technologies reporting segment totaled million or million higher than the million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of the increase in income from operations resulted from a increase in sales as well as higher gross profit margins within this reporting segment income from operations in the mefiag filtration technologies reporting segment totaled million essentially flat with the comparable fiscal year period income from operations in the filtrationpurification technologies segment was million or million lower than the million for the fiscal year ended january a decrease of the decrease in income from operations was primarily related to lower gross margins in the pristine water solutions business unit attributable to competitive pricing pressures in the municipal markets serviced by this business unit net income for the fiscal year ended january was million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of million or gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended january was compared with for the prior fiscal year the gross profit margin in our product recoverypollution control technologies and mefiag filtration technologies reporting segments as well as filtrationpurification technologies segment were lower as compared with the same period last year which offset higher gross profit margins in our fluid handling technologies reporting segment as compared with the same period last year selling expense was million for the fiscal year ended january compared with million for the prior fiscal year a decrease of million the decrease in selling expense was primarily attributable to lower payroll expense partially offset by increased advertising in the current year period compared to the prior year period selling expense as a percentage of net sales was for the fiscal year ended january compared with for the same period last year general and administrative expense was million for the fiscal year ended january compared with million in the prior fiscal year an increase of million this increase was due primarily to i healthcare and pension expenses which were million higher in the current year period compared with the same period last year and ii costs of approximately million related to separation expenses which included salary continuation stock option modification and transition expenses associated with the companys change in its chief financial officer compared with million of severance expense in the prior year period general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was for the fiscal year ended january compared with for the prior fiscal year index interest expense was approximately million for each of the fiscal years ended january and other income was million for the fiscal year ended january compared with million in the prior fiscal year a decrease of million the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to higher gains on foreign currency exchange in the prior year period compared to the current year period the effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended january and were and respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate from the previous year was primarily the result of a one time benefit attributable to deductible stock compensation expense resulting from a change in the status of outstanding stock options fye versus fye net sales for the fiscal year ended january were million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of million or sales in the product recoverypollution control technologies reporting segment were million or million higher than the million of sales for the fiscal year ended january an increase of the sales increase was due primarily to higher sales for all product brands within the met pro environmental air solutions business unit partially offset by lower sales for our strobic air systems that we attribute to among other factors elongated delivery schedules of booked orders delays in the timing of customer orders for large projects and reduced construction in the pharmaceutical university and other industries that purchase strobic airs products sales in the fluid handling technologies reporting segment totaled million or million higher than the million of sales for the fiscal year ended january an increase of the sales increase was due to higher sales for all product brands within this reporting segment a large percentage of the million increase over the previous year was attributable to the shipment of the million balance of a million order for fybroc brand pumps that was announced on october sales in the mefiag filtration technologies reporting segment totaled million or million higher than the million of sales for the year ended january an increase of the sales increase in the mefiag filtration technologies reporting segment was due to an increase in sales across all mefiag product lines which we attribute to an apparent improvement in the industrial markets serviced by this reporting segment which are primarily the automotive and housing industries sales in the filtrationpurification technologies segment were million or million higher than the million of sales for the fiscal year ended january an increase of this increase in sales was due primarily to increased demand in our keystone filter business unit partially offset by decreased demand in our pristine water solutions business unit as a result of price competition inclement weather in certain geographic areas and continued weakness in the municipal markets serviced by this business unit foreign sales were million for the fiscal year ended january compared with million for the same period last year an increase of compared with the prior fiscal year foreign sales increased in the fluid handling technologies reporting segment in the mefiag filtration technologies reporting segment and in the filtrationpurification technologies segment offset by a decrease of in the product recoverypollution control technologies reporting segment income from operations for the fiscal year ended january was million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of million or income from operations in the product recoverypollution control technologies reporting segment was million or million lower than the million for the fiscal year ended january a decrease of the decrease in income from operations in this reporting segment was primarily related to the following i lower sales for our strobic air systems ii lower gross profit margins experienced amongst all product brands within this reporting segment due primarily to product mix increases in material cost and competitive pricing pressures and iii severance expense of approximately million recognized in the companys second quarter ended july as a result of the company offering a voluntary employee early retirement program index income from operations in the fluid handling technologies reporting segment totaled million or million higher than the million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of the increase in income from operations resulted from a increase in sales and higher gross profit margins within this reporting segment income from operations in the mefiag filtration technologies reporting segment totaled million or million higher than the million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of the increase in income from operations in the mefiag filtration technologies reporting segment resulted from a increase in sales partially offset by lower gross profit margins income from operations in the filtrationpurification technologies segment was million or million lower than the million for the fiscal year ended january a decrease of the decrease in income from operations was related to decreased sales and lower gross margins in our pristine water solutions business unit the lower gross margins experienced in our pristine water solutions business unit was due primarily to increases in material cost and competitive pricing pressures net income for the fiscal year ended january was million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january an increase of million or gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended january was compared with for the prior fiscal year the gross profit margin in our product recoverypollution control technologies and mefiag filtration technologies reporting segments as well as the filtrationpurification technologies segment were lower as compared with the same period last year partially offset by higher gross profit margins in our fluid handling technologies reporting segment as compared with the same period last year selling expense was million for the fiscal year ended january compared with million for the prior fiscal year the slight increase in selling expense was primarily due to higher payroll expenses web and print advertising and exhibitions selling expense as a percentage of net sales was for the fiscal year ended january compared with for the same period last year general and administrative expense was million for the fiscal year ended january compared with million in the prior fiscal year an increase of million the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to i higher payroll expenses ii severance expense of approximately million recognized in the companys second quarter ended july as a result of the company offering a voluntary employee early retirement program and iii higher personnel acquisition expenses general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was for the fiscal year ended january compared with for the prior fiscal year interest expense was approximately million for each of the fiscal years ended january and other income was million for each of the fiscal years ended january and the increase in other income primarily related to a gain on foreign currency exchange the effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended january and were and respectively the increase in the effective tax rate of from the previous year was due primarily to an increase in stock option tax expense resulting from a reduction in the exercising of non qualified stock options from the previous year as well as due to a reevaluation of the companys fasb asc topic accrual liquidity and capital resources the companys principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations borrowings under existing lines of credit and access to credit markets the companys principal uses of cash are operating expenses capital expenditures working capital requirements dividends and debt service management expects that the companys current cash and cash equivalent balances cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity will be sufficient to support the companys planned operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future and at least the next twelve months index the companys cash and cash equivalents were million on january compared with million on january a decrease of million the decrease in the companys cash and cash equivalents is primarily the net result of quarterly cash dividend payments aggregating to million investment in property and equipment of million and payments on debt totaling million partially offset by the positive cash flows provided by operating activities of million the companys cash flows from operating activities are also influenced in part by the timing of shipments and negotiated standard payment terms including retention associated with major projects as well as other factors including changes in inventories and accounts receivable balances cash flows provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended january amounted to million compared with million in the prior year fiscal period a decrease of million the decrease in cash flows from operating activities as compared with the same period last year was due principally to the following i a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million compared with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million for the same period last year or a period to period cash outflow of million and ii a decrease in customers advances of million compared with an increase in customers advances of million for the same period last year or a period to period cash outflow of million these cash outflows were partially offset by the following i a decrease in inventories of million compared with an increase in inventories of million for the same period last year or a period to period cash inflow of million ii a decrease in accrued pension retirement benefits of million compared with a decrease in accrued pension benefits of million for the same period last year or a period to period cash inflow of million iii net income increasing by million from the same period last year and iv an increase in accounts receivable of million compared with an increase in accounts receivable of million in the same period last year or a period to period cash inflow of million cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended january amounted to million compared with cash flows used in investing activities of million for the same period last year a decrease of million the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities is due to proceeds from maturities of investments of million compared with proceeds from maturities of investments of million for the same period last year or a period to period cash inflow of million financing activities during the fiscal year ended january utilized million of available resources compared with million utilized during the prior year period the increase in cash utilized amounting to million is principally due to increases in payments for dividends and debt somewhat offset by lower borrowings under the companys mefiag bv subsidiarys line of credit compared with the same period last year the board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per share payable on march june and september to shareholders of record at the close of business on march june and august respectively the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share payable on december and march to shareholders of record at the close of business on december and march respectively the company and its subsidiaries have access to million of uncommitted unsecured domestic and foreign lines of credit subject to terms thereof of which million has been committed for standby letters of credit as of january the existing domestic credit agreements include two financial covenants a liabilitytangible net worth ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio at january we were in compliance with both financial covenants the required liabilitytangible net worth ratio which measures total liabilities to tangible net worth is a maximum of times at january and our liabilitytangible net worth ratio using this measure was times and times respectively the required fixed charge coverage ratio which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility compared with the aggregate of interest expense debt service dividends and capital expenditures is a ratio of at least times at january and our fixed charge coverage ratio using this measure was times and times respectively our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events in addition the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision whereby a default on one debt obligation of the company in excess of a specified amount also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument as of january we were in compliance with all such provisions as of january approximately million of the companys cash and cash equivalents were held by certain non us subsidiaries as well as being denominated in foreign currencies the repatriation of cash and cash equivalent balances from non us subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however such cash and cash equivalent balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level deferred income taxes have not been provided on the unremitted earnings of such non us subsidiaries because it is managements intention to reinvest such earnings in non us subsidiaries for the foreseeable future index management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity or an increase in liquidity beyond the historical rate of increase in addition other than items discussed there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources the company accounts for its defined benefit plans in accordance with fasb asc topic compensation retirement benefits asc topic requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans the plans as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the funded status recognized through other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur asc topic also requires us to measure the funded status of the plans as of the year end consolidated balance sheets date we froze the accrual of future benefits for our salaried and non union hourly employees effective as of december and for our union hourly employees effective as of december as of january our unfunded pension liability was approximately million and we expect to contribute approximately million to the pension plans during the fiscal year ending january as part of our commitment to the future the company expended million and million on research and development in the fiscal years ended january and respectively the company will continue to invest in new product development to maintain and enhance its competitive position in the markets in which we participate capital expenditures will be made to support operations and expand our capacity to meet market demands the company intends to finance capital expenditures in the coming year through cash flows from operations and will secure third party financing when deemed appropriate off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item of regulation s k that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital resources or capital expenditures that are material to investors contractual obligations the following table summarizes the companys contractual cash obligations as of january by required payment periods total contractual payments due by long term purchase operating interest pension cash period debt obligations leases expense contributions obligations less than year years years more than years total future expected obligations under the companys pension plans are included in the contractual cash obligations table above up to but not more than five years the companys pension plan policy allows it to fund an amount which could be in excess of the pension cost expensed subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations the company currently projects that it will contribute million to its pension plans during the fiscal year ending january index critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes a majority of its revenues from product sales or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue from contracts related to the companys subsidiary bio reaction industries inc representing the minority of revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared with the estimated total contract costs for each contract this method is used because management considers contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts related to bio reaction industries inc depreciation and amortization property plant and equipment finite lived intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives useful lives are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill the company assesses the qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect the fair value of goodwill carried in its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently when an indicator of impairment exists quantitative impairment testing involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units which comprise our operating segments in calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows method we rely on a number of assumptions including sales and related gross margin projections operating margins anticipated working capital requirements and market rate of returns used in discounting projected cash flows these assumptions are based upon market and industry forecasts our business plans and historical data inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors the discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents a weighted average cost of capital available to the company during the fiscal year ended january we performed a quantitative impairment analysis on each of the companys reporting units that carry goodwill on their balance sheets in each case the fair value exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by a significant amount except for pristine water solutions which represents of the total company wide goodwill there was a decline in net sales and operating profit of our pristine water solutions business unit during the current fiscal year that we attribute to a number of factors including raw material price increases increased price competition product mix continued weaknesses in pristine water solutions principal market the municipal market and inclement weather in certain geographic areas which affected product demand for pristine water solutions the carrying value as of january and amounted to million and million respectively the fair value of pristine water solutions as of january and totaled million and million respectively as a result the fair value exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by million and million at january and respectively therefore as of january pristine water solutions goodwill was not impaired because of market conditions and or potential changes in strategy and product portfolio it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition based on current projections a one percent decrease in revenue growth a one percent decrease in gross margin or a one percent increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value for pristine water solutions by million million and million respectively additionally the company cannot predict the occurrence of unknown events that might adversely affect the reportable value of goodwill related to pristine water solutions index flex kleen which initially performed well after being acquired by met pro thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets as of january flex kleens fair value exceeded its carrying amount but not by a significant amount due to improving performance during the year ended january flex kleens fair value increased and exceeded its carrying amount by a significant amount as of january this improvement is attributable to general strengthening in the markets served by flex kleen our impairment models provide that pristine water solutions and flex kleens performance needs to continue to improve on an annual basis for a number of fiscal years in order for us not to be potentially required to write off some or all of their goodwill if in the future we determine that there has been an impairment of pristine water solutions and or flex kleens goodwill we will be required to record a non cash charge to earnings to the extent of the impairment during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets is determined which would have an adverse impact upon our results of operations and financial position we anticipate that pristine water solutions and flex kleens performance during the fiscal year beginning february will be at a level that will not indicate impairment of their goodwill but this expectation is a forward looking statement where the actual results may not be as we presently anticipate pension obligations the determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts those assumptions are described in note of the january consolidated financial statements included in form k and include among others the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets a decrease in the discount rate by basis points would have had an immaterial impact on net periodic pension expense but would have increased the projected benefit obligation by million a decrease in the long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points would have increased net periodic pension expense by million but would have had no impact on the projected benefit obligation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense recent accounting pronouncements in july the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment this asu simplifies how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment which improves consistency in impairment testing requirements among long lived asset categories this amended standard permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value for assets in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards the guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september early adoption is permitted the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows in february the fasb issued asu reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu an update to asc topic comprehensive income the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december an entity should provide the required disclosures retrospectively for all comparative periods presented as this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure the adoption of this standard will not impact the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows index item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks we are exposed to certain market risks primarily changes in interest rates market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates for met pro corporation these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates we do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes the carrying value of the companys total long term debt and current maturities of long term debt at january was million market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the companys estimated weighted average borrowing rate at january although most of the interest on the companys debt is indexed to either the libor or euribor market rates there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the companys total debt for such a hypothetical change the company has only a limited involvement with derivative financial instruments the company has one interest rate swap agreement to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates effective april the company entered into a fifteen year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount equal to the balance on the bond payable maturing april the company swapped the ninety day libor for a fixed rate of as of january the effective fixed interest rate was as a result of the swap agreement plus the interest rate floor provision of basis points the interest rate swap agreement is accounted for as a cash flow hedge that qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness in accordance with fasb asc topic derivatives and hedging there was no hedge ineffectiveness as of january the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement resulted in a decrease in equity of net of tax and net of tax at january and respectively these results are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss section of shareholders equity see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information the company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the netherlands canada the peoples republic of china and chile in the past we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues operating expenses and earnings due to the fact that most of our foreign sales are denominated in the local currency we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in the fiscal year ending january index
