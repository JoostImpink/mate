of indicators to evaluate our sales and gross profit performance including among others same store sales sales per store sales per selling square foot percentage of total sales by department inventory shrink and department gross margins we focus on increasing same store sales sales per selling square foot and sales per store through programs which provide greater customer service and better store level execution promotional activities and merchandising including product placement and adjacencies private label and enhanced use of the pathmark advantage card as well as high sanitation standards our operating expenses are primarily incurred from selling general and administrative costs almost of these costs are for labor and labor related benefits internally we focus on a variety of indicators to evaluate our expense performance including among others labor costs including labor hours and hourly labor rates and labor related expenses such as welfare costs pension costs payroll taxes and workers compensation costs selling general and administrative expenses other than labor and labor related costs include occupancy expenses supplies and customer accident claims among others as has been our practice in the past we will continue to evaluate the profitability strategic positioning impact of potential competition and sales growth potential of all our stores on an ongoing basis we may from time to time make decisions regarding acquisitions closures relocations or renovations in accordance with such evaluations we completed store renovations during fiscal and plan to complete store renovations during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data dollars in millions weeks endedfebruary weeks

which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs net of vendor allowances and rebates gross profit in fiscal was billion or of sales compared to billion or of sales in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales of in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher margins in the grocery nonfoods produce and meat departments lower inventory shrink in the perishable departments and lower logistic costs partially offset by lower pharmacy margins associated with the new medicare part d program we estimated that million of the

million charge related to a merchandising and store initiative a million charge related to stock based compensation expense and a million charge related to a review of strategic alternatives which resulted in the yucaipa investment the balance of the increase in sga of million in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the estimated impact of the extra week of million higher utility expenses of million higher self insured workers compensation and general liability claims of million higher rent and real estate taxes of million higher incentive expenses of million higher technology expenses of million higher bank charges of million and higher repairs of million partially offset by lower store payroll of million and lower advertising expenses of million depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of million in fiscal was million higher than the million in fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal compared to fiscal

from the sale of real estate the balance of the increase in sga in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the following factors supply and utility expenses increased by of sales due to higher oil prices welfare pension and medical expenses increased by of sales and store labor expenses increased by of sales due to contractual increases impairment of goodwill and long lived assets based on the evaluation of our goodwill and long lived assets performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal we concluded there was no impairment in fiscal compared to a non cash impairment charge of million in fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of million in fiscal was million higher than the million in fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal

weeksendedfebruary weeksendedjanuary weeksendedjanuary cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher cash used for operating assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase in operating earnings the increase in cash used for operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the transfer in fiscal of our disbursing account to the same financial institution we utilize for our depository accounts thereby allowing for the right of offset which resulted in the reduction of cash and book overdrafts of million at february and the timing of our february semi annual senior subordinated notes interest payment of million and our prepaid rent payments of million such payments were made prior to february in fiscal but subsequent to january in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a higher net loss excluding the non cash goodwill and long lived assets impairment charge in fiscal an increase in the deferred income tax benefit and lower cash generated by operating assets and liabilities the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to net sales of marketable securities partially offset by higher capital expenditures including technology investments the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower capital expenditures including technology investments partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the fiscal proceeds from the issuance of the purchased securities net of debt repayments see debt service and liquidity below partially offset by increased borrowings under the working capital facility the increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the proceeds related to the issuance of the purchased securities net of debt repayments see debt service and liquidity below debt service and liquidity on june pursuant to the purchase agreement we issued the purchased securities to the investors for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash we received million for the purchased securities net of million of costs directly attributable to the offering we used million of the net proceeds to pay down our working capital facility borrowings and million to defease our mortgage borrowings the remaining net proceeds were invested in short term cash investments and have been used for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures during fiscal we entered into the credit agreement which expires on october and consists of a million working capital facility including letters of credit working capital facility and a million term loan term loan the credit agreement contains certain covenants which among other things place limits on the incurrence of additional indebtedness issuance of cash pay preferred stock repurchase of company stock incurrence of liens sale leaseback transactions hedging activities sale or discount of receivables investments loans advances guarantees with affiliates asset sales acquisitions mergers and consolidations changing lines of business repayments of other indebtedness amendments to organizational documents and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements the credit agreement also contains provisions permitting us to increase the size of the working capital facility by million and to repay and subsequently reborrow any portion of the term loan in each instance subject to certain conditions the credit agreement further provides that we must maintain a minimum inventory level of million that the maximum annual cash capital expenditures in a fiscal year are limited to the lesser of million or an amount equal to our consolidated ebitda for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus any unused cash capital expenditures in the immediately preceding fiscal year up to a maximum of million and that we shall not at any time permit the ratio of credit extensions to consolidated ebitda calculated on a trailing four fiscal quarters basis at the end of any fiscal quarter to be more than for each fiscal quarter the senior leverage ratio as used in the credit agreement credit extensions mean the sum of the principal balance of all outstanding borrowings thereunder million under the term loan and million under the working capital facility as of february and the amount of outstanding letters of credit million as of february based on the senior leverage ratio at the end of fiscal we have full availability under the working capital facility after giving effect to credit extensions of million also the credit agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends and contains customary events of default including without limitation payment defaults material breaches of representations warranties and covenants certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency and a change of control excluding the purchase by the investors of the purchased securities we were in compliance with all credit agreement covenants as of february we believe that cash flows from operations supplemented by unused borrowing capacity under the credit agreement and the availability of capital lease financing will be sufficient to provide for our debt service requirements working capital needs and capital expenditure program for at least the next fiscal year however in the event that cash flows from operations continue to decrease we may decide to limit our future cash capital expenditure program and subject to the senior leverage ratio our ability to utilize the full amount available under the working capital facility could be limited there are no credit agency ratings related triggers in either the credit agreement or in the indenture related to the senior subordinated notes the indenture that would adversely impact the cost of borrowings annual amortization of principal or related debt maturities borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates equal to libor plus a premium that ranges between to depending on the average remaining availability under the credit agreement our interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement is currently at libor plus under the term loan we are required to make a balloon payment of million on october the working capital facility also expires on october the weighted average interest rate in effect on all borrowings under the term loan was during fiscal and during fiscal all of the obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our owned subsidiaries except our nonguarantor subsidiaries which are comprised of four owned and consolidated single purpose entities each of these single purpose entities owns the real estate on which a supermarket leased to pathmark is located the obligations under the credit agreement and those of the subsidiaries guaranteeing the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the companys tangible and intangible assets including without limitation intellectual property real property including leasehold interests and the capital stock in each of these subsidiaries we have outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes including million issued at a premium which mature on february and pay cash interest semi annually on february and august the indenture contains a number of restrictive covenants including a restriction on our ability to declare cash dividends on our common stock we were in compliance with all senior subordinated notes covenants as of february contractual obligations and commitments we enter into a variety of legally binding obligations and commitments in the normal course of our business the table below presents our long term contractual obligations and commitments which represent known future cash payments that we will be required to make under existing contractual arrangements some amounts are based on managements estimates and assumptions and amounts actually paid may vary from those reflected below the following table presents contractual obligations as of february in millions payments due by fiscal years total and and thereafter long term debt obligations interest on debt obligations capital lease obligations interest on capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other liabilities total debt and capital lease obligations include principal payments only operating lease obligations net of sublease income of million are million in addition to the purchase obligations reflected in the table above we enter into supply contracts to purchase products for resale in the ordinary course of business this category of contracts covers a broad spectrum of products and sometimes includes specific merchandising obligations relative to those products these supply contracts typically include either a volume commitment or a fixed expiration date pricing terms based on the vendors published list price termination provisions and other standard contractual considerations our obligation related to these contracts is typically limited to return of unearned allowances and therefore no amounts have been included above purchase obligations shown above relate to the outsourcing of a major portion of our distribution trucking and information systems functions through long term agreements as noted below we have a supply agreement with cs expiring in january pursuant to which cs supplies substantially all of our grocery frozen and perishable merchandise requirements under our arrangement with cs we negotiate prices discounts and promotions with vendors we pay cs a per case upcharge and have annual minimum case commitments the table above reflects the minimum upcharge during fiscal the products supplied from cs accounted for over of all of our supermarket inventory purchases this agreement may only be terminated for cause or certain events of bankruptcy by either party in february we entered into a seven year extension of our existing outsourcing agreement with ibm which commenced in to continue to provide a wide range of information systems services under the agreement expiring in january ibm provides data center operations mainframe processing business applications and systems development to enhance our customer service and efficiency the charges under this agreement are based upon the services requested at predetermined rates we may terminate this agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge we have an agreement expiring in january with ghi to provide us with trucking services under this arrangement there is an annual fixed fee in addition to transportation charges the fixed fee is reflected in the table above we may terminate this agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge other liabilities include self insured obligations unfunded pension liabilities and post retirement and post employment obligations off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we have assigned to third parties various leases related to former businesses that we sold as well as former operating pathmark supermarkets the assigned leases when the assigned leases were assigned we generally remained secondarily liable with respect to these lease obligations as such if any of the assignees were to become unable to continue making rental payments under the assigned leases under certain circumstances we could be required to assume the lease obligation as of february our records indicate that assigned leases may still have term remaining however we have no way of knowing in some instances if such assigned leases are still actually in effect or have been terminated by our assignees or their successors assuming that each assigned lease is still in effect and that each respective assignee became unable to continue to make rental payments under an assigned lease an event we believe to be remote management estimates our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases to be approximately million which could be partially or totally offset by reassigning or subletting such leases we have a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of february of million which represents certain guarantees attributable to our secondary liability in connection with assigned leases assigned after december additionally in connection with the sale of our trucking business to ghi and distribution operation to cs ghi and cs agreed to continue making contributions to the local teamsters pension fund the fund a multi employer pension plan with respect to ghi we agreed that in the event ghi were to withdraw from the fund to indemnify ghi under certain circumstances against all liabilities it would have arising from such a withdrawal we also agreed to provide ghi with a letter of credit to secure the potential indemnification obligation as of february we have caused our bank to issue stand by letters of credit in favor of ghi or the fund in the aggregate amount of million under the agreement with ghi we have agreed to adjust said letters of credit up or down annually to reflect any change in the maximum estimated amount of the fund withdrawal liability attributable to ghi provided that any annual increase in said letters of credit will not exceed million provided further that in the event of a change in control excluding the yucaipa investment a failure to provide an annual increase in the letters of credit when due or a material adverse change in our financial condition we would be required to furnish an increased letter of credit equal to the full amount of the estimated fund withdrawal liability attributable to ghi less any outstanding letters of credit in favor of ghi or the fund the estimated fund withdrawal liability attributable to ghi as of august the funds last completed fiscal year according to the fund actuary is million with respect to cs we agreed that in the event cs were to withdraw from the fund to indemnify cs under certain circumstances against liabilities it would have arising from such a withdrawal provided however that our indemnification obligation is limited to an amount not to exceed what our fund withdrawal liability would have been as of august we are also a party to a variety of contracts under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts purchase and sale agreements leases financial agreements and various other agreements under these contracts we may provide routine indemnification relating to representations and warranties or personal injury matters the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined historically we have not made a significant payment for these indemnifications we had outstanding letters of credit of million as of february of which million were standby letters of credit covering primarily self insured or performance obligations the remaining million were commercial letters of credit supporting purchases of imported products capital expenditures capital expenditures including technology investments were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal we completed store renovations during fiscal we opened two new stores one of which was a replacement for a closed store closed four stores and completed eight store renovations during fiscal our capital expenditure plan is to invest approximately million in store renovations and in technology investments critical accounting policies our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty we believe that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial statements as a whole as well as our related discussion and analysis presented herein while we believe that these accounting policies are based on sound measurement criteria actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts the accounting policies and related risk described in this report are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates goodwill impairment we perform our annual evaluation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year based on our fiscal and fiscal evaluations we concluded there were no impairments of our goodwill in fiscal we concluded that there was a million impairment of our goodwill since such impairment analysis is based on economic and business assumptions the goodwill impairment analysis in the future could be affected by changes in these business and economic conditions changes in consumer spending the competitive environment in which we operate and other risks detailed elsewhere in this report impairment of long lived assets it is our policy to assess the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment on an individual store basis to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows based on our fiscal and fiscal assessments we concluded there were no impairments of our long lived assets in fiscal we concluded that there was an impairment of million since our estimates project cash flow several years into the future they could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions pension plans for all our pension plans pension income was million for fiscal pension expense was million including a million charge related to the retirement incentive program and executive separations for fiscal and pension income was million for fiscal pension income and expense are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions the expected return on assets of the pathmark stores inc pension plan the qualified plan represents the weighted average of expected returns for each asset category which have been developed using information from a number of third party consultants and long term historical data on returns for different asset categories and inflation we also considered the qualified plans historical year and year compounded returns of and respectively which have exceeded broad market returns over comparable periods indicating a significant premium has been gained through active management of plan assets based on these factors and the asset allocation discussed below we elected to use a expected return on plan assets in determining pension cost for fiscal this was consistent with fiscal and fiscal our assumption was net of expected plan expenses payable from the trust fund which were less than of plan assets the expected long term rate of return on our qualified plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers with an expected long term rate of return of and with fixed income managers with an expected long term rate of return of both were net of expected plan expenses payable from the trust fund because of market fluctuation our actual asset allocation as of december was with equity managers and with fixed income managers we believe however that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate with equity managers and with fixed income managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate a reduction in our expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets holding all other factors constant would have decreased pension income during fiscal by approximately million we base our determination of pension expense or income in part on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market value of assets as of february due to offsetting gains and losses the market value and market related value of assets differed by less than the discount rate used reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income investments on our annual measurement date december and is subject to change each year the discount rate was determined by matching on an approximate basis a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a portfolio of high quality bonds as of the measurement date to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the projected benefit obligation and solving for a single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation the discount rate was as of february and as of january pension income is sensitive to the discount rate and salary increase assumptions used a decrease in the discount rate used would have decreased fiscal pension income by approximately million a increase in the salary increase assumption would have decreased fiscal pension income by approximately million based on an expected return on plan assets assumption of a discount rate of and our various other relevant current assumptions we estimate that our pension income for all pension plans combined will approximate million for fiscal million for fiscal and million for fiscal actual pension income in the future will depend on future investment performance changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plans the value of our qualified plan assets has increased from million at december to million at december the actual return in excess of that expected and the increase in the discount rate have raised the overfunded status of our qualified plan net of benefit obligations from million at december to million at december we believe that based on our actuarial assumptions and due to the overfunded status of our qualified plan we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our qualified plan for at least the next three years in september the fasb issued sfas no which requires us to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in our statement of financial position we are also required to disclose information about certain effects on net periodic benefit costs for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations we adopted sfas no as of february resulting in a reduction in the funded pension asset of million a decrease in net deferred income taxes of million a decrease in postretirement benefit obligations of million an increase in unfunded pension liabilities of million and a reduction in stockholders equity of million sfas no also requires us to measure the funded status of our plan as of the date of our fiscal year end statement of financial position as we have always used the calendar year for measurement this will result in a change in our consolidated financial statements we are not required to adopt this change until our fiscal year ending february we do not expect that the adoption of this portion of sfas no will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements self insured claims liabilities and postemployment benefits we are self insured for claims relating to customer associate and vehicle accidents as well as certain associate medical and disability benefits and except for associate medical insurance we maintain third party excess insurance coverage for such claims it is our accounting policy to record a self insured liability as determined actuarially on a consistent basis based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported discounted at a risk free interest rate of all claims and their related liabilities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis any actuarial projection of losses concerning such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates litigation trends benefit levels and claim settlement patterns at february liabilities for self insured claims and benefits were million and for postemployment benefits were million new accounting pronouncements in june fasb interpretation fin no accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no was issued this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with sfas no accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for benefits to be realized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement fin no is effective for our fiscal year beginning february the cumulative effect of adopting fin no will be recorded in accumulated deficit and other accounts as applicable we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin no and have not yet completed our determination of the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position in june the fasb ratified the consensus of eitf no how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation the scope of this issue includes any tax assessed by a government authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing activity between a seller and a customer eitf no states that the income statement presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue on either a gross included in revenues at cost basis or a net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed effective for our fiscal year beginning february we will continue to use the net basis for presentation in september the fasb issued sfas no fair value measurements which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions under this statement fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy this statement is effective for our fiscal year beginning february with early adoption permitted we are in the process of evaluating this statement but do not expect that the adoption of sfas no will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in september the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements this bulletin provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that when all relevant quantitative and qualitative facts are considered is material sab no was effective for our fiscal year ended february the adoption of sab no did not result in any adjustments to our consolidated financial statements in february the fasb issued sfas no the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas no this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement which is consistent with the fasbs long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments sfas no is effective for our fiscal year beginning february we are in the process of evaluating this statement but do not expect that the adoption of sfas no will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates variable rate debt outstanding under our term loan was million on february during fiscal the average interest rate in effect on borrowings under our term loan was a change in interest rates applied to the million balance of floating rate term loan debt would affect pre tax annual results of operations by approximately million our senior subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and are therefore not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations the principal objective of our treasury management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs as part of our risk management we may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future
