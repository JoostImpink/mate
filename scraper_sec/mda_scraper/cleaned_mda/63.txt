acquired the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units which have been determined to be the companys reportable segments or one level below the reportable segments in certain instances using a fair value method based on managements judgments and assumptions or third party valuations the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in estimating the fair value the company uses multiples of earnings based on the average of published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics and applies to the companys average of historical and future financial results in certain instances the company uses discounted cash flow analyses or estimated sales price to further support the fair value estimates the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc fair value measurement the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair valuethe assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations the primary assumptions used in the impairment tests were managements projections of future cash flows although the companys cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unitindefinite lived other intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment testswhile the company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the impairment tests are reasonable and no impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived assets existed during fiscal years and different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and therefore impairment charges could be required which could be material to the consolidated financial statements the company reviews long lived assets including tangible assets and other intangible assets with definitive lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount may not be recoverable the company conducts its long lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with asc impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc general intangibles other than goodwill and asc costs of software to be sold leased or marketed asc requires the company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows if the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals asc requires intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities to be considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts during the period that those assets are considered indefinite lived they shall not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an entity shall recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess asc requires the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product be compared to

percentage of completion poc method of accounting this method of accounting recognizes sales and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded primarily in accounts receivable likewise contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded primarily in deferred revenue changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed monthly sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catch up method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values estimated losses are recorded when identified claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement the use of the poc method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods the periodic reviews have not resulted in adjustments that were significant to the companys results of operations the company continually evaluates all of the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the poc method of accounting the building technologies solutions business enters into extended warranties and long term

arrangements into separate deliverables and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the relative selling price method in order to estimate relative selling price market data and transfer price studies are utilized revenue recognized for security monitoring equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the non contingent up front consideration received at the time of installation since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services for transactions in which the company retains ownership of the subscriber system asset fees for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized on a straight line basis over

valuations the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in estimating the fair value the company uses multiples of earnings based on the average of published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics and applies to the companys average of historical and future financial results in certain instances the company uses discounted cash flow analyses or estimated sales price to further support the fair value estimates the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc fair value measurement the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from september to july the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date
