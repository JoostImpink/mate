are to a large extent liquid in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however inflation may result in increases in the companys expenses such as employees compensation and benefits occupancy and equipment costs and communications expense which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates this may adversely affect transaction volume which in turn may adversely affect the companys results of operations
