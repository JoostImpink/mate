to reflect future events or developments overview the company assists in the design and manufacture of sophisticated electronic and electromechanical systems and devices and complex interconnect systems on a contract basis for its customers engineering and manufacturing facilities are located in arkansas missouri oklahoma pennsylvania texas and wisconsin the companys customers conduct business in a variety of markets with significant revenues from customers in the defense natural resources industrial medical commercial aerospace and computing and communications markets as a contract manufacturer revenues are impacted primarily by the volume of shipments in the particular period the company provides information about its end markets to demonstrate the diversity of its customer base which the company believes helps to reduce potential volatility in its revenue stream however the company does not target customers in individual markets but rather targets companies whose manufacturing requirements match the services and capabilities the company provides within all end markets gross profit margins vary widely by customer and by contract the most significant factors influencing profitability in a particular period are the mix of contracts with deliveries in that period and the volume of sales in relation to the companys fixed costs during that period delivery schedules are generally determined by the companys customers the significant factors that influence the profitability of the individual contracts include i the competitive environment in which the contract was bid ii the experience level of the company in manufacturing these particular products iii the stability of the design of the products and iv the accuracy of the companys original cost estimates as reflected in the sale price for the products the company has a centralized sales organization though the selling and marketing personnel have a customer and prospective customer focus they are not limited to exclusively developing a specific end market on november eclipse aviation corporation eclipse a customer of the company announced that it filed a petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on march the eclipse bankruptcy was converted to chapter liquidation the eclipse bankruptcy negatively impacted the companys financial results for the fiscal year ended june as described in more detail throughout the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements filed with this report the end market for sales to eclipse was commercial aerospace the company acquired pensar electronic solutions llc pensar on december therefore the companys financial results for the fiscal year ended june includes weeks of pensar activity compared with weeks of activity for the fiscal year ended june the impact of the pensar acquisition is described in the results of operations section that follows results of operations ndash fiscal ndash ndash backlog in thousands fiscal year ended change fiscal june june june vs defense natural resources industrial medical commercial aerospace government systems other total backlog the backlog at june increased million from june the million increase in natural resources backlog is primarily attributable to strong bookings with wind power generation and oil and gas customers the million increase in industrial backlog is primarily comprised of stronger bookings of electronic assemblies used in high performance semiconductor test equipment and systems million and additional bookings of electronic and electromechanical assemblies used in capital equipment for glass container fabrication systems million the backlog at june included million from the pensar acquisition absent the pensar acquisition the backlog from june to june decreased by million the million reduction in commercial aerospace is primarily related to the eclipse bankruptcy described in more detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements the remaining decline in backlog results from reduced orders in several market sectors due to the economic downturn the million increase in medical backlog primarily resulted from the pensar acquisition approximately million of the backlog at fiscal year end is scheduled to ship beyond the next months pursuant to the shipment schedules of the contracts that comprise backlog this compares with million at fiscal year end net sales in thousands fiscal year ended change fiscal june june june vs defense industrial natural resources medical commercial aerospace government systems other total net sales the pensar acquisition which occurred in fiscal year and is described in note to the consolidated financial statements contributed million of net sales in the months ended june compared with million in the six months ended june the overall increase in pensars sales in fiscal year versus fiscal year is primarily due to the fact that pensar was included in the companys results for approximately half of the fiscal year and for the entire fiscal year the million increase in sales for this facility during fiscal versus fiscal included an increase of million in the natural resources market a million increase in the industrial market and a million increase in the medical market for the months ended june excluding the impact of the pensar acquisition sales decreased million versus the comparable period a year earlier the overall economic downturn was the primary contributor to the sales decline excluding the impact of the pensar acquisition fiscal sales to defense customers decreased million sales to natural resources customers decreased million sales to industrial customers increased million sales to commercial aerospace customers decreased million and sales to other customers decreased million versus fiscal excluding the impact of the pensar acquisition the million decrease in defense sales in fiscal year related to reduced shipments under several contracts to produce cable and electronic assemblies for a variety of defense applications including military aircraft missile systems radar systems and shipboard programs sales to customers in the natural resources market were negatively impacted by the overall economic downturn this downturn resulted in a million decrease in natural resources sales primarily in the oil and gas sector government systems sales were down as the company completed a large multi year contract for baggage scanning equipment in december commercial aerospace sales decreased due to the bankruptcy of eclipse described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements the pensar acquisition contributed million of net sales to the fiscal year the overall decrease in net sales between fiscal years and was primarily due to the economic downturn the million increase in defense sales in fiscal year related to several contracts to produce cable and electronic assemblies for a variety of defense applications including military aircraft missile systems radar systems and shipboard programs sales to customers in the natural resources market were negatively impacted by the overall economic downturn this downturn was partially offset by million of natural resources sales from the pensar acquisition in the wind power generation sector the increase in medical sales was driven by million of sales from the pensar acquisition government systems sales were down as the company completed a large multi year contract for baggage scanning equipment in december commercial aerospace sales decreased due to the bankruptcy of eclipse described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements sales to the companys largest customers represented of total revenue in fiscal versus in fiscal and in fiscal the companys top three customers and their relative contribution to fiscal year sales were owens illinois inc american superconductor and raytheon company the companys top three customers for fiscal year were owens illinois inc raytheon company and

cost estimates cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june increased million compared with the prior fiscal year driven by the fiscal year sales increase of million gross profit for fiscal year increased million and gross profit margin was up basis points versus the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit margin from in fiscal year to in fiscal year was primarily driven by the impact of the write down of inventory related to the eclipse program described in note to the consolidated financial statements the fiscal write down of eclipse related inventory increased cost of sales and reduced gross profit by million this write down reduced the reported gross profit margin by basis points in addition gross profit for fiscal year was positively impacted by for the payment of a claim on a contract completed in the third quarter of fiscal year this represents the final settlement of this claim the acquisition of pensar added cost of sales of million and gross profit of million in the fiscal year ended june the pensar acquisition generated gross profit margin of in the fiscal year ended june excluding the pensar acquisition the gross profit margin would have been for the months ended june cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june decreased million compared with the prior fiscal year driven by the fiscal year sales decline of million gross profit for fiscal year was down million and gross profit margin was down basis points versus the prior fiscal year the decline in gross profit margin from in fiscal year to in fiscal year was primarily driven by the write down of inventory related to the eclipse program described in note to the consolidated financial statements and the acquisition of pensar in addition gross profit margin was negatively impacted by a percentage drop in sales that exceeded the percentage drop in indirect manufacturing expenses the acquisition of pensar added cost of sales of million and gross profit of million in the fiscal year ended june the pensar operation generated gross profit margin of in the fiscal year ended june the pensar gross profit margin was negatively impacted by the step up of work in process and finished goods inventory as part of the allocation of the acquisition purchase price which added to cost of sales recorded by the pensar operation excluding the pensar operation the gross profit margin would have been for the months ended june a decrease of basis points compared with the same period in fiscal absent the eclipse write off and the impact of the pensar acquisition the gross profit margin would have been for the fiscal year ended june which is basis points higher than the fiscal year ended june during the fiscal year ended june the companys gross margin was negatively impacted by higher than anticipated labor and material costs on certain early stage long term contracts that were not fully recoverable from the companys customers and start up expenses on a significant new contract for the assembly of heavy mechanical products in the industrial market in addition in the fiscal year ended june the company recorded costs of to account for the actual and anticipated loss on current and future shipments on one particular defense program for which the company experienced significant design changes selling and administrative expense dollars in thousands fiscal year ended change fiscal june june june vs selling and administrative expense percent of net sales basis pts selling and administrative expense increased by million for the months ended june compared with the months ended june the selling and administrative expenses for the pensar acquisition were million in the months ended june compared with million in the six months ended june excluding the impact of the pensar acquisition selling and administrative expense decreased for the months ended june compared with the months ended june the decrease in expenses is primarily attributable to the million write off of the eclipse accounts receivable expensed during the second quarter of fiscal in addition fringe benefit expense decreased professional service fees decreased employee relocation expenses decreased and amortization expense decreased compared with the year ago period these decreases were offset by increases in incentive compensation of million higher salaries and wages of and tax expense of in fiscal year the major factors increasing selling and administrative expense compared with fiscal were the write off of the eclipse accounts receivable of million the acquisition of pensar of million and higher salaries and wages due to head count and wage inflation of million partially offsetting these increases were lower incentive compensation expense of million lower commissions of and reduced personnel recruiting and relocation expenses of interest expense in thousands fiscal year ended change fiscal june june june vs interest expense interest expense increased in fiscal year from the prior year due to the full year impact of carrying the debt associated with the pensar acquisition the debt level decreased in the fiscal year period ended june as a result of principal payments interest expense decreased in fiscal year from the prior year due to lower average interest rates income tax expense in thousands fiscal year ended change fiscal june june june vs income tax expense the effective income tax rate prior to discrete items for fiscal was compared with and in fiscal years and respectively during the first quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a reduction to income tax expense from a correction in the apportionment factor for state income tax returns for fiscal years through and an increase in other tax expense included in selling and administrative expense of after tax for a gross receipts tax that relates to fiscal years through the company determined that the amounts related to prior fiscal years were not material to all prior fiscal years and therefore recognized the adjustments during the first quarter of fiscal year the net impact of both adjustments to net earnings was an increase of for the months ended june which had a impact on basic and diluted earnings per share the impact on full year net earnings for fiscal year is not material net earnings and earnings per share amounts in thousands except per share data fiscal year ended june june june net earnings basic net earnings per share diluted net earnings per share fiscal year ended june june june average common shares outstanding basic dilutive options and nonvested shares adjusted average common shares outstanding diluted all outstanding stock options and nonvested shares at june june and june were dilutive the stock options expire in various periods through the company has awarded certain key executives nonvested shares tied to the companys fiscal year financial performance the compensation expense related to these awards is recognized quarterly the nonvested shares vest over the next two fiscal years liquidity and capital resources cash flow in thousands fiscal year ended june june june net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents the companys operations generated million of cash in the months ended june compared with million in the months ended june the pensar acquisition generated positive operating cash flows of million for the months ended june and million for the six months ended june excluding the impact of pensars operating cash flow the primary driver of the million reduction in operating cash flow in the months of fiscal versus the same period a year earlier was a million reduction in cash received from customers excluding pensar customers this results from lower sales in the months ended june exclusive of the pensar acquisition compared with the same fiscal period in the prior year the lower receipts were offset by a million reduction in disbursements for inventory purchases and other costs of production the lower inventory purchases and other production costs were primarily driven by the reduction of sales volume for the months ended june exclusive of the pensar acquisition and a reduction of purchases of long lead materials in addition the cash used for payroll related expenditures decreased by million in the months ended june compared with the months ended june as a result of a reduction in the incentive compensation paid during fiscal year compared with incentive compensation paid in fiscal year the million decrease in cash used by the companys investing activities in the months ended june versus the months ended june was driven by the million investment in the pensar acquisition made in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year capital expenditures were million in the months ended june these expenditures relate primarily to facility improvements at the houston joplin and tulsa plants capital expenditures were million in the months ended june primarily related to the companys million purchase of the tulsa manufacturing facility which had been leased in prior years and the million purchase of surface mount technology equipment to expand the companys capabilities in pittsburgh and tulsa the million decrease in cash provided by financing activities in the months ended june versus the months ended june reflects the second quarter of fiscal borrowing of million of senior debt and million of short term borrowings to acquire the assets of pensar in addition the company made debt payments during the months ended june of million versus debt payments of million in fiscal year in fiscal year the company paid down million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility the companys operations generated million of cash in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the pensar acquisition generated positive operating cash flow of million for fiscal year the primary driver of the increased operating cash flow was a million reduction in disbursements for inventory purchases and other costs of production the lower inventory purchases and other production costs were primarily driven by the reduction of sales volume in fiscal year exclusive of the pensar acquisition and a reduction of purchases of long lead time materials this increase in net cash provided by operations was partially offset by a reduction of cash receipts from trade receivables of million and a reduction of cash received from cash advances from customers of million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year in addition the cash used for payroll related expenditures increased by million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year income tax payments made during fiscal year were million lower than in fiscal the companys investing activities used million in fiscal year compared with million used in fiscal year the primary driver was the million used to acquire pensar see note to the consolidated financial statements in addition capital expenditures used million including the companys million purchase of the tulsa manufacturing facility which had been leased in prior years also the company purchased million of surface mount technology equipment to expand its capabilities in tulsa and pittsburgh the million increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the million of senior term debt used to finance the pensar acquisition capital structure the company entered into a senior secured loan agreement on december amended on january the following is a summary of certain provisions of the agreement bull the agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million which is available for direct borrowings or letters of credit the facility is based on a borrowing base formula equal to the sum of of eligible receivables and of eligible inventories as of june there were no outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility as of june letters of credit issued were million leaving an aggregate of up to million available under the revolving credit facility this credit facility matures on december bull the agreement provides for an aggregate million term loan with quarterly principal payments beginning in september of million increasing to million in september and increasing to million in september the balance is due on december bull interest on the revolving facility and the term loan is calculated at a base rate or libor plus a stated spread based on certain ratios for the fiscal year ended june the average rate was approximately bull all loans are secured by substantially all the assets of the company other than real estate bull the company must comply with covenants and certain financial performance criteria consisting of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda in relation to debt minimum net worth and operating cash flow in relation to fixed charges the company was in compliance with its borrowing agreement covenants as of and during the fiscal year ended june to mitigate the risk associated with interest rate volatility the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on january this pay fixed receive floating rate swap limits the companys exposure to interest rate variability and allows for better cash flow control the swap is not used for speculative purposes under the original agreement the company fixed the interest payments to a base rate of plus a stated spread based on certain ratios the beginning notional amount is million which will amortize simultaneously with the term loan schedule in the associated loan agreement and will mature on december on september the company made an additional payment in conjunction with the first principal payment under the loan agreement dated december this additional payment required a restructuring of the interest rate swap agreement as a result the fixed base rate under the revised agreement increased to this rate will apply until the swap matures on december the interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedging instrument and the company has formally documented designated and assessed the effectiveness of the interest rate swap the financial statement impact of ineffectiveness for the fiscal year ended june was immaterial fair value the company considered the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents securities and other current assets and liabilities including accounts receivable and accounts payable to approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments the company has considered amounts outstanding under the long term debt agreements and determined that carrying amounts recorded in the financial statements are consistent with the estimated fair value as of june additionally the interest rate swap agreement further described above has been recorded by the company based on the estimated fair value as of june at june the company recorded a liability of classified within other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and accumulated other comprehensive loss of net of deferred income tax effects of relating to the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement the company has classified its financial assets and liabilities using a three level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date as follows bull level ndash inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets bull level ndash inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument bull level ndash inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement the companys interest rate swap is valued using a present value calculation based on an implied forward libor curve adjusted for the companys credit risk and is classified within level of the valuation hierarchy as presented

principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements the company believes there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates the companys senior management discusses the accounting policies described below with the audit committee of the companys board of directors on a periodic basis the following discussion of critical accounting policies is intended to bring to the attention of readers those accounting policies that management believes are critical to the companys consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosures it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys significant accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june revenue recognition and cost of sales the companys revenue is derived from units and services delivered pursuant to contracts the company has a significant number of contracts for which revenue is accounted for under the percentage of completion method using the units of delivery as the measure of completion this method is consistent with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic formerly the statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the percentage of total revenue recognized from contracts under the percentage of completion method is generally of total revenue in any given quarter these contracts are primarily fixed price contracts that vary widely in terms of size length of performance period and expected gross profit margins under the units of delivery method the company recognizes revenue when title transfers which is usually upon shipment of the product or completion of the service the company also sells products under purchase agreements supply contracts and purchase orders that are not within the scope of asc topic the company provides goods from continuing production over a period of time the company builds units to the customer specifications based on firm purchase orders from the customer the purchase orders tend to be of a relatively short duration and customers place orders on a periodic basis the pricing is generally fixed for some length of time and the quantities are based on individual purchase orders revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no revenue recognition revenue is recognized on substantially all transactions when title transfers which is usually upon shipment therefore revenue for contracts within the scope of asc topic and for those not within the scope of asc topic is recognized when title transfers which is usually upon shipment or completion of the service however the cost of sales recognized under both contract types is determined differently the percentage of completion method for contracts that are within the scope of asc topic gives effect to the most recent contract value and estimates of cost at completion contract costs generally include all direct costs such as materials direct labor and subcontracts and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to the contracts learning or start up costs including tooling and set up costs incurred in connection with existing contracts are charged to existing contracts the contract costs do not include any sales marketing or general and administrative costs revenue is calculated as the number of units shipped multiplied by the sales price per unit the company estimates the total revenue of the contract and the total contract costs and calculates the contract cost percentage and gross profit margin the gross profit during a period is equal to the earned revenue for the period multiplied by the estimated contract gross profit margin thus if no changes to estimates were made the procedure results in every dollar of earned revenue having the same cost of earned revenue and gross profit percentage this method is applied consistently on all of the contracts accounted for in accordance with asc topic the company periodically reviews all estimates to complete as required by the authoritative guidance and the estimated total cost and expected gross profit are revised as required over the life of the contract any revisions to the estimated total cost are accounted for as a change of an estimate a cumulative catch up adjustment is recorded in the period of the change of the estimated costs to complete the contract therefore cost of sales and gross profit in a period includes a a cumulative catch up adjustment to reflect the adjustment of previously recognized profit associated with all prior period revenue recognized based on the current estimate of gross profit margin as appropriate and b an entry to record the current period costs of sales and related gross profit margin based on the current period sales multiplied by the current estimate of the gross profit margin on the contract cumulative adjustments are reported as a component of cost of sales for contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method managements estimates of material labor and overhead costs on long term contracts are critical to the company due to the size length of time and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated material costs historical labor performance trends business base and other economic projections factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk performance trends asset utilization and anticipated labor rates the development of estimates of costs at completion involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts estimates of each significant contracts value and estimate of costs at completion are reviewed and reassessed quarterly changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which the change in estimate is made when the current estimate of costs indicates a loss will be incurred on the contract the total anticipated loss is recognized in that period due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions estimates or circumstances may adversely or positively affect future financial performance in summary the cumulative gross profit margin recognized through the end of the current period on a contract will equal the current estimate of the gross profit margin on the contract multiplied by the contract revenues recognized through the end of the current period the current period gross profit will equal current period sales multiplied by the expected gross profit margin on a percentage basis on the contract plus or minus any net effect of cumulative adjustments to prior period sales under the contract in addition when there is an anticipated loss on a contract the entire loss is recorded in the period when the anticipated loss is determined the loss is reported as a component of cost of sales therefore the cumulative gross profit margin recognized through the end of the current period on a contract with an estimated loss will equal the current estimate of the gross profit margin on the contract multiplied by the contract revenues recognized through the end of the current period plus the provision for the additional loss on contract revenues yet to be recognized the current period gross profit on a contract with a loss reserve will equal current period sales at a gross profit margin plus or minus any net effect of cumulative adjustments to the loss reserve based on any changes to the estimated total loss on the contract this method of recording costs for contracts under asc topic is equivalent to alternative a as described in paragraph of asc topic the contracts that are not subject to percentage of completion accounting are not subject to estimated costs of completion cost of sales under these contracts are based on the actual cost of material labor and overhead charged to each job the contract costs do not include any selling and administrative expenses the company generally performs the work under fixed price arrangements so the profit on the contract may be influenced by the accuracy of the estimates used at the time a particular job is bid as reflected in the sales price for the product including material costs inflation labor costs both hours and rates complexity of the work and asset utilization inventories inventories other than work in process inventoried costs relating to those contracts accounted for under percentage of completion accounting are carried at the lower of cost or market value inventoried costs relating to contracts accounted for under percentage of completion accounting are stated at the actual production cost including overhead tooling and other related non recurring costs incurred to date reduced by the amounts identified with revenue recognized on units delivered selling and administrative expenses are not included in inventory costs inventoried costs related to these contracts are reduced as appropriate by charging any amounts in excess of estimated realizable value to cost of sales the costs attributed to units delivered under these contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced this average cost utilizes as appropriate the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition in accordance with industry practice inventories include amounts relating to long term contracts that will not be realized in one year since the inventory balance is dependent on the estimated cost at completion of a contract inventory is impacted by all of the factors described in the revenue recognition and cost of sales section above inventoried costs related to those contracts not accounted for under percentage of completion accounting are carried at the lower of cost or market in addition management regularly reviews all inventory for lower of cost or market value issues to determine whether any write down to the lower of cost or market value is necessary various factors are considered in making this determination including expected program life recent sales history predicted trends and market conditions if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management inventory write downs may be required for the fiscal years ended june june and june expense for the write down of inventory to lower of cost or market value charged to income before income taxes was million million and million respectively this expense does not include the million charge related to the eclipse bankruptcy recognized in the second quarter of fiscal as described in the overview section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of june of each fiscal year as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances during the fiscal year indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable potential impairment of goodwill is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss may be required to be recorded the company evaluates whether any triggering events have occurred during the fiscal year such as a significant decrease in expected cash flows at a reporting unit or changes in market or other business conditions that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in addition the company monitors its market capitalization compared with the carrying value of the company the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in accordance with fasb asc topic intangibles ndash goodwill and other asc under guidelines established by fasb asc topic segment reporting asc the company operates as one operating segment however the goodwill impairment analysis is performed at a reporting unit level a reporting unit is one level below an operating segment as defined by asc goodwill is recorded on three of the companys reporting units the goodwill was a result of purchase accounting during the acquisition of these reporting units the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units based on a combination of a market approach and an income approach the income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model and the market approach is based on market data for a group of guideline companies the company also considers its market capitalization on the date of the impairment testing compared with the sum of the fair values of all reporting units including those without goodwill recorded the discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of each reporting unit the future cash flow forecasts for each reporting unit are based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as expected future revenue and expense growth rates working capital needs at each reporting unit and future capital expenditures required to meet the revenue growth the discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit which considers the risk inherent in each reporting unit the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of june and concluded that no impairment charges were required total goodwill at june was million goodwill is recorded at three of the companys reporting units based on the on the annual impairment test completed as of june the company determined that the fair value of two of the reporting units which represented million of the total goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting units the remaining reporting unit which was acquired in december had goodwill of million at june the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of this unit by more than however this is a relatively recent acquisition that was purchased prior to the economic slowdown and the disruptive events in the credit markets the estimates and assumptions made in the companys estimate of the fair value of this reporting unit are inherently subject to significant uncertainties many of which are beyond the control of the company and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved the primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumptions regarding discount rate utilized revenue growth expected operating profit margins and working capital requirements the following is a summary analysis of the significant assumptions used by the company to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit using the income approach and how the assumptions were developed discount rate the discount rate represents the expected return on capital and is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the reporting unit the discount rate used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit was this rate considers the risk inherent in the projections used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit this rate takes into account the uncertainty about the expected revenue growth of the reporting unit and expected operating margins as well as the past performance of the reporting unit a change in the discount rate of would indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit remains in excess of the carrying value of the unit however it would indicate that the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the carrying value of the reporting unit would be less than revenue growth assumptions projected annual growth assumptions are based on the companys and its peers historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the electronic manufacturing services ems industry the long term expected growth rate for the ems industry is seven percent the company expects sales growth rates for this reporting unit to exceed the long term industry average of seven percent during the next five years as the company recovers from the economic slowdown in fiscal years and the growth rates will then normalize to industry rates and the company used a terminal growth rate of to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow analysis the company expects the growth rates for the reporting unit to exceed the long term growth rate of the ems industry because the company expects that in fiscal year and fiscal year existing customers of the reporting unit will recover to their sales rates prior to the economic slowdown and the company believes that with access to the companys larger sales force and more competitive financial strength the reporting unit will be able to attract new customers and gain additional business from existing customers operating profit margin assumptions the forecasted operating profit used in the income approach for the reporting unit is expected to improve in the future years as a result of implementing lean efficiency improvements leveraging of the company wide purchasing agreements and leveraging fixed costs working capital assumptions and capital expenditures working capital requirements were forecasted based on the reporting units historical performance and considering industry averages capital expenditures were forecasted based on current spending plans for the next two fiscal years and on industry averages thereafter the company also used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit the company utilizes the guideline public company method in which valuation pricing multiples are derived from the market share prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit and that are actively traded on a free and open market the derived multiples are then applied to the reporting units financial metrics producing
