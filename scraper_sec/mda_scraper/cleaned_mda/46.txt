cash flow as defined as of august the company was not permitted to pay dividends see note to the consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the companys financial position and results of operations these estimates judgments and assumptions are based on the companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of the current facts and circumstances management believes that its estimates judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available at the time this report was prepared to the extent there are material differences between estimates judgments and assumptions and actual results the financial statements will be affected management has reviewed the accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors the estimates that management believes are the most important to the financial statements and that require the most difficult subjective and complex judgments included the following evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable hedging activities benefit plans long lived assets valuation of goodwill self insurance program income taxes stock based compensation a description of each of these follows evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management makes judgments about the companys ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables that the company may not be able to collect penford estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience known troubled accounts industry trends table of contents economic conditions how recently payments have been received and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers if the estimates do not reflect the companys future ability to collect outstanding invoices penford may experience losses in excess of the reserves established see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging activities penford uses derivative instruments primarily exchange traded futures contracts to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of commodities used in the manufacturing processes in the united states the company relies upon exchange settlement to address the default risk exposure penford has elected to designate these activities as hedges for cash flow hedging activities this election allows the company to defer gains and losses on those derivative instruments until the underlying exposure affects earnings for fair value hedging activities the gain or loss on the derivative instruments offset gains or losses on the hedged item the requirements for the designation of hedges are very complex and require judgments and analyses to qualify as hedges as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these judgments and analyses include an assessment that the derivative instruments used are effective hedges of the underlying risks if the company were to fail to meet the requirements to qualify for derivative accounting or if these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges the company would be required to mark these contracts to fair value at each reporting date through current earnings effective august the company discontinued hedge accounting treatment for corn futures contracts as the hedging relationship no longer met the requirements for hedge accounting see note to the consolidated financial statements benefit plans penford has defined benefit plans for some employees providing retirement benefits and coverage for retiree health care qualified third party actuaries assist management in determining the recorded liabilities expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans management makes several estimates and assumptions in order to measure the expense and funded status including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities rates of return on plan assets rates of compensation increases employee turnover rates anticipated mortality rates and increases in the cost of medical care the company makes judgments about these assumptions based on historical investment results and experience as well as available historical market data and trends however if these assumptions are wrong it could materially affect the amounts reported in the companys future results of operations disclosure about these estimates and assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements see defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans below long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using an income approach discounted cash flows or a market based approach estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic and industry specific conditions product pricing sales volume and capital expenditures there can be no assurance that managements current projections of cash flows will be achieved or that an impairment charge will not be required in the future an impairment charge could be material to the companys financial position and results of operations table of contents valuation of goodwill penford is required to assess on an annual basis whether the value of goodwill reported on the balance sheet has been impaired or more often if conditions exist that indicate that there might be impairment these assessments require extensive and subjective judgments to assess the fair value of goodwill while the company engages qualified valuation experts to assist in this process their work is based on the companys estimates of future operating results and allocation of goodwill to the business segments if future operating results differ materially from the estimates the value of goodwill and profitability could be adversely impacted self insurance program the company maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation and group health liability costs the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future losses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claim occurrences and changes that could occur in actuarial assumptions the financial results of the company could be significantly affected if future claims and assumptions differ from those used in determining these liabilities income taxes the determination of the companys provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws the companys provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state taxing jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances and the companys change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate the determination of the need for a valuation allowance on the companys net deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future taxable income the timing of the tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and feasible tax planning strategies the company evaluates the requirement for a valuation allowance each quarter a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the tax return position will be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement the liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because the company is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the various tax filing positions management believes that the judgments and estimates it uses in evaluating its tax filing positions are reasonable however actual results could differ and the company may be exposed to significant gains and losses and the companys effective tax rate and cash flow in a given financial statement period could be materially affected see note to the consolidated financial statements stock based compensation the company provides compensation in the form of stock options or restricted shares of common stock to employees and non employee directors under its long term incentive plan share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense utilizing the accelerated multiple options approach over the requisite service period of the award which equals the vesting period determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of the share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment including estimating stock price volatility forfeiture rates the risk free interest rate dividends and expected option life see note to the consolidated financial statements table of contents if circumstances change and the company uses different assumptions for volatility interest dividends and option life in estimating the fair value of stock based awards granted in future periods stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimated therefore if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from those estimated the companys results of operations could be materially impacted contractual obligations as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements the company is a party to various debt and lease agreements at august that contractually commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future purchase obligations at august represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations incurred during the companys normal course of business for commitments to purchase goods and services for production and inventory needs such as raw materials supplies manufacturing arrangements capital expenditures and maintenance the terms of the majority of these obligations allow the company or its suppliers the option to cancel or adjust the requirements based on business needs the following table summarizes such contractual commitments at august in thousands after total long term debt and capital lease obligations postretirement medical defined benefit pensions operating lease obligations purchase obligations represent estimated contributions to the unfunded postretirement medical plan in amounts needed to fund expected benefit payments for participants through fiscal based on actuarial assumptions the company is

either the libor index rate or the prime rate and the outstanding amount of debt and is not included herein off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the companys financial condition changes in financial conditions revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans penford maintains two defined benefit pension plans and one defined benefit postretirement health care plan in the united states in fiscal the company amended its defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees to cease the further accrual of participant benefits pension expense for fiscal decreased by approximately million due to the amendment the most significant assumptions used to determine benefit expense and benefit obligations are the discount rate and the expected return on assets assumption see note to the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used by penford table of contents the discount rate used by the company in determining benefit expense and benefit obligations reflects the yield of high quality aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency corporate bonds whose cash flows are expected to match the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments benefit obligations and expense increase as the discount rate is reduced the discount rates to determine net periodic expense used in and reflect the changes in bond yields over the past several years lowering the discount rate by basis points would increase pension expense by approximately million and other postretirement benefit expense would change by an insignificant amount during fiscal bond yields declined and penford decreased the discount rate for calculating its benefit obligations at august as well as net periodic expense for fiscal to the expected long term return on assets assumption for the pension plans represents the weighted average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid pension expense increases as the expected return on plan assets decreases in developing the expected rate of return the company considers long term historical market rates of return as well as actual returns on the companys plan assets and adjusts this information to reflect expected capital market trends penford also considers forward looking return expectations by asset class the contribution of active management and management fees paid by the plans the plan assets are held in qualified trusts and anticipated rates of return are not reduced for income taxes the expected long term return on assets assumption used to calculate net periodic pension expense was for fiscal a basis point decrease increase in the expected return on assets assumptions would increase decrease pension expense by approximately million based on plan assets at august the expected return on plan assets used in calculating fiscal pension expense is unrecognized net loss amounts reflect the difference between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions unrecognized net losses in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining service life of active employees as of august unrecognized losses from all sources were million for the pension plans and million for the postretirement health care plan amortization of unrecognized net loss amounts is expected to increase net pension expense by approximately million in fiscal amortization of unrecognized net losses is not expected to increase net postretirement health care expense in fiscal penford recognized pension expense of million million and million in fiscal years and respectively penford expects pension expense to be approximately million in fiscal the company contributed million million and million to the pension plans in fiscal years and respectively penford estimates that it will not be required to make minimum contributions to the pension plans during fiscal the company recognized benefit expense for its postretirement health care plan of million million and million in fiscal years and respectively penford expects to recognize approximately million in postretirement health care benefit expense in fiscal the company contributed million million and million in fiscal years and to the postretirement health care plan and estimates that it will contribute million in fiscal future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various assumptions related to the participants in the defined benefit plans will affect future benefit expense and liabilities the company cannot predict what these changes will be recent accounting pronouncements accounting
