market committee fomc decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate from to in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation at its meeting in january hawaiis council on revenues lowered its forecast for growth in the state general fund tax revenue in fiscal year from to while the economy is still performing well the councils decision to lower the estimate was based on the expectation of slower economic growth than in the past year and uncertainty about the future the hotel employee strike which started in early october and impacted thousands of hotel workers ended after nearly two months the partial federal government shutdown then took effect in late december until january when a stopgap bill was passed and signed to temporarily reopen the government through february most of the states federal employees are defense related and were not impacted by the shutdown the two most popular visitor attractions hawaii volcanoes national park on the island of hawaii and the uss arizona memorial at pearl harbor remained open during the shutdown with the support of alternative funding sources potential risks to the hawaii economy include visitor infrastructure constraints tight labor markets paired with moderate income gain and high housing costs creating inflationary pressures international trade tariffs and natural disasters also remain a source of great uncertaintyliquidity and capital resources as a result of the tax act utility property is no longer eligible for bonus depreciation consequently the initial cash requirement for future capital projects will generally increase approximately because of the loss of the immediate tax benefit from bonus depreciation the company believes that its ability to generate cash both

market risk or credit risk support to the company or the utilities or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with the company or the utilitiesmaterial estimates and critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses actual results could differ significantly from those estimatesmaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations contingencies and litigation income taxes regulatory assets and liabilities electric utility unbilled revenues allowance for loan losses and fair value management considers an accounting estimate to be material if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the assumptions selected could have a material impact on the estimate and on the companys results of operations or financial conditionin accordance with sec release no cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies management has identified the accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the companys financial statements that is management believes that the policies discussed below are both the most important to the portrayal of the companys results of operations and financial condition and currently require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments the policies affecting both of the companys two principal segments are discussed below and the policies affecting just one segment are discussed in the respective segments section of material estimates and critical accounting policies management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the hei audit committee and as applicable the hawaiian electric audit committeefor additional discussion of the companys accounting policies see note of the consolidated financial statements and for additional discussion of material estimates and critical accounting policies see the electric utility and bank segment discussions below under the same headingpension and other postretirement benefits obligations the companys reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future experience for example retirement benefits costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels the level of contributions to the plans earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets and changes made to the provisions of the plans costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions including the expected return on plan assets the discount rate and mortality the companys accounting for retirement benefits under the plans in which the employees of the utilities participate is also adjusted to account for the impact of decisions by the puc changes in obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participantsbased on various assumptions in note of the consolidated financial statements sensitivities of the projected benefit obligation pbo and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo as of december associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions were as follows and constitute forward looking statements actuarial assumptionchange in

health care cost trend rate+ also see notes and of the consolidated financial statementscontingencies and litigation the company is subject to proceedings including puc proceedings lawsuits and other claims management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes of these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses including costs of investigation a determination of the amount of reserves required if any for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual case or proceeding often with the assistance of outside counsel the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters such as a change in settlement strategyin general environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense unless it is probable that the puc would allow such costs to be recovered through future rates in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets also environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of property the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for salesee notes and of the consolidated financial statementsincome taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the companys assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes regulations and rules management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience previous actions by taxing authorities eg actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from its tax advisors management believes that the companys provision for tax contingencies is reasonable however the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the companys current and deferred income tax amountssee note of the consolidated financial statementsfollowing are discussions of the electric utility and bank segments additional segment information is shown in note of the consolidated financial statements the discussion concerning hawaiian electric should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and accompanying noteselectric utilityexecutive overview and strategy the utilities provide electricity on all the principal islands in the state other than kauai to approximately of the states population and operate five separate grids the utilities mission is to provide innovative energy leadership for hawaii to meet the needs and expectations of customers and communities and to empower them with affordable reliable and clean energy the goal is to create a modern flexible and dynamic electric grid that enables an optimal mix of distributed energy resources such as private rooftop solar demand response and grid scale resources to enable the creation of smart sustainable resilient communities and achieve the statutory goal of renewable energy by transition to renewable energy the utilities are fully committed to a percent renewable future for hawaii and are partnering with the state of hawaii in achieving its renewable portfolio standard goal of renewable energy by hawaiis rps law requires electric utilities to meet an rps of and by december and respectively the regulatory framework includes a number of mechanisms designed to provide utility financial stability during the transition toward the states renewable energy future under the sales decoupling mechanism the utilities are allowed to recover from customers target test year revenues independent of the level of kwh sales which have declined as privately owned distributed energy resources have been added to the grid and energy efficiency measures have been put into place other regulatory mechanisms reduce regulatory lag such as the major project interim recovery mechanism which allow the utilities to recover and earn on certain approved major capital projects placed into service in between rate cases see item businesshei consolidated and decoupling in note of the consolidated financial statementsthe utilities have made significant progress on the path to clean energy and have been successful in adding significant amounts of renewable energy resources to their electric systems and exceeded the rps goal the utilities rps for was approximately and is on track to achieve the rps goal of see developments in renewable energy efforts below also compared to the utilities have reduced the use of oil to produce electricity by million barrels the combination of replacing fossil fuel generation with renewables customer conservation efforts and energy efficiency actions has allowed the utilities to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of compared to a baseline ahead of schedule in as of the end of the utilities have achieved a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared to power supply improvement plans and integrated grid planning the december psip update report accepted by the puc in july includes the continued growth of private rooftop solar and describes the grid and generation modernization work needed to reliably integrate an estimated total of private systems by and additional grid scale renewable energy resources in addition the plans forecast the addition of mw of grid scale solar and mw of grid scale wind with mw derived from the first phase of the community based renewable energy cbre program the plans also include mw from demand response dr programs which can shift customer use of electricity to times when more renewable energy is available potentially increasing the capacity to add even more renewable resources the december update report emphasizes work that is in progress or planned through on each of the five islands the utilities serveachieving renewable energy will require modernizing the grid through coordinated energy system planning in partnership with local communities and stakeholders to accomplish this the utilities filed its integrated grid planning igp report with the puc on march which provides an innovative systems approach to energy planning intended to yield the most cost effective renewable energy pathways that incorporates customer and stakeholder input the puc opened a docket for the igp process that the utilities had proposed as required the utilities filed an igp work plan on december describing the timing and scope of major activities that will occur in the igp processdemand response programs pursuant to puc orders the utilities are developing an integrated dr portfolio plan that will enhance system operations and reduce costs to customers the reduction in cost for the customer will take the form of either rates or incentive based programs that will compensate customers for their participation individually or by way of engagements with turnkey service providers that contract with the utilities to aggregate and deliver various grid services on behalf of participating customers and their distributed assetsin october the puc approved the utilities request made in december to defer and recover certain computer software and software development costs for a dr management system in an amount not to exceed million exclusive of afudc through the renewable energy infrastructure program surcharge the utilities placed the dr management system in service in the first quarter of in the utilities are expected to sign a number of multi year grid services purchase agreements with third party aggregators these contracts pay service providers to aggregate grid supporting capabilities from customer sited distributed energy resources the first of these five year contracts in a not to exceed amount of million has been executed and is expected to not only deliver benefit through efficient grid operations and avoided fuel costs over that year period but as the puc considers performance based regulation demonstrated savings resulting from these contracts could results in shared savings for the utilities this complements the utilities transformation and supports customer choiceon january the puc approved the utilities revised dr portfolio tariff structure the puc supported the approach of working with aggregators to implement the dr portfolio and ordered the utilities to complete contracting by june and initiate first implementation by the third quarter of the utilities have selected the aggregators and commenced negotiations in july with many technical requirements discussions held throughout the aggregator contracts will be finalized in the first quarter of grid modernization the overall goal of the grid modernization strategy is to deploy modern grid investments at an appropriate priority sequence and pace to cost effectively maximize flexibility minimize the risk of redundancy and obsolescence deliver customer benefits and enable greater der and renewable energy integration under the grid modernization strategy new technology will help triple private rooftop solar and make use of rapidly evolving products including storage and advanced inverters the utilities have begun work to implement the grid modernization strategy by issuing solicitations for advanced meters a meter data management system and a communications network the utilities filed an application with the puc on june for the first implementation phase estimated to cost approximately million and expected to be incurred over five years additional applications will be filed later to implement subsequent phases of the strategycommunity based renewable energy in december the puc adopted a cbre program framework which allows customers who cannot or chose not to take advantage of private rooftop solar to receive the benefits of renewable energy to help offset their monthly electric bills and support clean energy for hawaii the program has two phasesthe first phase which commenced in july totals mw of solar pv only with one credit rate for each island the utilities role is limited to administrative only during the first phase as administrators the utilities will work with subscriber organizations to allocate capacity answer general program questions verify subscriber eligibility and process bill credits for subscribers the utilities are in the process of verifying the projects and awarding the capacity to interested subscriber organizations the response has been positive four of the five islands that the utilities serve have received applications that equal or exceed what is allowed in phase the second phase will commence after review of the first full year of the first phase the second phase is contemplated to be a larger capacity and include multiple credit rates eg time of day and various technologies the utilities will have the opportunity to develop self build projects however of utility capacity will be reserved for low to moderate income customersmicrogrid services tariff proceeding on july the puc issued an order instituting a proceeding to investigate establishment of a microgrid services tariff pursuant to act july act the puc will issue subsequent orders establishing a statement of issues to be addressed in the order and issue a procedural schedule to govern this proceeding

consolidated financial statementsthe effects of the tax act on the utilities regulated operations accrued to the benefit of customers from the effective date of january and were addressed in the utilities rate cases summarized above generally the lower corporate income tax rate lowers the utilities revenue requirements through lower income tax expense and through the amortization of a regulatory liability for excess accumulated deferred income taxes adit resulting from the recording of adit in prior years at the higher income tax rate the revenues collected in the first and a portion of the second quarters of reflected income taxes at the old rate and consequently the utilities reduced revenues to the extent the income taxes collected in revenue exceeded the taxes accrued at the new rate this reduction was recorded to a regulatory liability and electric rates were adjusted in the second quarter to initiate the return of the excess to customers over various amortization periods in addition rates have been adjusted to begin returning the excess adit that was accumulated as of december the tax act also excludes the utilities asset additions from qualifying for bonus depreciation other than certain grandfathered utility property which has the offsetting effect of increasing revenue requirement by lowering adit and thereby increasing rate base on a prospective basis performance based regulation and ratemaking legislation see performance incentive mechanisms and performance based regulation proceeding in note of the consolidated financial statementsdepreciation docket in december the utilities filed an application with the puc for approval of changes in the depreciation and amortization rates and amortization period for ciac based on a

in may a lava eruption occurred within the leilani estates subdivision located along the lower east rift zone of kilauea volcano in the puna district on the island of hawaii and affected approximately of the hawaii electric light customers as of december there was no active flow the flow damaged some of hawaii electric lights property in the affected area and also resulted in the shutdown of independent power producer pgvs facilities hawaii electric light continues to serve the load of hawaii island without capacity from pgv hawaii electric light and pgv are in discussions on the requirements for pgv to return to service however the utilities expect to meet its rps goals without the return of pgv to service the financial impact to hawaii electric light has not been materialliquidity and capital resources as a result of the tax act utility property is no longer eligible for bonus depreciation consequently the initial cash requirement for future capital projects will generally increase approximately because of the loss of the immediate tax benefit from bonus depreciation management believes that hawaiian electrics ability and that of its subsidiaries to

provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows compared to net cash provided by operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in over was impacted by the following higher cash receipts from customers due to increased customer bills as a result of higher rates and higher fuel prices lower cash contributions made to retirement benefit plans in due to the application of the contributions in excess of nppc to reduce the contributions to an amount less than nppc and offset by higher revenue taxes paid due to higher revenues resulting from higher rates and higher fuel prices and higher income taxes paid due to lower deductions recognized in net cash used in investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities in over was primarily driven by increased capital expenditures for construction activities and lower proceeds from contributions in aid of constructionnet cash provided by financing activities the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in over was primarily driven by higher proceeds from issuance of common stock and other bank borrowings partially offset by higher common stock dividends paid in cash flows compared to net cash provided by operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in over was impacted by the following lower cash from an increase in fuel oil stock due to an increase in fuel prices lower cash from an increase in unbilled revenues due to higher fuel prices andlower cash due to refund of federal income taxes in based on bonus depreciation enacted in the fourth quarter of similar treatment was not granted in the fourth quarter of net cash used in investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities in over was driven primarily by an increase in capital expenditures related to construction activities offset by higher contributions in aid of construction and capital goods tax creditnet cash used in financing activities the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in over was driven primarily by lower common stock dividends paid in forecast capital expenditures for the five year period through the utilities forecast up to billion of net capital expenditures which could change over time based upon external factors such as the timing and scope of environmental regulations unforeseen delays in permitting and timing of puc decisions proceeds from the issuance of equity and long term debt cash flows from operating activities temporary increases in short term borrowings and existing cash and cash equivalents are expected to provide the funds needed for the net capital expenditures to pay down commercial paper or other short term borrowings as well as to fund any unanticipated expenditures not included in the to forecast such as increases in the costs or acceleration of capital projects or unanticipated capital expenditures that may be required by new environmental laws and regulationsmanagement periodically reviews capital expenditure estimates and the timing of construction projects these estimates may change significantly as a result of many considerations including changes in economic conditions changes in forecasts of kwh sales and peak load the availability of purchased power and changes in expectations concerning the construction and ownership of future generation units the availability of generating sites and transmission and distribution corridors the need for fuel infrastructure investments the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate increases escalation in construction costs the effects of opposition to proposed construction

note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fuel and power purchase commitmentscompetition although competition in the generation sector in hawaii is moderated by the scarcity of generation sites various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities the puc has promoted a more competitive electric industry environment through its decisions concerning competitive bidding and distributed generation dg an increasing amount of generation is provided by ipps and customer distributed generationcompetitive bidding in december the puc issued a decision that included a final competitive bidding framework which became effective immediately the final framework states among other things that a utility is required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource or a block of generation resources unless the puc finds bidding to be unsuitable the framework does not apply in certain situations identified in the framework waivers from competitive bidding for certain circumstances will be considered the utility is required to select an independent observer from a list approved by the puc whenever the utility or its affiliate seeks to advance a project proposal ie in competition with those offered by bidders the utility may consider its own self bid proposals in response to generation needs identified in its rfp and for any resource to which competitive bidding does not apply due to waiver or exemption the utility retains its traditional obligation to offer to purchase capacity and energy from a qualifying facility qf at avoided cost upon reasonable terms and conditions approved by the puctechnological developments new emerging and breakthrough technological developments eg the commercial development of energy storage grid support utility interactive inverters fuel cells dg grid modernization electrification of transportation and generation from renewable sources may impact the utilities future

baseregulatory assets and liabilities the utilities are regulated by the puc in accordance with accounting standards for regulatory operations the companys and the utilities financial statements reflect assets liabilities revenues and costs of the utilities based on current cost based rate making regulations the actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues expenses assets and liabilitiesregulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred that are refundable to customers regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because their recovery in future customer rates is probable as of december the consolidated regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets of the utilities amounted to million and million respectively compared to million and million as of december respectively regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets are itemized in note of the consolidated financial statements management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return management believes that the recovery of the regulatory assets as of december is probable this determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in hawaii and is subject to change in the futuremanagement believes that the operations of the utilities currently satisfy the criteria for regulatory accounting if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied the utilities expect that their regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys and the utilities results of operations financial condition and liquidityrevenues electric utility revenues are based on rates authorized by the puc and include revenues applicable to estimated energy consumed in the accounting period but not yet billed to customers unbilled revenues and rba revenues or refunds for the difference between puc approved target revenues and recorded adjusted revenues which delinks revenues from kwh sales unbilled revenues represent an estimate of energy consumed by customers subsequent to the date of the last meter reading to the end of the current reporting period as of december unbilled revenues amounted to million and the rba revenues recognized in amounted to millionthe rate schedules of the utilities include ecacs replaced with ecrcs for hawaiian electric and hawaii electric light in under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power the rate schedules of the utilities also include ppacs under which electric rates are more closely aligned with purchase power costs incurred if the ecacecrcs ppacs or rbas were lost or adversely modified it could result in a material adverse effect on the companys and the utilities results of operations financial condition and liquidityconsolidation of variable interest entities a business enterprise must evaluate whether it should consolidate a variable interest entity vie the utilities evaluate the impact of applying accounting standards for consolidation to its relationships with ipps with whom the utilities execute new ppas or execute amendments of existing ppas a possible outcome of the analysis is that hawaiian electric or its subsidiaries may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of a vie which finding may result in the consolidation of the ipp in the consolidated financial statements the consolidation of ipps could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and if such a consolidated ipp were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity the potential recognition of such losses the utilities do not know how the consolidation of ipps would be treated for regulatory or credit ratings purposes see notes and of the consolidated financial statementsbankexecutive overview and strategy asb headquartered in honolulu hawaii is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers asb is one of the largest financial institutions in hawaii and ended with assets of billion and net income of million compared to assets of billion as of december and net income of million in asb provides a wide range of financial products and services and in order to remain competitive and continue building core franchise value asb is focused on deepening customer relationships and developing and introducing new products and services in order to meet market needs additionally the banking industry is constantly changing and asb is making the investments in people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive facilitate process improvements in order to deliver a continuously better experience for its customers and be a more efficient bank asbs continued focus has been on efficient growth to maximize profitability and capital efficiency as well as control expenses key strategies to drive organic growth include deepening customer relationships building out product and service offerings to open new segments fully deploying online and remotely assisted account opening capabilities andprioritizing efficiency actions to gain earnings leverage on organic growththe interest rate environment and the quality of asbs assets will continue to influence its financial results a flattened yield curve as a result of an increase in short term interest rates and excess liquidity in the financial system have made it challenging to grow the banks loan portfolio and find investments with adequate risk adjusted returns the potential for compression of asbs margin when interest rates rise is a risk that is actively managedas part of its interest rate risk management process asb uses simulation analysis to measure net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asb then employs strategies to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income asbs key strategies to manage interest rate risk include attracting and retaining low cost deposits particularly those in non interest bearing transaction accounts diversifying the loan portfolio with higher spread shorter maturity loans and or variable rate loans focusing investment growth in securities that exhibit less extension risk ie risk of longer average lives as rates riseasbs loan quality benefited in from increasing property values more financial flexibility of borrowers and overall general economic

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risklegislation and regulation asb is subject to extensive regulation principally by the occ and the fdic depending on asbs level of regulatory

in july importantly for hei asb hawaii and asb under the dodd frank act all of the functions of the ots transferred on july to the occ the fdic the frb and the consumer financial protection bureau bureau supervision and regulation of hei and asb hawaii as thrift holding companies moved to the frb and supervision and regulation of asb as a federally chartered savings bank moved to the occ while the laws and regulations applicable to hei and asb did not generally change the applicable laws and regulations are being interpreted and new and amended regulations may be adopted by the frb the occ and the bureau in addition hei will continue to be required to serve as a source of strength to asb in the event of its financial distress the dodd frank act also imposed new restrictions on the ability of a savings bank to pay dividends should it fail to remain a qualified thrift lender at all times during asb was a qualified thrift lenderasb may also be subject to new state regulation because of a provision in the dodd frank act that acknowledges that a federal savings bank may be subject to state regulation and allows federal law to preempt a state consumer financial law on a case by case basis only when the state law would have a discriminatory effect on the bank compared to that on a bank chartered in that state the state law prevents or significantly interferes with a banks exercise of its power or the state law is preempted by another federal lawfinal capital rules on july the frb finalized its rule implementing the basel iii regulatory capital framework the final rule would apply to banking organizations of all sizes and types regulated by the frb and the occ except bank holding companies subject to the frbs small bank holding company policy statement and savings loan holding companies slhcs substantially engaged in insurance underwriting or commercial activities hei currently meets the requirements of the exemption as a top tier grandfathered unitary slhc that derived as of june of the previous calendar year either or more of its total consolidated assets or or more of its total revenues on an enterprise wide basis calculated under gaap from activities that are not financial in nature pursuant to section k of the bank holding company act the frb is temporarily excluding these slhcs from the final rule while it considers a proposal relating to capital and other requirements for slhc intermediate holding companies such as asb hawaii the frb indicated that it would release a proposal on intermediate holding companies that would specify the criteria for establishing and transferring activities to intermediate holding companies and propose to apply the frbs capital requirements to such intermediate holding companies the frb has not yet issued such a proposal or a proposal on how to apply the basel iii capital rules to slhcs that are substantially engaged in commercial or insurance underwriting activities such as grandfathered unitary slhcs like heipursuant to the final rule and consistent with the proposals all banking organizations including covered holding companies would initially be subject to the following minimum regulatory capital requirements a common equity tier capital ratio of a tier capital ratio of a total capital ratio of of risk weighted assets and a tier leverage ratio of and these requirements would increase in subsequent years in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers the final rule requires a banking organization to hold a buffer of common equity tier capital above its minimum capital requirements in an amount greater than of total risk weighted assets capital conservation buffer in addition a countercyclical capital buffer would expand the capital conservation buffer by up to of a banking organizations total risk weighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations the final rule would establish qualification criteria for common equity additional tier and tier capital instruments that help to ensure their ability to absorb losses all banking organizations would be required to calculate risk weighted assets under the standardized approach which harmonizes the banking agencies calculation of risk weighted assets and addresses shortcomings in capital requirements identified by the agencies the phased in effective dates of the capital requirements under the final rule are minimum capital requirementseffective dates capital conservation buffer common equity tier ratio + conservation

arrangementsmaterial estimates and critical accounting policies also see material estimates and critical accounting policies for consolidated hei aboveallowance for loan losses see note of the consolidated financial statements and the discussion above under earning assets costing liabilities and other factors asb maintains an allowance for loan losses believed to be adequate to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio the level of allowance for loan losses is based on a continuing assessment of existing risks in the loan portfolio historical loss experience changes in collateral values and current conditions for example economic conditions real estate market conditions and interest rate environment the allowance for loan losses is allocated to loan types using both a formula based approach applied to groups of loans and an analysis of certain individual loans for impairment the formula based approach emphasizes loss factors primarily derived from actual historical default and loss rates which are combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine the allowance amounts allocated to the various loan categories adverse changes in any of these factors could result in higher charge offs and provision for loan lossesasb disaggregates the loan portfolio into loan segments for purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses commercial commercial real estate and commercial construction loans are defined as non homogeneous loans asb utilizes a risk rating system for evaluating the credit quality of such loans loans are rated based on the degree of risk at origination and periodically thereafter as appropriate values are applied separately to the probability of default borrower risk and loss given default transaction risk asb utilizes a numerical based risk rating pd model that takes into consideration fiscal year end financial information of the borrower and identified financial attributes including retained earnings operating cash flows interest coverage liquidity and leverage that demonstrate a strong correlation with default to assign default probabilities at the borrower level in addition a loss given default value is assigned to each loan to measure loss in the event of default based on loan specific features such as collateral that mitigates the amount of loss in the event of default together the pd model and loss given default construct provide a quantitative data driven and consistent framework for measuring risk within the portfolio on a loan by loan basis and for the ultimate collectability of each loanresidential consumer and credit scored business loans are considered homogeneous loans which are typically underwritten based on common uniform standards for the homogeneous portfolio the quality of the loan is best indicated by the repayment performance of an individual borrower asb supplements performance data with external credit bureau data and credit scores such as the fair isaac corporation fico score on a quarterly basis asb has built portfolio loss models for each major segment based on the combination of internal and external data to predict the probability of default at the loan levelasb also considers qualitative factors in determining the allowance for loan losses these include but are not limited to adjustments for changes in policies and procedures in underwriting monitoring or collections economic conditions portfolio mix lending and risk management personnel results of internal audit and quality control reviews collateral values and any concentrations of credit the reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience credit risk grading and historical loss rates this process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as discussed above net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of incomemanagement believes its allowance for loan losses adequately estimates actual loan losses that will ultimately be incurred however such estimates are based on currently available information and historical experience and future adjustments may be required from time to time to the allowance for loan losses based on new information and changes that occur eg due to changes in economic conditions particularly in hawaii actual losses could differ from managements estimates and these differences and subsequent adjustments could be materialfair value fair value estimates are based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid upon the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the fair value estimates are generally determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are based on market data obtained from independent third party sources however in certain cases asb uses its own assumptions based on the best information available in certain circumstances these valuations are estimates at a specific point in time based on relevant market information information about the financial instrument and judgments regarding future expected loss experience economic conditions risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors these estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result if asb were to sell its entire holdings of a particular financial instrument at one time because no active trading market exists for a portion of its financial instruments fair value estimates cannot be determined with precision changes in the underlying assumptions used including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows could significantly affect the estimates in addition the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses could have a significant effect on fair value estimates but have not been considered in making such estimatesasb classifies its financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in accordance with the three level valuation hierarchy level valuations are based on quoted prices unadjusted for identical instruments traded in active markets level valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or model based techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market level valuations are based on model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market or significant management judgment or estimation see fair value measurements in note of the consolidated financial statementssignificant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include asbs mortgage backed securities available for sale these instruments are priced using an external pricing service and are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy the third party pricing services use a variety of methods to determine fair value including quoted prices for similar securities in an active market yield spreads for similar trades adjustments for liquidity size collateral characteristics historic and generic prepayment speeds and other observable market factors to enhance the robustness of the pricing process asb compares its standard third party vendors price with that of another third party vendor if the prices are within an acceptable tolerance range the price of the standard vendor will be accepted if the variance is beyond the tolerance range an evaluation will be conducted by the investment manager and a challenge to the price may be made fair value in such cases will be based on the value that best reflects the data and observable characteristics of the security in all cases the fair value used will have been independently determined by a third party pricing vendor or non affiliated brokerfair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method loan impairments for certain loans real estate acquired in settlement of loans and goodwillsee investment

utilities allowed rates of return interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the companys earnings to adverse movements in interest ratesbank interest rate riskthe companys success is dependent in part upon asbs ability to manage interest rate risk irr asbs interest rate risk profile is strongly influenced by its primary business of making fixed rate residential mortgage loans and taking in retail deposits large mismatches in the amounts or timing between the maturity or repricing of interest sensitive assets or liabilities could adversely affect asbs earnings and the market value of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of significant changes in the level of interest rates many other factors also affect asbs exposure to changes in interest rates such

scenario specific cash flows for all instruments using the specified contractual information for each instrument and product specific prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securitiesnii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asbs twelve month pretax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios nii sensitivity is measured as the change in nii in the alternate interest rate scenarios as a percentage of the base case nii the base case interest rate scenario is established using the current yield curve and assumes interest rates remain constant over the next twelve months the alternate scenarios are created by assuming rate ramps or gradual interest changes and accomplished by moving the yield curve in a parallel fashion over the next twelve month period in increments of + basis points the simulation model forecasts scenario specific principal and interest cash flows for the interest bearing assets and liabilities and the nii is calculated for each scenario key balance sheet modeling assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis include the size of the balance sheet remains relatively constant over the simulation horizon and maturing assets or liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments in order to maintain the current mix of the balance sheet in addition assumptions are made about the prepayment behavior of mortgage backed assets future pricing spreads for new assets and liabilities and the speed and magnitude with which deposit rates change in response to changes in the overall level of interest rates other nii sensitivity analysis may include scenarios such as yield curve twists or non static balance sheet changes such as changes to key balance sheet driversconsistent with occ guidelines the market value or economic capitalization of asb is measured as economic value of equity eve eve represents the theoretical market value of asbs net worth and is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts key assumptions used in the calculation of asbs eve include the prepayment behavior of loans and investments the possible distribution of future interest rates pricing spreads for assets and liabilities in the alternate scenarios and the rate and balance behavior of deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities eve is calculated in multiple scenarios as with the nii simulation the base case is represented by the current yield curve alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of + basis points bp up to + bp the change in eve is measured as the change in eve in a given rate scenario from the base case and expressed as a percentage to gain further insight into the irr profile additional analysis is periodically performed in alternate scenarios including rate shifts of greater magnitude and changes in key balance sheet driversasbs interest rate risk sensitivity measures as of december and constitute forward looking statements and were as follows change in niigradual change in interest rates change in eveinstantaneous change in interest rateschange in interest ratesbasis points december december december december + + + the nii profile under the rising interest rate scenarios was less asset sensitive for all rate increases as of december compared to december nii asset sensitivity has been slowly decreasing as rising rates have slowed prepayment expectations reducing the amount of the fixed rate mortgage and mortgage backed investment portfolios available to reprice in rising rate scenarios in addition the fixed rate portion of the heloc portfolio grew further reducing the amount available to reprice in rising rate scenariosasbs base eve increased to billion as of december compared to billion as of december due to the growth and mix of the balance sheet and longer duration of core deposits growth in the investment and loan portfolios was funded primarily with core depositsin the third quarter of asbs biennial core deposit study was conducted by a third party as part of its regular process as a result of the study the duration of asbs core deposits extended compared to asbs core deposit duration at december this had the effect of improving our base eve and increasing eve sensitivityeve sensitivity shifted from liability to asset sensitive as of december primarily due to core deposit study enhancements leading to a higher retention rate and longer duration the extension of core deposit duration provides greater capacity for hedging long duration assets although market rate increases have been slowing prepayments and extending duration in the residential loan and mortgage backed investment portfolios the longer duration of core deposits mitigates this exposurethe computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the nii sensitivity and the percentage change in eve is based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates loan prepayments balance changes and pricing strategies and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results to the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis actual results may differ materially from the simulation results furthermore nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asbs twelve month pretax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in asbs current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk the simulation does not contemplate any actions that asb management might undertake in response to changes in interest rates further the changes in nii vary in the twelve month simulation period and are not necessarily evenly distributed over the period these analyses are for analytical purposes only and do not represent managements views of future market movements the level of future earnings or the timing of any changes in earnings within the twelve month analysis horizon the actual impact of changes in interest rates on nii will depend on the magnitude and speed with which rates change actual changes in asbs balance sheet and managements responses to the changes in interest ratesother than bank interest rate riskthe companys general policy is to manage other than bank interest rate risk through use of a combination of short term debt long term debt and preferred securities as of december the company was exposed to other than bank interest rate risk because of its periodic borrowing
