item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion relates to the three fiscal years ended july and as disclosed in greater detail elsewhere in this report we commenced mining operations and began to receive operating revenues in august shortly after the end of the fiscal year ended july the financial data in this discussion is in thousands except where otherwise specifically noted we utilize certain non gaap performance measures and ratios in managing the business we believe these measures may provide users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods non gaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in addition the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies use cash costs per ounce sold is a non gaap measure which includes all direct mining costs refining and transportation costs and by product credits as well as royalties as reported in the companys financial statements total cost per ounce sold is a non gaap measure which includes cash costs per ounce sold as well as depreciation and amortization as reported in the companys financial statements overview you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report our financial position was as follows as of as of july july total debt total stockholders equity cash and cash equivalents working capital during our fiscal year ended july our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following net cash provided from operations of capital expenditures of repayments on credit facility of proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercising of warrants of looking forward certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results these include but are not limited to the following the financial data in this discussion is in thousands except for ounces and cash cost data fluctuations in gold prices we expect fiscal gold sales of approximately to ounces cash costs per ounce sold for fiscal are expected to be approximately per ounce we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately in fiscal with approximately being allocated to leach pad expansion approximately for the addition of agglomeration equipment in property interest payments and for additional conveyors repayments on credit facility of during fiscal our fiscal year expectations particularly with respect to sales volumes and cash costs per ounce sold may differ significantly from actual quarter and full fiscal year results due to variations in ore grades and hardness metal recoveries waste removed commodity input prices foreign currencies and gold sale prices result of operations fiscal year ended july compared to the year ended july net income for the year ended july and was approximately and respectively representing an increase of approximately or over the prior period income before taxes was and for the year ended july and respectively which represented an increase of income before taxes increased primarily as a result of higher revenues from a higher gold price being realized on ounces sold during the current period as well as higher production results during the year ended july as compared to the same period a year ago as a result of management changes during the year ended july we incurred severance related charges to executives and employees of approximately within general and administrative expense if we exclude these charges net income for the year ended july would have been approximately representing an increase of approximately or over the prior period revenues costs applicable to sales gold sales for the year ended july totaled approximately as compared to in the prior period representing an increase of approximately or we sold ounces at an average realizable price per ounce of approximately in the current period we sold ounces at an average realizable price per ounce of during the same period last year costs applicable to sales were approximately and respectively for the year ended july and an increase of approximately or cash costs were per ounce of gold sold for the year ended july as compared to for the year ended july the primary reasons for this increase in cash cost per ounce sold in the current period were attributable to an increase in mining costs of approximately or over the prior period this was primarily due to higher mining contractor costs of approximately compared to the prior period primarily due to an increase in tonnage mined of tonnes or higher diesel fuel consumption of due to an increase in tonnage mined and longer haul distance as the pit deepens and higher explosive costs of due to the increase in tonnage mined as well as a change in the type of explosive utilized by the mine higher crushing costs of approximately of an increase of over the prior period mainly due to an increase in maintenance and the usage of crusher parts and supplies this increase was attributable to the addition of our new secondary and tertiary crusher in may and december respectively which increased tonnage going through the circuit by or tonnes as compared to the prior year in addition labor costs rose as a result of the hiring of additional crusher operators an increase in leaching and adr plant costs of approximately or mainly due to an increase in consumption of certain chemicals as well as consumption and price increase in cost of lime in the processing of ore as well as an increase in both water and electricity usage the increased consumption was mainly the result of increasing the chemical concentration and solution flow to the leach pad as we increased the level of lifts or height of the leach pad as well as the surface area under leach with the additional leach pad higher heavy equipment maintenance costs of approximately or over the same period in the prior year this was primarily due to an increase in repair and maintenance costs associated with our three trucks and two loaders the additional tonnage moved in the current year as well as higher repairs and maintenance costs experienced with the procurement of used equipment has factored into the increase as compared to the prior year total costs were per ounce of gold sold for the year ended july as compared to total cost per ounce sold in the prior period the primary reason for this increase in total costs can be attributable to the reasons detailed above as well as the increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from capital expenditures during the current period revenues from by product sales which consist of silver are credited to costs applicable to sales as a by product credit by product sales amounted to and for the year ended july and on silver ounces sold of and respectively depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended july and was approximately and respectively an increase of or the primary reason for the increase in the current period was attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization charges related to property plant and equipment additions general and administration expense general and administrative expenses during the year ended july were approximately an increase of approximately or from the year ended july this increase resulted primarily from one time severance related charges to executives and employees of approximately in addition we experienced higher legal and professional fees associated with merger and acquisition activity including our acquisition with nayarit gold of approximately exploration expense exploration expense during the year ended july and was approximately and respectively or a increase of or both periods presented include activity associated with on going exploration drilling and geochemical work being conducted on our leased and owned concessions located northwest of saric sonora as well as on going drilling at our el chanate mine other income and expense our loss on the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the year ended july and was approximately and respectively and was reflected as other expense the primary reason for the decrease can be attributed to the close out on february with standard bank plc of the remaining ounces of gold hedged under the original gold price protection arrangements originally entered into in march interest expense was approximately for the year ended july compared to approximately for the same period a year earlier this decrease was due to lower interest charges incurred during the current period based on a lower average debt balance compared to the prior period offset by cost of interest rate swaps as of july and there was and respectively outstanding on our term note with standard bank interest expense also includes amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the credit arrangements entered into with standard bank this accounted for approximately and of amortization expense during the year ended july and respectively income tax expense income tax expense was during the fiscal year ended july compared to in with an effective tax rate of and respectively the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate are operating losses generated by the companys us parent for which no benefit has been recognized current year income tax expense and deferred income tax expense amounted to and as of july respectively prior year income tax expense and deferred income tax expense amounted to and as of july respectively mining operations are primarily conducted in mexico mexico has tax laws tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the united states on october the mexican government enacted legislation which introduces certain tax reforms as well as a new minimum flat tax system which was effective for tax year this flat tax system integrates with the regular income tax system and is based on cash basis net income that includes only certain receipts and expenditures the flat tax is set at of cash basis net income for tax year which increased from for tax year if the flat tax is positive it is reduced by the regular income tax and any excess is paid as a supplement to the regular income tax for the tax year the mexican government introduced a reform where if the flat tax is negative companies will not be permitted to reduce the income tax as it may only serve to reduce the regular flat tax payable in that year or can be carried forward for a period of up to ten years to reduce any future flat tax on january the mexican government enacted legislation which increases the regular income tax rate from to the regular income tax rate will decrease to in and then back to in according to legislation companies are required to prepay income taxes on a monthly basis based on the greater of the flat tax or regular income tax as calculated for each monthly period there is the possibility of implementation amendments by the mexican government and the estimated future income tax liability recorded at the balance sheet date may change deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse in accordance with asc guidance for income taxes the measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits which are on a more likely than not basis not expected to be realized net deferred tax assets related to the us operations have been fully reserved the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods

ounces produced sold gold produced each year does not necessarily correspond to gold sold during the year as there is a time delay in the actual sale of the gold fiscal year ended july compared to fiscal year ended july net income for the years ended july and was approximately and respectively representing an increase of approximately over the prior period net income before income taxes was and for the years ended july and respectively which represented an increase of net income and net income before taxes increased primarily as a result of higher revenues from more ounces of gold being sold during the year ended july as compared to the same period a year ago income tax expense increased in conjunction with the increase in net income before tax which was anticipated revenues costs applicable to sales gold sales for the fiscal year ended july totaled approximately as compared to in the prior period representing an increase of approximately or we sold ounces at an average realizable price per ounce of approximately in the current period we sold ounces at an average realizable price per ounce of during the same period last year costs applicable to sales were approximately and respectively for the year ended july and an increase of approximately or which increased in conjunction with our increase in revenues cash costs of per ounce of gold sold for the year ended july was lower than the for the year ended july the primary reason for this decrease in cash costs in the current year can be attributed to the net profit interest paid to royal gold which was primarily incurred in the prior fiscal year this was offset by a higher waste to ore strip ratio of to experienced during the fiscal year ended july as compared to the prior fiscal year of to our increased production profile in the current fiscal year advanced the removal of more waste tonnes than in the prior year total costs of per ounce of gold sold for the year ended july was lower than the total cost in the prior period the primary reason for this decrease in total costs was attributed to higher amortization charges recorded in the prior period related to the repurchase of the net profit interest acquired from fg in for revenues from by product sales which consist of silver are credited to costs applicable to sales as a by product credit by product sales amounted to and for the year ended july and on silver ounces sold of and respectively depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended july and was approximately and respectively the primary reason for the decrease of approximately or was due to amortization charges recorded in the prior period related to the repurchase of the net profit interest acquired from fg in for the was fully amortized during the quarterly period ended april this was slightly offset by an increase in units of production depreciation and amortization mainly attributable to additional ounces being produced in the current period versus the same period in the prior year general and administration expense general and administrative expenses during the year ended july were approximately a decrease of approximately or from the year ended july the decrease in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from lower salaries and wages primarily due to a decrease in cash bonuses of approximately during the current fiscal year compared to the prior year lower equity based compensation of approximately as compared to the prior year lower investor relations and travel expenses of approximately offsetting these decreases were higher legal and financial advisor fees incurred as a result of merger and acquisition activity during the current year as well as higher audit fees associated with the attestation report issued on the effectiveness of our internal controls during the current period exploration expense exploration expense during the year ended july and was approximately and respectively or an increase of or the primary reason for the increase can be attributed to increased activity during the current period associated with on going exploration drilling and geochemical work being conducted on our leased and owned concessions located northwest of saric sonora exploration expense for the current period also included costs incurred from a hole deep core drilling campaign at our el chanate mine totaling meters exploration expense in the prior period included a drilling campaign initiated in december at el chanate which consisted of reverse circulation holes amounting to meters these drill holes were mainly positioned to test the outer limits of the currently known ore zones within the pit other income and expense our loss on the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the year ended july and was approximately and respectively and was reflected as other expense the primary reason for the increase can be attributed to the settlement on february with standard bank plc the remaining ounces of gold under the original gold price protection arrangements entered into in march the purpose of these arrangements at the time was to protect us in the event the gold price dropped below per ounce total remuneration to unwind these arrangements was approximately in conjunction with the settlement of the gold price protection agreements we incurred an other expense of approximately during the current period these contracts were not designated as hedging derivatives and therefore special hedge accounting does not apply interest expense was approximately for the year ended july compared to approximately for the same period a year earlier this decrease was mainly due to lower interest charges incurred during the current period related to our credit arrangements with standard bank as of july there was outstanding on our term note interest expense also includes deferred financing costs resulting from the credit arrangements entered into with standard bank this accounted for approximately and of depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended july and income tax expense income tax expense was

in accrued expenses of mainly due to the accruals associated with one time severance related charges to executives and employees as well as an increase in our income tax accrual during the year ended july in addition on january we entered into a collateral agreement the collateral agreement with metal recovery solutions llc mrs a privately held nevada company in which it was proposed that we would acquire twenty five percent of all of the issued and outstanding equity of mrs for aggregate investment of the collateral agreement required us to promptly pay to mrs with the intention to invest the remaining set forth in a letter of intent the loi entered into on january the material terms of which were non binding our obligation to invest the remaining was contingent upon the execution of a definitive investment agreement the investment agreement because the investment agreement was not consummated the collateral agreement provides that the payment to mrs would be repaid with interest the mrs repayment such repayment is secured by cash flows from mrss consulting services agreement with a third party gold mining company the expected value of which is to mrs on march we elected not

the parties agreed to reduce the mrs repayment to and we are currently receiving repayment based on the original collateral agreement we recorded the remaining receivable amount of as of july as an other current asset investing activities cash used in investing activities during the year ended july amounted to approximately primarily for the acquisition of an additional tertiary crusher and screen plant additional water rights additional leach pad expansion as well as new platform upgrades for three of our crushers in may we initiated the planning and permitting on the construction of an additional leach pad to the east of the existing leach pads the total capacity of this additional leach pad will be approximately million tonnes when stacked to six lifts and cost approximately this pad will be expanded on the south east and possibly west sides to accommodate the current ore reserve when combined with the original and west pads the aggregate capacity will be approximately million tonnes this capital expenditure is anticipated to be expended over the next twelve months site clearing was initiated in may and construction commenced in july the first panel is anticipated to be ready for stacking towards the end of the calendar year with complete construction anticipated to be completed by may in july the company commenced the use of belt agglomeration with cement which is added to the crushed ore at the el chanate mine to improve the flow of leaching solution we have engaged an independent consultant with respect to heap leaching optimization which has resulted in recommendations to increase the barren solution flow to the leach pad increase the pregnant solution flow to the recovery plant and redirect the low grade solution to the leach pads when implemented these operational changes combined with the agglomeration with cement and barren solution may result in immediate improvements in leaching time we ordered two agglomeration drums which are expected to arrive by january the current belt agglomeration is a temporary measure until the drums are delivered the use of agglomeration drums will allow for better mixing of cement and lime with the crushed ore producing a consistent quality control of the product the cost of these agglomeration drums and an additional overland conveyor is anticipated to be cash used in investing activities during the year ended july amounted to approximately primarily from the acquisition of an additional secondary crusher and tunnel conveyor mobile equipment conveyors and adr plant equipment including the carbon regeneration kiln financing activities cash used in financing activities during the year ended july amounted to approximately primarily from the repayment of our term loan of we also received proceeds of approximately in the current period from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and warrants in addition we paid in finance costs to amend our amended and restated credit agreement with standard bank see term loan and revolving credit facility section below cash used in financing activities during the year ended july amounted to approximately primarily from the repayment of the term loan of business combination agreements on october the company and gammon gold inc gammon gold entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which gammon gold offered to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of capital gold in a cash and share transaction the gammon transaction the total consideration for the purchase of of the fully diluted shares of capital gold is approximately us million or us per capital gold share based on gammon golds closing price on september on the nyse the gammon transaction has the unanimous support of both companies boards of directors and officers under the terms of the gammon transaction each common share of capital gold will be exchanged for common shares of gammon gold and a cash payment in the amount of us per share based on the september closing price of capital golds shares on the nyse euronext the acquisition price represents a premium to the close on september th and a premium to the day volume weighted average price on the nyse euronext ending on that date the consummation of the gammon transaction is subject to numerous contingencies as described in the related merger agreement including but not limited to capital gold stockholder approval on august the company acquired nayarit gold inc nayarit as a result of the business combination nayarit became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company in connection with the business combination each outstanding share of nayarit common stock was converted into shares of capital gold common stock with cash paid in lieu of any fractional share capital gold issued shares of its common stock in the business combination to nayarits current stockholders and has reserved for issuance an additional and shares of capital gold common stock upon the exercise of former nayarit warrants and options respectively based on the number of outstanding shares of nayarit common stock and capital gold common stock after the consummation of the business combination the stockholders of nayarit own approximately of capital gold on a non diluted basis based on the closing price of the companys common stock on august the consideration received by nayarit shareholders had a value of approximately million as detailed below conversion calculation estimated fair value form of consideration in thousands except per share amounts number of nayarit shares outstanding as of the amalgamation date exchange ratio number of shares issued to nayarit shareholders value of capital gold common shares issued capital gold common stock value of nayarits options and warrants to be exchanged for capital gold options and warrants capital gold options and warrants total consideration transferred in accordance with asc the fair value of equity securities issued as part of the consideration transferred was the closing market price of capital golds common stock on the effective date of the amalgamation the pro forma shares issued was common shares which is calculated by multiplying by being the number of shares of nayarit common stock outstanding on august nayarit shareholders own approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of capital gold common stock represents the fair value to acquire and shares of capital gold common stock upon the exercise of former nayarit warrants and options respectively the fair value of the warrants and options were estimated using the black scholes valuation model utilizing the assumptions noted below stock price post conversion strike price average expected volatility dividend yield none average risk free interest rate average contractual term years black scholes average value per warrant and option the expected volatility of capital golds stock price is based on the average historical volatility which is based on daily observations and duration consistent with the expected life assumption and implied volatility the average contractual term of the warrants and options is based on the remaining contractual exercise term of each warrant and option the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury securities with maturities equal to the expected life of the warrants and options the transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of major assets acquired and liabilities assumed on august fair valuein thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments prepaid expenses and sundry receivables property plant and equipment mineral interests indicated and inferred exploration interests accounts payable and liabilities assumed net assets acquired a single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions the companys judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact the companys results from operations the companys management allocated the acquisition cost to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of nayarits tangible and identifiable assets and liabilities the amount allocated to the mineral and exploration interests was based on a valuation report prepared by a third party appraisal firm the allocation is not considered final as of the date of this report as management is still reviewing certain of the underlying assumptions and calculations used in the allocation to the assets and liabilities of nayarit that were acquired however the company believes the final purchase price allocation will not be materially different than presented herein during the twelve months ended july the company incurred transaction costs consisting primarily of legal professional investment advisory and accounting fees of million these costs are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations pro forma information the following unaudited pro forma results of operations of the company for the fiscal years ended july and assume that the acquisition of the operating assets of the significant businesses acquired during

issues management does not expect that environmental issues will have an adverse material effect on our liquidity or earnings the company complies with all laws rules and regulations concerning mining environmental health zoning and historical preservation issues and we are not aware of any environmental issues or reclamation issues at the el chanate concessions we have received the required mexican government permits for operations any revisions to our mine plan may require us to amend the permits we received the annual extension to the explosive use permit from the relevant authorities the permit is valid through december we include environmental and reclamation costs on an ongoing basis in our revenue and cost projections no assurance can be given that environmental regulations will not be revised by the mexican authorities in the future as of july we have estimated the reclamation costs for the el chanate site to be approximately if we had to reclaim the property as of that date reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and closure costs the asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance and activity to date will occur we review on an annual basis unless otherwise deemed necessary the asset retirement obligation for the mine site we reviewed the estimated present value of the el chanate mine reclamation and closure costs as of july primarily due to the addition of the new leach pad in accordance with asc guidance for asset retirement and environmental obligations as of july our reclamation and remediation liability was contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of july are summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt remediation and reclamation obligations operating leases derivative instruments amounts represent principal and estimated interest payments assuming no early extinguishment mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate pursuant to environmental regulations we are required to close our

encounter unexpected problems we may need to raise additional capital we also may need to raise additional capital for significant property acquisitions and or exploration activities to the extent that we need to obtain additional capital management may raise such funds through the sale of our securities obtain debt financing and or joint venturing with one or more strategic partners we cannot

accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include inventory revenue recognition property plant and mine development impairment of long lived assets accounting for equity based compensation environmental remediation costs accounting for derivative and hedging activities income taxes and use of estimates ore on leach pads and inventories in process inventory costs that are incurred in or benefit the productive process are accumulated as ore on leach pads and inventories ore on leach pads and inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market the current portion of ore on leach pads and inventories is determined based on the amounts to be processed within the next months the major classifications are as follows ore on leach pads the recovery of gold from ore is achieved through the heap leaching process under this method ore is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical solution which dissolves the gold contained in the ore the resulting pregnant solution is further processed in a processing plant that extracts gold from this solution producing gold dore costs are applied to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs including applicable depreciation depletion and amortization relating to the mining operation costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad the estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads measured tonnes added to the leach pads the grade of ore placed on the leach pads based on fire assay data and a recovery percentage based on ore type and column testwork it is estimated that the companys leach pad at el chanate will recover all ounces placed within a one year period from date of placement although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered metallurgical balancing the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels as a result the metallurgical balancing process needs to be constantly monitored and estimates need to be refined based on actual results over time the companys operating results may be impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads in process inventory in process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product conversion processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the specific processing facility but include leach in circuit flotation and column cells and carbon in pulp inventories in process material are measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of the respective plants in process inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines and or leach pads plus the in process conversion costs including applicable depreciation relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process precious metals inventory precious metals inventories include gold dor and or gold bullion precious metals that result from the companys mining and processing activities are valued at the average cost of the respective in process inventories incurred prior to the refining process plus applicable refining costs materials and supplies materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes applicable taxes and freight property plant and mine development expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated productive lives which do not exceed the related estimated mine lives of such facilities based on proven and probable reserves mineral exploration costs are expensed as incurred when it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves costs incurred prospectively to develop the property will be capitalized as incurred and are amortized using the units of production uop method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves impairment of long lived assets we review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable an impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets including goodwill if any an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of recoverable minerals expected gold and other commodity prices considering current and historical prices price trends and related factors production levels and operating costs of production and capital all based on life of mine plans existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured indicated or inferred resource base are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and subsequently in determining whether the assets are impaired the term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on managements relative confidence in such materials in estimating future cash flows assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups our estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals gold and other commodity prices production levels and operating costs of production and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties reclamation and remediation costs asset retirement obligations reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and closure costs the asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance and activity to date will occur we review on an annual basis unless otherwise deemed necessary the asset retirement obligation at our mine site in accordance with asc guidance for asset retirement and environmental obligations deferred financing costs deferred financing costs which were included in other assets relate to costs incurred in connection with bank borrowings and are amortized over the term of the related borrowings intangible assets purchased intangible assets consisting of rights of way easements net profit interests etc are carried at cost less accumulated amortization amortization is computed using the straight line method over the economic lives of the respective assets generally five years or using the units of production method it is our policy to assess periodically the carrying amount of our purchased intangible assets to determine if there has been an impairment to their carrying value impairments of intangible assets are determined in accordance with asc guidance for intangibles there was no impairment at july fair value of financial instruments the carrying value of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents marketable securities loans receivable accrued expenses and accounts payable approximated fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments the carrying amount of the companys accounts receivable balance approximates fair value the carrying value of the companys long term debt approximates fair value due to the variable nature of its interest rate revenue recognition revenue is recognized from the sale of gold dor when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is determinable the product has been shipped to the refinery the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured from the customer the company sells its precious metal content to a financial institution revenues are determined by selling the precious metal content at the spot price sales are calculated based upon assay of the dors precious metal content and its weight the company sells approximately of the precious metal content contained within the dor from the refinery based upon the preliminary assay of the company the residual ounces are sold upon obtaining the final assay and settlement for the shipment the company forwards an irrevocable transfer letter to the refinery to authorize the transfer of the precious metal content to the customer the sale is recorded by the company upon the refinery pledging the precious metal content to the customer the company waits until the dor precious metal content is pledged to the customer at the refinery to recognize the sale because collectability is not ensured until the dor precious metal content is pledged the sale price is not subject to change subsequent to the initial revenue recognition date revenues from by product sales which consist of silver are credited to costs applicable to sales as a by product credit by product sales amounted to and for the years ended july and on silver ounces sold of and respectively foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of the companys mexican subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities amounts on the statement of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the year gains or losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included as a component of other comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss which is reported on the accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss consists of accumulated foreign translation gains and losses the fair value change in our interest rate swap agreement and net unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities income taxes on october the mexican government enacted legislation which introduces certain tax reforms as well as a new minimum flat tax system which was effective for tax year this new flat tax system integrates with the regular income tax system and is based on cash basis net income that includes only certain receipts and expenditures the flat tax is set at of cash basis net income for tax year which increased from for tax year if the flat tax is positive it is reduced by the regular income tax and any excess is paid as a supplement to the regular income tax for the tax year the mexican government introduced a reform where if the flat tax is negative companies will not be permitted to reduce the income tax as it may only serve to reduce the regular flat tax payable in that year or can be carried forward for a period of up to ten years to reduce any future flat tax on january the mexican government enacted legislation which increases the regular income tax rate from to the regular income tax rate will decrease to in and then back to in according to legislation companies are required to prepay income taxes on a monthly basis based on the greater of the flat tax or regular income tax as calculated for each monthly period this legislation remains subject to ongoing varying interpretations there is the possibility of implementation amendments by the mexican government and the estimated future income tax liability recorded at the balance sheet date may change deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse in accordance with asc guidance for income taxes the measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits which are on a more likely than not basis not expected to be realized the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted equity based compensation in connection with offers of employment to our executives as well as in consideration for agreements with certain consultants we issue options and warrants to acquire our common stock employee and non employee awards are made in the discretion of the board of directors we account for stock compensation under asc guidance for compensation stock compensation which requires the company to expense the cost of employees services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award this expense must be recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant accounting for derivatives and hedging activities on october prior to our initial draw on the credit agreement we entered into interest rate swap agreements in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement which requires that we hedge at least of our outstanding debt under this agreement the agreements entered into cover or of the outstanding debt both swaps covered this same notional amount of but over different time horizons the first covered the six months that commenced on october and terminated on march and the second covers the period from march through december we intend to use discretion in managing this risk as market conditions vary over time allowing for the possibility of adjusting the degree of hedge coverage as we deem appropriate however any use of interest rate derivatives will be restricted to use for risk management purposes we used variable rate debt to finance a portion of the el chanate project variable rate debt obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates as a result of these arrangements we will continuously monitor changes in interest rate exposures and evaluate hedging opportunities our risk management policy permits us to use any combination of interest rate swaps futures options caps and similar instruments for the purpose of fixing interest rates on all or a portion of variable rate debt establishing caps or maximum effective interest rates or otherwise constraining interest expenses to minimize the variability of these effects the interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges whereby effective hedge gains or losses are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and later reclassified to the interest expense component of earnings coincidently with the earnings impact of the interest expenses being hedged ineffective hedge results are immediately recorded in earnings also under interest expense no component of hedge results is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness we are exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to these interest rate swap agreements but we do not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations to manage credit risks we select counterparties based on credit ratings limit our exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines and monitor the market position with each counterparty as required by asc guidance for derivatives and hedging use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk metal price changes in the market price of gold significantly affects our profitability and cash flow gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors such as demand forward selling by producers central bank sales purchases and lending investor sentiment the relative strength of the us dollar and global mine production levels foreign currency changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors such as supply and demand for foreign and us currencies and us and foreign country economic conditions most of our assets and operations are in mexico therefore we are more susceptible to fluctuations in the mexican peso us dollar exchange our mexico operations sell their metal production based on a us dollar gold price as is the general world wide convention fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar can increase or decrease profit margins to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves however if a sustained weakening of the us dollar in relation to the mexican peso that impacts our cost structure was not mitigated by offsetting increases in the us dollar gold price or by other factors then profitability cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced the extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the us dollar and managements long term view of the applicable exchange rate we believe however that this exchange rate variability has not had a material impact on our financial statements gold price protection agreement on february we settled with standard bank the remaining ounces of gold under the original gold price protection arrangements entered into in march the purpose of these arrangements at the time was to protect the company in the event the gold price dropped below per ounce total remuneration to unwind these arrangements was approximately interest rate swap contracts on october prior to our initial draw on the credit agreement we entered into interest rate swap agreements in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement although the credit facility requires that we hedge at least of our outstanding debt under this facility we elected to cover or of the outstanding debt the termination date on our existing swap position is december however we intend to use discretion in managing this risk as market conditions vary over time allowing for the possibility of adjusting the degree of hedge coverage as we deem appropriate in any case our use of interest rate derivatives will be restricted to use for risk management purposes market risk disclosures july in thousands instruments entered into for hedging purposes type of derivative notional size fixed price or strike price underlying price termination or expiration fair value interest rate swaps mo usd libor the value shown reflects the notional as of july over the term of the swap the notional amortizes dropping to approximately as of july the dollar value of a basis point for this interest rate swap was approximately suggesting that a one basis point rise fall of the yield curve would likely foster an increase decrease in the interest rate swaps value by approximately because hedge accounting is applied the contract serves to lock in a fixed rate of interest for the portion of the variable rate debt equal to the swaps notional size the swap covers only of our variable rate exposure
