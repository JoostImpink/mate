critical accounting estimates the companys summary of significant accounting policies is provided in item the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires hercules to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities hercules evaluates its estimates on a regular basis including those related to impairments of goodwill intangible and other long lived assets income taxes contingencies including those related to litigation environmental issues asset retirement obligations asbestos lawsuits and claims pension and other benefit obligations and stock based compensation hercules bases its estimates on various factors including historical experience consultation and advice from third party subject matter experts and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management reviews significant estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions hercules believes that the following accounting estimates are critical due to the significant subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on its consolidated financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets the company performs an annual assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment in addition the company consistently considers factors including deterioration in future economic conditions poor operating results in the reporting units new or stronger competitors or changes in technology that could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets thereby requiring an impairment in the future to assess impairment the company compares its reporting units book values of net assets including goodwill to its fair value fair value is estimated using a combination of valuation approaches including the market value and income approaches income valuation methodologies are based on estimates of future cash flows discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate of return discount rate that essentially represents the companys cost of capital the key assumptions considered in the development of estimates of future cash flows include revenue growth including price and volume cost of sales growth including raw materials prices and labor and benefit costs indirect corporate overhead working capital and capital expenditures commensurate with the sales and cost growth rates and the discount rate the estimate of future cash flows inherently involves significant management judgment as it represents a forecast of future events in addition the discount rate is also subject to change from year to year based on the relative balance of the companys outstanding debt and equity actual rates of interest on outstanding debt and the companys stock price the following table summarizes the approximate average impact of a change in the most significant of these assumptions on the fair value of the companys net assets while all other assumptions are held constant change average impact discount rate + + million revenue growth + + million cost of sales growth + + million the company has identified its two active operating segments ptv and aqualon as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangible assets as well as the assessment for impairment goodwill and intangible assets have been allocated to the reporting units as a result of prior transactions in which these individual reporting units acquired net assets or otherwise expanded their ownership interests in other related businesses the underlying assets related to such transactions including goodwill and intangible assets have been and continue to be fully integrated into the operations of the reporting units other long lived assets the company tests other long lived assets including property plant and equipment for impairment based on an assessment of factors including deterioration in future economic conditions poor operating results in a business the determination that the long lived asset is unsuitable for one reason or another new or stronger competitors or changes in technology that could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset thereby requiring an impairment in the future in some cases the underlying assessment is subjective in nature and represents a significant degree of judgment deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized after consideration of future taxable income and reasonable tax planning strategies in the event that hercules were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had not been established or is able to utilize capital and or operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been established an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be reflected in income in the period such determination is made table of contents asset retirement obligations and environmental contingencies the company establishes reserves for environmental matters and asset retirement obligations when a legal obligation exists and the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition the company recognizes a loss for environmental related litigation and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the actual costs will depend upon numerous factors including the estimated useful life of the companys manufacturing facilities and significant component assets changes in the nature or use of existing assets and facilities the number of parties found responsible at each environmental site and their ability to pay the actual methods of remediation required or agreed to outcomes of negotiations with regulatory authorities outcomes of litigation changes in the timing of required remedial activities changes in the discount rates used to determine the fair value of obligations changes in environmental laws and regulations technological developments the years of remedial activity required and changes in the number or financial exposures of claims lawsuits settlements or judgments or in the ability to reduce such financial exposures by collecting indemnity payments from insurers or others each factor is considered sensitive to variation which could impact estimates of the timing and amount of cash flows asbestos related contingencies the company has established reserves for asbestos related personal injury lawsuits and claims based upon the results of an annual actuarial study of its asbestos related liabilities by a recognized expert at a major national university this study is based on a number of assumptions including the anticipated number of future claims the timing and amount of future payments disease venue and the dynamic nature of asbestos litigation and other circumstances while the expert noted above has applied his methodology in determining the companys reasonably possible range of exposures for these liabilities on a consistent basis other methods in practice exist which place a differing degree of emphasis on the underlying variables used to measure asbestos related contingencies such other methods could yield significantly different ranges of reasonably possible exposures pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefits costs are determined based upon actuarial assumptions regarding mortality medical cost inflation rates discount rates long term return on assets salary increases medicare availability and other factors changes in these assumptions can result in changes to the recognized pension and other postretirement benefits expense and recorded liabilities the assets and liabilities associated with the companys defined benefit pension plans are subject to interest rate and market risk a basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate has an unfavorable or favorable impact of approximately million on the us defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation which should be offset to a large extent by a commensurate movement in plan assets see note to the consolidated financial statements stock based compensation for financial reporting purposes the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options issued as compensation to key employees and non employee directors the model determines a fair value based on a number of key variables including the grant date price of hercules common stock and the related exercise or strike price estimated dividend yield estimated term of the option prior to exercise risk free rate of interest over the estimated term and a measure of the volatility of hercules common stock over the estimated term certain of these variables encompass a degree of subjectivity whose variability could result in significantly different values for the grant date fair value of stock option awards in addition the company recognizes share based compensation cost based upon the number of awards that are expected to vest this measure implicitly includes an estimate for forfeitures based on employee turnover reductions in force and other factors specific to the award recipient population the company has a policy to review its estimate of award forfeitures on an annual basis or when specific facts and circumstances warrant additional review the review is primarily based on historical experience and provides for estimated rates applicable to company officers and all other employees respectively prior to the company had estimated different rates for these two employee groups based on its most recent annual review actual experience rates and other factors have resulted in the convergence of the estimated forfeiture rates for the two employee groups however future reviews will continue to assess the groups independently the change in estimated forfeiture rates will result in total share based compensation cost that is lower by less than million than that which would have been recorded had the change in estimate not occurred for table of contents results of operations consolidated review a comparative analysis by line item of the statement of operations is provided as follows for the years ended december and change change net sales net sales for increased approximately from primarily as a result of million or higher volume million or attributable to higher pricing and million or due to

fixed cost absorption primarily attributable to aqualon as production continued at or near capacity for a number of high demand products raw material cost increases over levels were million price increases recovered a substantial portion of these cost increases however the terms of certain annual contracts limited the recovery during the latter part of contract renewals implemented for as well as recently announced price increases for certain products linked to those raw materials that have greater price volatility are expected to provide for substantial cost recovery throughout in addition to pricing and contract initiatives the company continues to implement actions to mitigate raw material cost increases including pursuing product substitutions improving yields and efficiencies and implementing energy conservation programs cost of sales decreased during as compared to primarily reflecting the absence of fibervisions costs subsequent to march excluding the effect of fibervisions overall costs for raw materials and energy were higher during as compared to price increases and surcharges recovered a substantial portion but not all of the related cost increases in addition improved fixed cost absorption primarily attributable to aqualon as production was at capacity for a number of high demand products as well as lower transportation expenses partially offset the higher costs on an aggregate basis raw material and energy costs increased million over levels while the rate of increase in costs moderated the overall trend of increasing costs continued from the second

a similar strategy was implemented for the companys uk pension plan during the first quarter of the strategy for the us qualified plan has been effectuated through a shift to a fixed income portfolio with a duration to approximate that of the benefit obligations while reducing the plans exposure to equity and other investment securities to of total assets this strategy is expected to substantially
