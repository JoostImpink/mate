and complementary services such as integration training and maintenance utilizing our global integration and development centers to date sales of standalone software products and services have not exceeded of our consolidated revenues for any period we sell our products worldwide through our alliances with ibm lenovo nec and clearcube and other indirect channels such as distributors resellers and systems integrators and to a lesser extent through direct sales our customers including those we serve through our alliance and distribution partners include autozone cvs daimler chrysler france telecom lockheed martin royal bank of canada and the va medical centers our international sales are primarily made through distributors and are collectible primarily in us dollars while the associated operating expenses are payable in foreign currencies in addition to our principal headquarters in the united states we maintain offices in the united kingdom germany france austria china and australia net revenues from sales outside of the united states primarily in europe the middle east and africa emea based on the location of our customers were as follows year ended june international net revenues percentage change over prior period percentage of net revenue table of contents strategy the market for thin client devices is part of the enterprise personal computer pc market we market our thin client devices as alternatives to pcs in certain target markets our strategies are to focus on selling thin client software and device products that compete effectively with pcs increasing sales to small medium and large enterprise customers through our relationships with ibm lenovo and other resellers as well as directly to end users we have been executing marketing initiatives designed to grow the thin client segment of the pc industry we utilize third parties that we believe have strong market positions in the server based computing market to expand our sales and marketing efforts which allows us to develop new customer relationships as well as gain access to new markets acquisitions in november we completed the acquisition pursuant to a merger of maxspeed corporation a provider of thin client solutions headquartered in palo alto california with research development and sales offices in shanghai china in october we acquired the thin client business of televideo inc including a trademark license product brands customer lists customer contracts and non competition agreements in april we acquired all of the outstanding shares of qualystem technology sas a provider

software solutions as a result of the mangrove acquisition we acquired customer lists intellectual property and technology and non compete agreements in september we acquired the thin client business of visara including customer lists intellectual property and technology and also entered into reseller supplier and non competition agreements our acquisition strategy is to integrate acquired businesses into our core business to generate increased revenues as well as synergies for the company as a whole this generally involves transitioning channel partners and end customers to our core products and utilizing acquired development and sales resources to support our core development sales and marketing activities accordingly we do not have the ability to accurately report revenue from our acquired businesses financial highlights net revenue gross profit margin and earnings per share are key measurements of our financial results for fiscal net revenue was million a decline of from fiscal gross profit margin was for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the revenue decrease was the result of decreased sales primarily to several large enterprise customers in the us the gross profit margin percentage decrease was primarily the result of competitive pricing resulting in reduced average selling prices asp an increasing mix of xpe based product which carries a lower gross profit margin lower revenue from direct software sales and higher overhead expenses diluted loss per share was for fiscal compared to a net income of in fiscal as a result of decreased gross profit from lower revenue and lower gross profit margins increased operating expenses increased stock based compensation and increased cost of amortization of acquired intangibles stock based compensation expense included in these results was in cost of products sold and million in operating expense for fiscal and amortization of intangibles was million in cost of products sold and million for fiscal table of contents our fiscal results were also affected by approximately million of severance costs included in operating expenses associated with senior management turnover and of abandoned acquisition costs for an acquisition that did not close for fiscal net revenue was million an increase of from fiscal gross profit margin was for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the revenue increase was the result of increased sales of our products primarily to large enterprise customers the gross profit margin percentage decrease was primarily the result of significant sales of the neoware e thin client product in fiscal the neoware e has higher average selling prices higher gross profit dollars per unit sold and lower percentage gross margins than other neoware thin client devices diluted earnings per share decreased to for fiscal compared to in fiscal as a result of increased gross profit from revenue growth offset by stock based compensation expense increased operating expenses and increased cost of amortization of acquired intangibles as well as a larger number of fully diluted shares due to a stock offering completed in february stock based compensation expense included in these results was in cost of products sold and million in operating expense for fiscal and amortization of intangibles was million and million for fiscal and respectively our fiscal results were also adversely affected by the significant financial difficulties of one of our german distributors which caused us to reserve revenue of invoiced in the fourth quarter of fiscal and to add to our reserve for doubtful accounts as of june our cash cash equivalents and short term investments were million compared to million at june during fiscal we generated million of cash from operations received million from the settlement of escrow matters related to the maxspeed acquisition and received million of cash from the exercise of stock options and related excess tax benefits critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve managements judgments and estimates these critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill accounting for income taxes stock based compensation these policies and estimates and our procedures related to these policies and estimates are described in detail below and under specific areas within the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations please refer to note organization and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and estimates our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates and management discussion and analysis with its audit committee revenue recognition for each type of arrangement we make judgments regarding the fair value of multiple elements contained in our arrangements whether fees are fixed or determinable whether collectibility is probable and the accounting for potential distributor stock rotation rights and price protection these judgments and their effect on revenue recognition are discussed below multiple element arrangements net revenues include sales of thin client devices which include the device and related software maintenance and technical support as well as standalone software products and services we follow aicpa statement of position no software revenue recognition sop for revenue recognition revenue is recognized on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable table of contents beginning in march changes were introduced to our post contract support services whereby the cost to provide these services are not expected to be insignificant and unspecified upgrades and enhancements are expected to be more than minimal and infrequent as a result in march we began to defer revenue related to these services from sales of our products which include one year of post contract support services prior to march revenue related to post contract support services was generally recognized with the initial product sale when the fee was included with the initial product fee post contract services were for one year or less the estimated cost of providing such services during the arrangement was insignificant and unspecified upgrades and enhancements offered during the period were expected to continue to be minimal and infrequent revenue from extended warranty and stand alone post contract support service contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized over the term of the contract vendor specific objective evidence of these amounts is determined by the price charged when these elements are sold separately the fee is fixed or determinable we make judgments at the outset of an arrangement regarding whether the fees are fixed or determinable the majority of our payment terms are within to days after invoice date we review arrangements that have payment terms extending beyond days on a case by case basis to determine if the fee is fixed or determinable if we determine at the outset of an arrangement that the fees are not fixed or determinable we recognize revenue as the fees become due and payable collection is probable we make judgments at the outset of an arrangement regarding whether collection is probable probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis we typically sell to customers with whom we have had a history of successful collections new customers are subjected to a credit review process to evaluate the customers financial position and ability to pay if we determine at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable revenue is recognized upon receipt of payment stock rotation rights and price protection we provide certain distributors with stock rotation rights and price protection stock rotation rights are generally limited to a maximum amount per quarter and require a corresponding order of equal or greater value at the time of the stock rotation we provide price protection as a rebate in the event that we reduce the price of products that our distributors have yet to sell to end users we estimate potential stock rotation and price protection claims based on historical experience and the level of inventories in the distribution channel and reduce current period revenue accordingly if we cannot reasonably estimate claims related to stock rotations and price protection at the outset of an arrangement we recognize revenue when the claims can be reasonably estimated valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions we allocate portions of the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets consisting of acquired technologies distributor and customer relationships tradenames and non compete agreements based on independent appraisals received after each acquisition with the remainder allocated to goodwill we assess the realizability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives pursuant to sfas no goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to perform a sfas no impairment test at least annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our annual impairment date is june we have determined that the reporting unit level is our sole operating segment the test for goodwill is a two step process first we compare the carrying amount of our reporting unit which is the book value of the entire company to the fair value of our reporting unit if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value we have to perform the second step of the process if not no further testing is needed if the second part of the analysis is required we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test table of contents we then compare the implied fair value of our reporting units goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of our reporting units goodwill exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value we review our long lived assets including amortizable intangibles for impairment when events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets when we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present for an asset we compare the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate we compare the fair value to the book value of the asset if the fair value is less than the book value we recognize an impairment loss the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value some of the events that we consider as impairment indicators for our long lived assets including goodwill are our net book value compared to our market capitalization significant adverse economic and industry trends significant decrease in the market value of the asset the extent that we use an asset or changes in the manner that we use it and significant changes to the asset since we acquired it in the fourth quarter of fiscal we determined that certain tradenames were no longer going to be utilized and we wrote off the remaining net book value by recording additional amortization expense of at june goodwill and intangible assets were million and million respectively a decrease in the value of our business could trigger an impairment charge related to goodwill and or amortizable intangible assets accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each federal state and international jurisdiction in which we operate this process requires that we estimate the current tax expense as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our balance sheet and results of operations we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on our assessment establish a valuation allowance if required stock based compensation prior to june we accounted for employee stock option plans based on the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and had adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no accounting for stock based compensation sfas no as amended by sfas no accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no accordingly compensation cost for stock options was measured as the excess if any of the quoted market price of the companys stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock the company granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant therefore the company did not record stock based compensation expense under apb opinion no in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no r share based payment sfas no r to require that compensation cost relating to share based payment arrangements be recognized in financial statements as of july we adopted sfas no r using the modified prospective table of contents method which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of stock options are determined using the black scholes valuation model which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for stock options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no as amended by sfas no such fair value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures the adoption of sfas nor resulted in no cumulative change in accounting as of the date of adoption on march the securities and exchange commission published staff accounting bulletin no sab no which provides the staffs views on a variety of matters relating to stock based payments sab no requires stock based compensation to be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation information about stock based compensation included in the results of operations is as follows in thousands year ended june cost of revenues selling and marketing research and development general and administrative sfas no r provides that income tax effects of share based payments are recognized in the financial statements for those awards which will normally result in tax deductions under existing tax law under current us federal and uk tax laws we would receive a compensation expense deduction related to non qualified stock options only when those options are exercised and vested shares are received accordingly the financial statement recognition of compensation cost for non qualified stock options creates a deductible temporary difference which results in a deferred tax asset and a corresponding deferred tax benefit in the income statement we do not recognize a tax benefit for compensation expense related to incentive stock options isos unless the underlying shares are disposed of in a disqualifying disposition accordingly compensation expense related to isos is treated as a permanent difference for income tax purposes which increases the effective tax rate for stock based compensation arrangements we make judgments about the fair value of the awards including the expected term of the award volatility of the underlying stock and estimated forfeitures which impact the amount of compensation expense recognized in the financial statements results of operations net revenues in thousands net revenue percentage change over prior period we derive revenues primarily from the sale of thin client devices which include a device and related software and services net revenues decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower sales of our products to our top five us based large enterprise customers that contributed million in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal we
