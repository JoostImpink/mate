motivated changes in the consumption habits of the retail consumer which continues to impact our financial results economic uncertainty tumultuous market conditions and low levels of consumer confidence have created changes in the type of products purchased by our customers and increased the competitive environment in our primary markets we compete with other traditional grocery retailers as well as other retail outlets including but not limited to discount retailers such as neighborhood or supercenters and club and warehouse stores specialty supermarkets and drug stores generally our markets continue to experience new store opening activity and increased feature pricing or everyday low prices by competitors we utilize information gathered from various sources including our very important customer vic loyalty card program and work with suppliers to deliver effective retail pricing and targeted promotional spending programs that drive customer traffic and create value for our

the district of columbia southern maryland and coastal delaware during fiscal the company acquired square feet of additional distribution capacity that is contiguous to its existing distribution facility in greensboro north carolina this represented an approximate increase in the square footage of the companys existing distribution facilities and was acquired to meet our continued growth

and fiscal was attributable to increases in comparable store sales see definition below and sales from new stores that were partially offset by store closings comparable store sales for fiscal increased million as compared to increases of million in fiscal and million in fiscal comparable store sales have been negatively impacted to some extent by the cannibalization created by strategically opening stores in key major markets that have a close proximity to existing stores management believes that the companys strategy of opening additional stores within close proximity to existing stores and any similar new additions in the foreseeable future have a strategic benefit of enabling the company to capture sales and expand market share as the markets it serves continue to grow during fiscal the company increased the number of stores in operation by eight as compared to a net increase of five stores in each of fiscal and fiscal the increase in sales from new stores exceeded the loss of sales from closed stores by million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company has responded to its customers changing buying habits with increased promotional activity designed to increase the overall value to the customers during fiscal on a comparable basis active vic customer households and the average number of items sold increased store brand penetration has also increased on a year over year basis store brand penetration based on units sold increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal store brand penetration based on sales dollars increased by basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the company considers its reporting of comparable store sales growth to be effective in determining core sales growth during periods of fluctuation in the number of stores in operation their locations and their sizes while there is no standard industry definition of comparable store sales the company has been consistently applying the following definition comparable store sales are computed using corresponding calendar weeks to account for the occasional extra week included in a fiscal year a new store must be in operation for months before it enters into the calculation of comparable store sales a closed store is removed from the calculation in the month in which its closure is announced a new store opening within an approximate two mile radius of an existing store that is to be closed as a result of the new store opening is included as a replacement store in the comparable store sales measurement as if it were the same store sales increases resulting from existing comparable stores that are expanded in size are included in the calculations of comparable store sales if the store remains open during the construction period if the location is closed during the construction period or if the location is completely rebuilt it is reported as a replacement store and included in the same store sales calculation for the weeks actually open the comparable store sales increase for fiscal was computed on a week basis by reducing the week fiscal sales for the first week of the annual period gross profit gross profit as a percent to sales increased basis points from fiscal to fiscal and basis points from fiscal to fiscal as a result of improved retail gross profit margins realized through our effective promotional activity the retail gross profit margin improved by basis points from fiscal to fiscal and basis points from fiscal to the annual lifo adjustment for fiscal was a credit which

operations for fiscal included deferred tax expense of million relating to a valuation allowance for additional capital losses recognized in connection with the sale of ae outlook as described previously the merger with a subsidiary of kroger is pending under the terms of the merger agreement the company is required to continue to operate its business in the ordinary course pending the merger and not take certain specified actions prior to the completion of the proposed merger accordingly the following represents managements current outlook assuming the company continues to operate in the ordinary course the companys operating performance and strong financial position provide the flexibility to continue with its store development program for new and replacement stores along with the remodeling and expansion of existing stores during fiscal the company plans to open new stores which includes two replacements and seven acquired piggly wiggly store locations the fiscal new store openings are currently scheduled for eight in the first quarter three in the second quarter two in the third quarter and five in the fourth quarter during the first quarter of fiscal the company re opened the store in the washington dc market that was closed to repair damage caused by flooding the store development program is expected to result in a increase in retail square footage as compared to a increase realized in fiscal the company routinely evaluates its existing store operations in regards to its overall business strategy and from time to time will close or divest older or underperforming stores the new store program anticipates the continued expansion of harris teeters existing markets including the washington dc metro market area which incorporates northern virginia the district of columbia southern maryland and coastal delaware real estate development by its nature is both unpredictable and subject to external factors including weather construction schedules and costs any change in the amount and timing of new store development can impact the expected capital expenditures sales and operating results startup costs associated with opening new stores can negatively impact operating margins and net income in the current competitive environment promotional costs to maintain market share could also negatively impact operating margins and net income in future periods the continued execution of productivity initiatives implemented throughout all stores maintaining controls over waste implementation of operating efficiencies and effective merchandising strategies will dictate the pace at which the companys operating results could improve if at all the retail grocery market remains intensely competitive including the possibility of new competitors coming into the companys existing markets as such the company will continue to refine its merchandising strategies to respond to the intense competition and changing shopping demands capital resources and liquidity the companys principal source of liquidity has been cash generated from operating activities of harris teeter and borrowings available under the companys credit facility during fiscal the net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was driven by higher earnings and the timing of accruals and related payments associated with normal operations investing activities in fiscal required million of cash as compared to million utilized in fiscal fiscal investing activities included among other items approximately million in cash proceeds from the sale of ae and million of cash paid for the lowes foods transaction fiscal investing activities were million and included harris teeters sale of its ownership position in five investment properties along with one owned property which generated million of cash and the companys sale of a foreign investment which generated million of cash historically capital spending has been financed by cash provided by operating activities and supplemented with borrowings under the companys credit facility financing activities in fiscal utilized million of cash as compared to million utilized in fiscal and million utilized in fiscal fiscal financing activities included million for the repayment of the term loan under the companys prior credit facility and fiscal financing activities included a net reduction of million of borrowings under the companys prior credit facility financing activity also included million for the payment of dividends in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures totaled million as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to total approximately million the company anticipates that its capital investment for new store growth and store remodels will be concentrated in its existing markets for fiscal as well as in the foreseeable future the company has sufficient resources through internally generated funds and borrowings available under the companys credit facility to complete the planned capital investment management believes that the companys revolving line of credit provides sufficient liquidity for what management expects the company will require through the expiration of the line of credit on january on january the company amended and restated its then existing credit agreement that provided financing under a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit the prior credit agreement was due to expire in december of and the company had previously repaid million of the term loan prior to the closing of the amended credit facility the amended credit facility contains a revolving line of credit that provides for financing up to million through its termination date on january in connection with the closing of the amended credit agreement the company repaid the remaining million term loan under the prior credit facility utilizing million of cash and million of borrowings under the new revolver which new borrowings were subsequently repaid in the third quarter of fiscal the amended credit agreement provides for an optional increase of the revolving credit facility by an additional amount of up to million if the existing or new lenders agree to assume the additional commitments and two one year maturity extension options both of which require consent of certain of the lenders outstanding borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate at the companys option at a an alternate base rate based on a reference to rates on federal funds transactions with members of the federal reserve system the prime rate or the libor market index rate in effect on the interest determination date b the libor market index rate or c a libor rate each plus an applicable margin as determined by the administrative agent in accordance with the terms of the amended credit agreement the amount which may be borrowed from time to time and the applicable margin to the referenced interest rate are each dependent on a leverage factor the leverage factor is based on a ratio of rent adjusted consolidated funded debt divided by earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and operating rents as set forth in the amended credit agreement the more significant of the financial covenants that the company must meet during the term of the amended credit agreement include a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio the amended credit agreement restricts the companys ability to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments as defined in the amended credit agreement if after giving effect to such restricted payment an event of default under the amended credit agreement would exist or the company would not be in compliance with certain specified financial covenants however management does not expect these restrictions will affect the companys ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future as of october the company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the amended credit facility issued letters of credit reduced the amount available for borrowings under the amended credit facility and amounted to million as of october in addition to the million of borrowings available under the companys amended credit facility the company has the capacity to borrow up to an aggregate amount of million from two major us life insurance companies utilizing certain insurance assets as collateral in the normal course of business the company will continue to evaluate other financing opportunities based on the companys needs and market conditions covenants in certain of the companys long term debt agreements limit the total indebtedness that the company may incur as of october the amount of additional debt that could be incurred within the limitations of the most restrictive debt covenants exceeded the borrowings available under the amended credit facility as such management believes that the limit on indebtedness does not restrict the companys ability to meet future liquidity requirements through borrowings available under the companys amended credit facility including any liquidity requirements expected in connection with the companys expansion plans for the foreseeable future contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of its operations and financing activities financial obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that the company is required to make under existing contractual arrangements such as debt and lease agreements management expects that cash provided by operations and other sources of liquidity such as the companys amended credit facility and new sources of financing available to the company will be sufficient to meet these obligations on a short and long term basis the following table represents the scheduled maturities of the companys contractual obligations as of october in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases capital lease obligations purchase obligations fixed assets purchase obligations service contractsother unrecognized tax liability other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations for a more detailed description of the obligations see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof amounts represent total expected payments of principal and interest represents the minimum rents payable and includes leases associated with closed stores the obligations related to the closed store leases are discussed below amounts are not offset by expected sublease income and do not include various contingent liabilities associated with assigned leases as discussed below for a more detailed description of the obligation refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof the timing of payment if any for the unrecognized tax liability is not certain however we believe that we could possibly be assessed on the tax issues within the next three years represents the projected cash payments associated with certain deferred compensation contracts the net present value of these obligations is recorded by the company and included with other long term liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheets the table above excludes funding of the harris teeter supermarkets inc employees pension plan the pension plan payments pursuant to the supplemental executive retirement plan the serp and payments pursuant to the companys flexible deferred compensation and survivor benefit plans the companys funding policy in regards to the pension plan is to contribute annually the amount required by regulatory authorities to meet minimum funding requirements and an amount to increase the funding ratios over future years to a level determined by the companys actuaries to be effective in reducing the volatility of contributions however the timing and amount of such contributions or payments may be impacted by a number of factors including government regulation returns on plan assets and actuarial assumptions regarding our future funding obligations the company was not required to make a contribution to the pension plan in fiscal payments made pursuant to the serp flexible deferred compensation and survivor benefit plans are not required to be funded in advance and are equal to the benefit payments made during the year actual payments will be based on various external factors such as retirement dates and mortality annual payments pursuant to the serp are expected to range between million and million over the next five years benefit payments for the flexible deferred compensation plan or survivor benefit plan cannot be reasonably estimated due to the various external factors noted above for a more detailed description of our pension obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof in connection with the closing of certain store locations the company has assigned leases to several sub tenants with recourse these leases expire over the next years and the future minimum lease payments of approximately million in the aggregate over that future period have been assumed by these sub tenants in the unlikely event in managements opinion based on the current operations and credit worthiness of the assignees that all such contingent obligations would be payable by the company the approximate aggregate amounts due by year would be as follows million in fiscal stores million in fiscal stores million in fiscal stores million in fiscal stores million in fiscal stores and million in aggregate during all remaining years thereafter the company utilizes various standby letters of credit and bonds as required from time to time by certain programs most significantly for self insured programs such as workers compensation and various casualty insurance these letters of credit and bonds do not represent additional obligations of the company since the underlying liabilities are recorded as insurance accruals and included with other current liabilities on the companys consolidated balance sheets in addition the company occasionally utilizes documentary letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise in the normal course of business issued and outstanding letters of credit totaled million as of october as previously discussed during the first quarter of fiscal the company closed on the acquisition of certain piggly wiggly store locations the companys cash commitments for the acquisition and assumed leases are as follows million for less than one year million in years million in years and million in more than years the company expects to pay certain merger related costs including investment banker fees change in control payments and retention bonuses upon or after the close of the pending merger with kroger the companys current estimate of the cash commitments for these merger related costs are as follows million for less than one year million in years and million in years recent accounting pronouncements in february the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard updated reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu asu requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component the asu is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those periods beginning after december the asu will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements off balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore managements determination of estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities requires the exercise of judgment in the selection and application of assumptions based on various factors including historical experience current and expected economic conditions and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates the company constantly reviews the relevant significant factors and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate management has identified the following accounting policies as the most critical in the preparation of the companys financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain vendor rebates credits and promotional allowances consistent with standard practices in the retail industry the company receives allowances from vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements given the highly promotional nature of the retail supermarket industry the allowances are generally intended to defray the costs of promotion advertising and selling the vendors products examples of such arrangements include but are not limited to promotional markdown and rebate allowances cooperative advertising funds volume allowances store opening discounts and support and slotting stocking and display allowances the amount of such allowances may be determined on the basis of a fixed dollar amount negotiated with the vendor an amount per unit purchased or as a percentage of total purchases from the vendor or amounts based on sales to the customer number of stores in store displays or advertising the proper recognition and timing of accounting for these items are significant to the reporting of the results of operations of the company the company applies the authoritative guidance of the securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin no sab no revenue recognition subtopic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc and other authoritative guidance as appropriate under sab no revenue recognition requires as a prerequisite the completion of the earnings process and its realization or assurance of realizability vendor rebates credits and other promotional allowances that relate to harris teeters buying and merchandising activities including lump sum payments associated with long term contracts are recorded as a component of cost of sales as they are earned the recognition of which is determined in accordance with the underlying agreement with the vendor the authoritative guidance and completion of the earning process portions of vendor allowances that are refundable to the vendor in whole or in part by the nature of the provisions of the contract are deferred from recognition until realization is reasonably assured the companys practices are in accordance with asc subtopic and are based on the premise that the accounting for these vendor allowances should follow the economic substance of the underlying transactions which is evidenced by the agreement with the vendor as long as the allowance is distinguishable from the merchandise purchase consistent with this premise the company recognizes allowances when the purpose for which the vendor funds were intended and committed to be used has been fulfilled and a cost has been incurred by the retailer thus it is the companys policy to recognize the vendor allowance consistent with the timing of the recognition of the expense that the allowance is intended to reimburse and to determine the accounting classification consistent with the economic substance of the underlying transaction where the company provides an identifiable benefit or service to the vendor apart from the purchase of merchandise that transaction is recorded separately for example co operative advertising allowances are accounted for as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising cost is incurred if the advertising allowance exceeds the cost of advertising then the excess is recorded against the cost of sales in the period in which the related expense is recognized there are numerous types of rebates and allowances in the retail industry the companys accounting practices with regard to some of the more typical arrangements are discussed as follows vendor allowances for price markdowns are credited to the cost of sales during the period in which the related markdown was taken and charged to the cost of sales slotting and stocking allowances received from a vendor to ensure that its products are carried or to introduce a new product at the companys stores are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales over the period covered by the agreement with the vendor based on the estimated inventory turns of the merchandise to which the allowance applies display allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in the period earned in accordance with the vendor agreement based on the estimated inventory turns of the merchandise to which the allowance applies volume rebates by the vendor in the form of a reduction of the purchase price of the merchandise reduce the cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold generally volume rebates under a structured purchase program with allowances awarded based on the level of purchases are recognized when realization is assured as a reduction in the cost of sales in the appropriate monthly period based on the actual level of purchases in the period relative to the total purchase commitment and adjusted for the estimated inventory turns of the merchandise some of these typical vendor rebate credit and promotional allowance arrangements require that the company make assumptions and judgments regarding for example the likelihood of attaining specified levels of purchases or selling specified volumes of products the duration of carrying a specified product and the estimation of inventory turns vendor allowances that have not been earned are recorded as either unearned revenue or as an offset to the carrying value of inventory and totaled million and million as of october and october respectively the company constantly reviews the relevant significant factors and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate historically the companys assumptions and judgments regarding vendor rebates credits and promotional allowances have been reasonably accurate management believes that future changes in these assumptions and judgments are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the companys financial condition and results of operation inventory valuation merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market with the cost of a substantial portion of inventories being determined using the last in first out lifo method limited categories of inventories are valued on the first in first out fifo cost methods in total approximately and of inventories were valued using the lifo method as of the end of fiscals and respectively cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method the excess of estimated current costs over the lifo carrying value or lifo reserve was approximately million and million as of october and october respectively lifo assumes that the last costs in are the ones that should be used to measure the cost of goods sold leaving the earlier costs residing in the ending inventory valuation the company uses the link chain method of computing dollar value lifo whereby the base year values of beginning and ending inventories are determined using a cumulative price index the company generates an estimated internal index to link current costs to the original costs of the base years in which the company adopted lifo the companys determination of the lifo index is driven by the change in current year costs as well as the change in inventory quantities on hand under the lifo valuation method all retail store inventories are initially stated at estimated cost as calculated by the retail inventory method rim under rim the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including markups markdowns lost inventory shrinkage percentages and the purity and similarity of inventory sub categories as to their relative inventory turns gross margins and on hand quantities these judgments and estimates can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as gross margin management believes that the companys rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying the inventory at the lower of cost or market historically the companys assumptions and judgments regarding the companys rim have been reasonably accurate management does not believe that the likelihood is significant that materially higher lifo reserves are required given its current expectations of on hand inventory quantities and costs the proper valuation of inventory also requires management to estimate the net realizable value of the companys obsolete and slow moving inventory at the end of each period management bases its net realizable values upon many factors including historical recovery rates the aging of inventories on hand the inventory movement of specific products and the current economic conditions when management has determined inventory to be obsolete or slow moving the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value by recording an obsolescence valuation allowance given the companys experiences in selling obsolete and slow moving inventory management believes that the historical estimates used to value obsolete and slow moving inventory have been reasonably accurate with regard to the proper valuations of inventories management reviews its judgments assumptions and other relevant significant factors on a routine basis and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate self insurance accruals for workers compensation healthcare and general liability the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation claims healthcare claims and general liability and automotive liability losses the company has purchased insurance coverage in order to establish certain limits to its exposure on a per claim basis the companys self insurance accruals for workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance totaled million and million as of october and october respectively actual workers compensation claims and general liability and automotive liability losses are reported to the company by third party administrators the third party administrators also report initial estimates of related loss the open claims and initial loss estimates are subjected to examination by the companys risk management and accounting management utilizing a consistent methodology which involves various assumptions judgment and other factors such factors include but are not limited to the probability of settlement the amount at which settlement can be achieved the probable duration of the claim the cost development pattern of the claim and the applicable cost development factor the company determines the estimated accruals required for worker compensation claims in each accounting period this requires that management determine estimates of the costs of claims incurred and accrue for such expenses in the period in which the claims are incurred the company measures the liabilities associated with claims for workers compensation general liability and automotive liability through the use of actuarial methods to project an estimate of ultimate cost for claims incurred the estimated cost for claims incurred are discounted to present values using a discount rate representing a return on high quality fixed income securities with an average maturity equal to the average payout of the related liability a basis point decrease in the discount rate would not significantly increase the estimated liabilities the company constantly reviews the relevant significant factors and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate the variety of healthcare plans available to employees are primarily self insured the company records an accrual for the estimated amount of self insured healthcare claims incurred by all participants but not yet reported ibnr using an actuarial method of applying a development factor to the reported claims amount the most significant factors which impact on the determination of the required accrual are the historical pattern of the timeliness of claims processing changes in the nature or types of benefit plans changes in the plan benefit designs employer employee cost sharing factors and medical trends and inflation the companys total accrual for self insured healthcare claims totaled million and million as of october and october respectively historical experience is continually monitored and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances management believes that the use of actuarial studies to determine self insurance accruals represents a consistent method of measuring these subjective estimates impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets and closed store obligations the company assesses its goodwill and other long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the net non discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of net book value over the estimated fair value of the asset impaired the fair value is estimated based on expected future cash flows the value of property and equipment associated with closed stores and facilities is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on the companys prior history of disposing of similar assets and current economic conditions management continually reviews its fair value estimates and records impairment charges for assets held for sale when management determines based on new information which it believes to be reliable that such charges are appropriate the results of impairment tests are subject to managements estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows and operating results the company believes that based on current estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows materially different reported results are not likely to result from the impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets however a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different reported results the company records liabilities for closed stores that are under long term lease agreements the liability represents an estimate of the present value of the remaining non cancelable lease payments after the anticipated closing date net of estimated subtenant income the closed store liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores unless settled earlier management estimates the subtenant income and future cash flows based on its historical experience and knowledge of the market in which the store is located the results of its previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions the actual cost of disposition for these leases is affected by specific real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions and may differ significantly from those assumed and estimated store closings generally are completed within one year after the decision to close adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenants and actual costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that such settlement is determined the company periodically reviews the relevant significant factors used in its estimates and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate the companys closed store liability amounted to million and million as of october and october respectively individual closed store liabilities are likely to be adjusted up or down in the future to reflect changes in assumptions however the companys historical assumptions and judgments regarding closed store liabilities have been reasonably accurate retirement plans and post retirement benefit plans the company maintains certain retirement benefit plans for substantially all full time employees and supplemental retirement benefit plans for certain selected directors and officers of the company and its subsidiaries the qualified pension plan is a non contributory funded defined benefit plan while the non qualified supplemental retirement benefit plans are unfunded defined benefit plans the companys current funding policy for its qualified pension plan is to contribute annually an amount in excess of the contributions required by regulatory authorities to meet minimum funding requirements as determined by its actuaries to be effective in increasing the funding ratios and reducing the volatility of future contributions the company has certain deferred compensation arrangements which allow or allowed in prior years its directors officers and selected key management personnel to forego the receipt of earned compensation for specified periods of time the company may also from time to time make discretionary annual contributions into the director deferral plan on behalf of its outside directors these plans are unfunded the company utilizes a rabbi trust to hold assets set aside to pay the respective liabilities of these plans for further disclosures regarding the companys pension and deferred compensation plans see note to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof the company maintains a post retirement healthcare plan for retirees whose sum of age and years of service equal at least at retirement the plan continues coverage from early retirement date until the earlier date of eligibility for medicare or any other employers medical plan the company requires that the retiree pay the estimated full cost of the coverage the company also provides a post retirement mortality benefit to a small number of retirees under a prior plan the obligations and expenses associated with each of these benefit plans are not material the determination of the companys obligation and expense for pension deferred compensation and other post retirement benefits is dependent on certain assumptions selected by management and used by the company and its actuaries in calculating such amounts the more significant of those assumptions applicable to the qualified pension plan include the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets the rates of increase in future compensation and the rates of future employee turnover those assumptions also apply to determinations of the obligations and expense of the following plans except as noted supplemental pension no funded assets to be measured and deferred compensation arrangement and post retirement mortality benefit no funded assets to be measured and no dependency on future rates of compensation or turnover in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from managements assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the companys recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods while management believes that its selections of values for the various assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of the harris teeter supermarkets inc employees pension plan the pension plan and the harris teeter supermarkets inc supplemental executive retirement plan the serp liabilities is illustrated below in millions percentage point change projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase pension plan discount rate + pension plan return on assets + serp discount rate + item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments the companys exposure to market risks results primarily from changes in interest rates generally the fair value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall and the fair value will decrease as interest rates rise the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest
