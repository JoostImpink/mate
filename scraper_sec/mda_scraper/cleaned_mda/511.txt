item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following mda is to help facilitate an understanding of the significant factors influencing our historical operating results financial condition and cash flows and also to convey managements expectations of the potential impact of known trends events or uncertainties that may materially impact future results this mda contains forward looking statements as described on page i of this annual report on form k forward looking statements contained in the following mda exclude the potential effects of the proposed cvs merger unless otherwise expressly stated our mda should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k overview we are one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states our services assist employers insurance companies unions government employee groups managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states in delivering prescription drugs in a cost effective manner our pharmaceutical services are generally referred to as pharmacy benefit management or pbm services and involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the costs and improving the safety effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use we generate our net revenue primarily from dispensing prescription drugs either directly through our mail service pharmacies or indirectly through our network of third party retail pharmacies and through providing certain other services including health management health benefits management and data access to our customers which are primarily employers unions government employee groups insurance companies managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states our net revenue represents amounts earned from both our customers and the participants in our customers health benefit plans and includes copayments paid by participants both to us for prescriptions filled from pharmacies we own and to the third party pharmacies in our retail network for most retail prescriptions our net revenues reflect the effects of any discounts provided to our customers see note summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for detailed information concerning our revenue recognition policies we generate cost savings for our customers primarily by negotiating for the discounted purchase of pharmaceutical products dispensed to their participants we purchase pharmaceutical products from and negotiate various forms of discounts from established benchmark prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers pharmaceutical wholesalers and retail pharmacies when we purchase pharmaceutical products directly from their manufacturer as is typically the case with generic and biotech products we generally receive any negotiated discount at the time of purchase when we purchase pharmaceutical products indirectly eg through index to financial statements a wholesaler or from a retail pharmacy at the point of dispensing as is typically the case with brand name nonbiotech products we generally receive a discount from the vendor and in many cases the products manufacturer in these cases the vendor discount is received at the time of purchase however the manufacturer discount is received after the product is dispensed our cost of revenues reflects the effects of these discounts the prices we have negotiated with our customers for the pharmaceutical products we dispense to their participants are generally based on contractual discounts from established benchmark prices and may also include additional discounts based on the type ie preferred brand non preferred brand generic etc of prescriptions filled most of our customer contracts utilize an average wholesale price awp benchmark to establish pricing the prices in our vendor contracts with various parties manufacturers wholesalers retail pharmacies etc for the purchase of these pharmaceuticals are also based on discounts from established benchmark prices plus in many cases additional discounts in the form of prompt payment terms and or rebates recent events have raised uncertainties as to whether payors pharmacy providers pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry specifically in a proposed settlement in a civil class action case brought against first databank fdb one of several companies that report data on prescription drug prices and mckesson corporation fdb has agreed to reduce the reported awp of certain drugs by four percent and to discontinue the publishing of awp at a future time as contemplated by the settlement at this time the proposed settlement has not received final court approval the court could approve the proposed settlement in part in its entirety or not at all we cannot predict the outcome of this case or if the settlement is approved the precise timing of any of the proposed awp changes or the effect of such changes if any on the financial performance of the company over of our customer relationships and most of our relationships with other affected parties contain terms that we believe will enable us to mitigate the adverse effect of this proposed reduction in fdbs reported awp two other publicly traded large national pbms have also stated that their contractual relationships contain similar terms however because in some cases payors may seek to negotiate with pbms in an effort to reduce prescription drug costs as a result of a reduction in fbds reported awp the ultimate effect of this development on us cannot be precisely predicted whatever the outcome of the fdb case it is possible that payors pharmacy providers and pbms will begin to evaluate other pricing benchmarks as the basis for contracting for prescription drugs and pharmacy benefit management services in the future additionally both our customer and vendor contracts typically contain clauses which would allow us to renegotiate pricing in the event that legislation or other events limiting or eliminating the various discounting practices in the pharmaceutical industry including the practice of providing discounts in the form of rebates were to occur we generate our net revenue primarily from dispensing prescription drugs on behalf of our customers we dispense these prescriptions drugs through our seven large automated mail service pharmacies our smaller regional specialty mail service pharmacies and a nationwide network composed of over retail pharmacies with which we have contracted to purchase pharmaceuticals on behalf of our customers for immediate delivery to their participants one customer the federal employees health benefit plan accounted for approximately of our net revenue in on november we announced our intent to merge with cvs see item business proposed merger with cvs for further information concerning this proposed merger critical accounting policies and estimates income taxes we previously had a significant deferred tax asset related to federal and state income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards that were primarily generated from losses incurred in our discontinued ppm business the significant majority of these nols were utilized to offset taxable income for the year ended december and prior years due to the complexity of our discontinued operations divestiture and the fact index to financial statements that the tax periods in which the nols were generated can be audited well beyond a normal three year statutory audit period the amount of the nols which may ultimately be realized may vary materially from the amount utilized to offset taxable income we have established an accrual for tax related contingencies primarily related to issues which may arise from the tax periods when the nols were generated this accrual is based on our estimates of the amount of benefit from the nols that we may ultimately be unable to realize subsequent revisions to the accrual for tax related contingencies may cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period estimates concerning contingencies generally accepted accounting principles specify the criteria for disclosing contingent losses and recording any related estimate of the loss amount these criteria are based on both probability assessments of the eventual outcome of the contingent event and on the availability of information necessary to estimate the amount of the loss if it is determined that i it is probable a material loss has been incurred and ii the amount of the loss can be reliably estimated the nature of the loss should be disclosed and an estimate of the loss should be recorded if it is reasonably possible that a material loss has been incurred the nature of the possible loss should be disclosed along with an estimate of the amount of the loss if it is available to the extent that the incurrence of a material loss is judged remote no disclosure is required the most significant contingencies to which we are exposed other than the tax related contingencies discussed above relate to damages sought by claimants under various lawsuits and investigations the specific cases for which we believe it may be at least reasonably possible that we have incurred a loss are discussed further at item legal proceedings and in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k probability estimates related to the anticipated outcomes of lawsuitsinvestigations and to the amounts of damages which may ultimately be awarded are inherently uncertain we have made our estimates based on all available facts and circumstances existing as of the date such estimates were made although these estimates have been made based on our prior experience with litigationinvestigations our knowledge of the details of each case and in many cases our consultation with external legal counsel the actual outcome of pending litigation and investigations could differ materially from our estimates accounts receivable valuation allowances we are exposed to credit losses from accounts receivable that are recorded as assets in our financial statements but may ultimately be uncollectible and to adjustments to accounts receivable based on contractual interpretations and customer audits we perform detailed analyses of accounts receivable and related data on a monthly basis and have attempted to allow for expected adjustments based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable we believe our accounts receivable valuation allowances to be adequate however it is possible that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time we continually review and refine our estimation processes to make them as reactive to these changes as possible however we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate the amounts of these accounts receivable that will ultimately be collected medicare part d we have recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from our participation as a pdp in the federal governments medicare part d program based on information in our claims management and enrollment systems significant estimates arising from our participation in the medicare part d program include i estimates of low income cost subsidy and reinsurance amounts ultimately payable to or receivable from cms based on a detailed claims reconciliation that will occur in ii estimates of amounts payable to or receivable from other pdps state medicaid programs or individuals for claims costs incurred during the startup phase of the program where widespread retroactive enrollment changes were communicated by cms after such claims had been incurred and iii an estimate of amounts payable to cms under a risk sharing feature of the medicare part d program design referred to as the risk corridor actual amounts of medicare part d related assets and liabilities could differ materially from amounts recorded index to financial statements the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for managements judgment in their application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles factors that may affect future results our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to market our services profitably which is in turn heavily dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate discounts for pharmaceutical purchases at various points in our supply chain and to successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth our future operating results and financial condition may be affected by a number of additional factors including but not limited to i identification of and competition for growth and expansion opportunities ii our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers iii declining reimbursement levels for or increases in the costs of products dispensed including but not limited to the effect of changes in industry benchmarks used to determine pricing of products iv exposure to liabilities in excess of our insurance v compliance with or changes in government regulation and legislation including but not limited to pharmacy licensing requirements and healthcare reform legislation vi our participation in the federal governments medicare part d program vii adverse developments in the healthcare or pharmaceutical industry generally including but not limited to developments in any investigation related to the pharmaceutical industry that may be conducted by governmental authorities viii adverse resolution of existing or future lawsuits or investigations ix the availability of prescription drug products in the marketplace as affected by product recalls and voluntary product withdrawals by manufacturers x our ability to complete the proposed merger with cvs and xi the impact of the exchange offer commenced by express scripts changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition there are various legal matters which if adversely determined could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition see item legal proceedings and note to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on

which is a non gaap financial measure is a supplemental measurement tool used by analysts and investors to help evaluate a companys overall operating performance its ability to incur and service debt and its capacity for making capital expenditures we use ebitda in addition to operating income and cash flows from operating activities to assess our liquidity and performance and believe that it is important for investors to be able to evaluate our company using the same measures used by our management ebitda can be reconciled to net cash provided by continuing operations which we believe to be

of higher generic dispensing rates revenues for the year ended december would have increased approximately over the amount revenues from mail service claims increased million or to billion in the year ended december from billion in this increase results from an increase in mail service claim index to financial statements volume of approximately and an increase in average revenue per mail service

treasury lock gain on treasury lock is comprised of a million gain on a treasury lock that was previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge beginning in the third quarter of the treasury lock no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment due to our determination that we would not issue year fixed rate debt to replace our senior notes the treasury lock matured and was settled in the

taxes our provision for income taxes was recorded using a effective tax rate on book income in compared to an approximately effective tax rate on book income in the decrease related to a positive adjustment to the provision for income taxes primarily to reflect resolution of income tax uncertainties from prior periods historical liquidity and capital resources general we broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our obligations and commitments in addition liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing to meet our business objectives therefore liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving business objectives and meeting debt service commitments the following tables set forth selected information concerning our liquidity and capital resources and changes therein at and for the year ended december dollars in thousands net cash and cash equivalents provided by used in continuing operations investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the

facility working capital equals total current assets minus total current liabilities the december net working capital and fixed rate long term debt amounts reflect the classification of million of our senior notes due as long term debt due to our intent and ability to refinance this amount on a long term basis at the time of filing of our annual report on form k the amount classified as long term debt was limited to the availability under our revolving credit facility and the remaining million of our senior notes due is classified as a current liability as of december we ultimately did not refinance the notes on a long term basis and repaid the entire million principal amount of the notes using cash on hand when they matured in october see credit facility below for information on our amended credit facility index to financial statements cash flows from continuing operations our performance relative to net cash provided by continuing operations for the year ended december resulted from factors discussed above related to income from continuing operations and certain changes in non cash working capital the decline in operating cash flow compared to the year ended december was primarily driven by cash payments of federal income taxes in after we utilized the majority of our federal net operating loss carryforward in income tax payments net of refunds increased to million in from million in in addition as discussed under recent accounting pronouncements fas r changed the statement of cash flow classification of the excess tax benefit resulting from the exercise of stock options excess tax benefits were reported as cash flows from operating activities in but are reported as cash flows from financing activities in cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december primarily include million from the sale of available for sale securities and million in proceeds from the settlement of our treasury lock offset by

common stock under employee benefit plans including exercises of stock options and ii approximately million of tax benefit received for the amount of income tax deductions for option exercises in excess of compensation cost recognized for those options including pro forma share based compensation cost for periods prior to january credit facility on august we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the restated credit agreement that provides for a five year million revolving bank credit facility maturing on august the restated credit agreement replaced our previous bank credit facility which included a million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of march at december we had approximately million available for borrowing under the revolving bank credit facility exclusive of approximately million reserved under letters of credit the credit facility is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and contains restrictive covenants the guarantees and covenants applicable to the credit facility are described in further detail in note long term debt derivative financial instrument and interest rate risk management to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k senior notes our senior notes due with an aggregate principal amount of million matured and were repaid in october outlook liquidity and capital resources overview currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from i working capital requirements ii capital expenditures and iii dividend payments additionally we have acquired businesses recently may continue to acquire additional businesses in the future subject to compliance with the merger agreement and could fund any such acquisition using cash on hand and short term investments availability under our revolving credit facility or a combination thereof we believe that our cash on hand short term investments cash flows from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future stock repurchase program we are authorized to repurchase up to billion of our common stock on the open market under our previously announced repurchase program and subsequent amendments repurchases under the program will occur at times and in amounts that management deems appropriate subject to compliance with the merger agreement and we had repurchased approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately billion under this program through september no repurchases have been made subsequent to september index to financial statements contractual obligations and commercial commitments continuing operations we have various contractual obligations and or commercial commitments arising from both our continuing and discontinued operations these obligations and commitments are more fully described in this annual report on form k under various headings in

to our discontinued operations discontinued operations including off balance sheet guarantees future cash needed to fund the remaining liabilities of discontinued operations and estimated exit costs was estimated to be approximately million in aggregate at december consisting primarily of accruals for real estate leases and legal disputes we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising from our discontinued operations these primarily include obligations under various leases for commercial real estate these leases had aggregate remaining rental payments net of amounts to be paid to us under subleases of approximately million at december due as follows million million and million additionally we are named as guarantor or obligor on additional discontinued operations real estate leases which we assigned to third parties the aggregate amount of these guarantees totaled approximately million at december and expires as follows million million million and after million merger agreement we have entered into a merger agreement with cvs and have agreed to pay a fee of million to cvs if the merger agreement is terminated under any of the following circumstances the caremark rx board of directors makes a change in recommendation caremark rx willfully and materially breaches certain obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals or fails to call a stockholders meeting to vote on the merger agreement and the merger or the merger is not consummated by november or may if extended as permitted in the merger agreement or caremark rxs stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement and to approve the merger in each case only if i a third party has made an acquisition proposal before the caremark rx special meeting and ii within months of the termination of the merger agreement caremark rx enters into an alternative transaction in addition whether or not the merger is completed the uncertainty related to the proposed merger could adversely impact our business through several factors including but not limited to i our current clients may index to financial statements experience uncertainty associated with the merger and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us ii we may face additional challenges in competing for new and renewal business and iii pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies pharmacy benefit management companies or other vendors or suppliers may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships with us approximately one third of a pbms customer base typically is subject to renewal each year and therefore we may face additional challenges in competing for new business and retaining or renewing business our largest client the federal employees health benefits plan is currently subject to renewal for services beginning january there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure renewal of this business however such renewal is not a condition to the completion of the merger these disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects if the merger is not completed or of the combined company if the merger is completed see item business proposed merger with cvs for further information concerning this proposed merger express scripts exchange offer on january express scripts launched an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of caremark rx common stock for a in cash less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest and b shares of express scripts common stock for each share of caremark rx common stock on january our board of directors reaffirmed that the express scripts proposal does not constitute and is not reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal as defined in the merger agreement and that engaging in discussions with express scripts is not in the best interests of caremark rx and its stockholders express scripts exchange offer and its ongoing solicitation of proxies from caremark rx stockholders to vote against the cvs merger could impact or cause disruptions in our business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition including our current clients may experience uncertainty associated with the exchange offer and proxy solicitation and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us we may face additional challenges in competing for new and renewal business and the pendency or completion of any acquisition of caremark rx by express scripts could result in customer attrition including an estimated billion in lost revenue and a million reduction in earnings before interest and taxes ebit a metric commonly used to gauge a companys profitability and financial health our employees or prospective employees may experience uncertainty about job security which might adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key managers and other employees the attention of our management may be directed toward considerations related to the exchange offer and proxy solicitation and may be diverted from the day to day business operations of our business and pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies pharmacy benefit management companies or other vendors or suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with the exchange offer and proxy solicitation and may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships with us planned capital expenditures we expect capital expenditures for to total approximately million this amount could vary significantly depending on the timing of projects and related expenditures recent accounting pronouncements share based compensation we offer participation in our stock option plans to certain employees and directors as described further in note summary of significant accounting policies and in note stockholders equity to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and offer participation in our employee stock purchase plan espp to all employees effective january we adopted fas r index to financial statements using the modified prospective transition method described therein accordingly on january we began recognizing compensation cost from share based payment arrangements based on their grant date fair value under the modified prospective transition method compensation cost recognized in includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to but not vested as of january based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no accounting for stock based compensation fas and ii compensation cost
