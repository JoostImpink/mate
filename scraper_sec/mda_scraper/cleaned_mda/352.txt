development our canadian subsidiary infiknowledge ulc performs work for hire services in the production of internet games for third party vendors and participates in royalties related to the development launch and successful commercialization of such internet games our expansion in and dependence on our online direct marketing efforts coupled with the potential for state and or federal

segment information we operate in one segment online advertising and media services in classifying the financial information for our operating activities we rely primarily upon the evaluations of the chief operating decision maker codm as managed by committee and executive management in deciding how to allocate our resources and assess our performance disclosure is also required about products and services geographic areas and major customers at december management realigned the way it views operations internally and modified the format that we distribute reports and information to the codm in accordance with such realignment the lec billed products and services segment which was principally inactive in terms of its contributions to gross margin and income from operations from the period december to november was collapsed into our online advertising and media service activities and was no longer displayed as a separate segment within our codm reporting information and therefore was correspondingly reflected as such in our publicly disseminated financial information for the november and fiscal periods the companys income statements and notes to the financial statements were reclassified regarding segment disclosures and the collapse of the lec segment into our single segment presentation of online advertising and media services activities all information regarding

revenue component of our online advertising and media service activities included of legacy revenue from reserve releases from our prior lec segment such reserve releases were actual cash received by us from third party service bureaus that withheld amounts from our legacy lec segment in anticipation of bad debts actual bad debts proved less than amounts originally withheld at the point these monies were withheld in prior fiscal years we had treated them as contra revenue we do not anticipate future reserve releases if any will represent material amounts we sell services and not products and correspondingly do not carry inventory we had revenue from our canadian based subsidiary of approximately and during the fiscal years ended november and respectively the primary role of the canadian subsidiary is to support back office data operations and does not directly contribute significant amounts to consolidated net income the majority of the canadian subsidiarys outlays are related to the generation of our revenues correspondingly we classify them within the categories of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses where appropriate segment information

our increased focus on our online advertising and media service activities as a result of recent acquisitions online advertising revenue includes the revenues we generate upon our resale of internet

declines in the delivery rates of our email marketing offers and b data sale rental and list management revenue declines of million or which resulted from the shift in our business where our increased reliance on search engine marketing and internet advertising revenue generated lesser amounts of data that would otherwise become available for sale and rental purposes when compared to our historical incentive based online web advertising focus our personals business the imatchupcom dating sites recognized a revenue decline of approximately million or as a result of declining customer enrollments in the latter part of fiscal and as expected in fiscal we experienced and expect to continue to experience a reduction in marketing efforts directed at obtaining new enrollments within the personals program competition for enrollees has driven the marketing costs in excess of our tolerable thresholds which is the reasoning behind our change in our customer contact strategy and resulting revenue declines the increase in internet game development revenue was attributable to an increase in successful games brought to market by our development partners in fiscal when compared to fiscal our cost of sales during the year ended november and were comprised of direct and indirect marketing costs associated with the acquisition and retention of consumers for our online advertising and media

in purchases of performance based online advertising space of million or as a result of a prior year acquisition within which we make direct purchases of online advertising space that is resold on a performance basis such increase was offset by a combined decline in website advertising registrations and total email costs of approximately million resulting from a shift to a greater reliance on search engine marketing to drive online advertising traffic coupled with an increased focus on internal email platform mailings and a lesser reliance on third party email vendors in our personals business costs incurred in the acquisition of new customer profiles decreased million or the decrease in customer profile cost correlates to our decreased emphasis on the acquisition of new enrollments during the last six months of fiscal the cost of enrollment escalation coupled with a decline in the billable life of existing customers caused us to decrease our spending budget for the

compared to in the prior year representing an absolute percentage point decrease of or a decrease on a relative basis the slight negative change in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to several offsetting factors our personals business the imatchupcom dating sites recognized a relative margin increase in fiscal and is the result of reductions in our new personals member acquisition budget and the benefit of the attritting billable customer base yielding a gross margin that was not encumbered by increasing acquisition costs the overall impact on gross margin dollars is minimal based on the fiscal decline in personals revenue of approximately million our online advertising activities gross margin remained relatively constant resulting from the loss of a material customer in the third quarter of fiscal partially offset by increased gross margins resulting from a greater reliance on search marketing in our online advertising efforts which replaced the prior periods greater reliance on marginally less profitable website registrations as well as a relative decline of in the gross margin recognized in our search engine marketing services provided to third parties in the continued expansion of our search engine marketing services we have recognized declines in the related gross margin as a result of maintaining such growth coupled with cost increases arising from

foreign earnings are fully taxed in canada and as such based on the lack of any foreign source income a foreign tax credit is not available to us on the related foreign taxes with such taxes being

competitive market forces affecting the cost of acquisition of registered users that are marketed our services and our clients products and services once registered search engine marketing gross margin decreased in absolute terms and in relative terms as a result of our significant expansion of our search engine marketing services and the related declines encountered in growing such business coupled with cost increases arising from increased competitive market conditions in our personals business we expense customer acquisition costs during the period we acquire a free personals membership account while the recognition of the revenue is dependent upon whether or not the free account converts to a paying membership the period that a free account may convert to a billable account ranges from one week after acquisition to as long as two years after its initial month of acquisition based on available historical conversion to billable experience the costs of acquiring free memberships has risen in fiscal approximately three fold and that conversion rates regarding first time conversion and renewal billing retention have both declined during fiscal with both factors having a negative impact on the future growth potential and the future fiscal period profit generating potential of our personals business we believe the primary cause for the cost increase results

fourth quarter revenue the majority of our customers are extended day credit terms in limited instances customer credit is extended in ranges exceeding days and in very limited circumstances can exceed days we continually monitor customer adherence to credit terms and constantly strive to improve the effectiveness of our collection efforts with the goal of achieving a dso in the day range future fiscal periods might not reflect this goal of a day dso and might exceed the day dso recognized during the year ended november historically our primary cash requirements have been used to fund the cost of advertising and promotion and test marketing new services and promotions with additional funds having been used in the purchasing of equipment and services in connection with the commencement of new business lines further development of businesses being test marketed and for the development of the equipment infrastructure of our subsidiaries our future plans and business strategy may continue to call for our internet based on line advertising and media service activities to be our sole operating focus as it was for the years ended november and our cash demands for capital expenditures and equipment lease obligations have increased to million during the year ended november compared to million during the year ended november our capital expenditures and capital lease obligation payments during the fiscal years ended november to were in millions and respectively the significant portion of fiscal and s capital expenditure was for new email servers that substantially reduced our reliance on and related additional costs associated with third party email delivery suppliers all other outlays for capital expenditures were also used to support other facets of our online advertising and media services business we may in future fiscal periods be required to invest significant amounts of capital into our business if our operations fail to generate sufficient revenue we could realize a material adverse impact on our capital and liquidity resources resulting from expenditures necessary to generate such revenue including but not limited to expenditures for a marketing campaigns including media costs and other costs of customer acquisition information b service and or product development costs c site development and maintenance and related technology based costs d potential online and or off line business acquisitions or e costs associated with developing alternative means of email promotion delivery on january we through our wholly owned subsidiary hot rocket acquisition corp acquired all of the intangible assets of hot rocket marketing inc and clockwork advertising inc collectively hot rocket corporations in the business of buying and selling performance based online advertising space for third parties as well as providing such services to the sales activities of our consolidated entity the hot rocket acquisition has broadened our reach into the internet direct marketing arena which continues to allow for expanded client relationships and various other synergistic possibilities such as adding value to our core operations by the enhancement of our current and developing marketing programs conducted in our online advertising and media services activities the initial purchase price was approximately million and was comprised of million in cash million or shares of our common stock and transaction fees approximating million pursuant to an independent third party valuation the reported purchase price was allocated approximately million towards goodwill and million of identifiable intangibles there were no tangible assets acquired in addition to the initial purchase price of the acquisition we agreed to pay hot rocket a contingent purchase price of up to million if hot rocket generates an aggregate of million in ebitda as quantified in the agreement over the four year period following the closing in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement for the period february to january we were liable for a combined additional purchase price payment of million which has been settled by a cash payment of approximately million made on may and an issuance of shares issued on may then having a fair market value of approximately million future contingent payments made if any will be treated as additional purchase price and included as an addition to goodwill the terms of the acquisition agreement also provide for additional contingent payments of purchase price for the periods february through july and august through january upon the attainment of certain ebitda thresholds as specified in the agreement hot rocket did not reach the million ebitda threshold for the period ended july and the possibility exists that for the period ending january the ebitda threshold will not be attained therefore as of november based on the lack of absolute certainty regarding the ebitda threshold as it relates to the additional payment period ending january we have not accrued any additional contingent payments at this time future contingencies if any will be recorded when the contingency has been satisfied and the additional consideration is issued or becomes issuable the shares of common stock issued to hot rocket were originally issued by us in non public transactions which issuances were exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act pursuant to section thereof on june we consummated the acquisition of the assets of sendtrafficcom inc send and its affiliated entity the traffic group llc tg privately held search engine marketing companies based in new york we purchased the assets for approximately million comprised of million in cash and shares of traffix common stock the asset acquisition agreement calls for contingent earn out payments based on the post closing attainment of certain earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda thresholds during the thirty six month period following the transaction as of november none of the contractual thresholds were attained and it is not deemed probable that any remaining threshold will be reached during the remainder of the post closing period under currently proposed operating plans and assumptions management believes that projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources and working capital as described above will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months additionally as we seek to further extend our reach into the online advertising and media services arena as well as potentially identify new and other consumer oriented services and products we may use existing cash reserves enter into long term financing arrangements acquire the assets or securities of other companies or employ other means to finance such diversification none of which is specifically identifiable or measurable at this time

accounting estimate discussion which is set forth below that are reasonably likely to cause a material impact either positive or negative on our liquidity trends additionally we do not have off

commissions statement regarding the selection and disclosure by public companies of critical accounting policies and practices we have set forth below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows if general business conditions or individual customer financial circumstances change in an adverse way relative to the policies and estimates used in the attached financial statements or in any forward looking statements contained herein estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period actual results could differ from those estimates our most significant estimates relate to reserves for uncollectible receivables recoverability of long lived assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets additionally we have potential exposure resulting from pending and or threatened litigation for which we currently assess no risk and do not provide for loss no provision for loss has been recorded for the potential of currently unknown actions naming us as defendant in future fiscal periods actual results could differ from our estimates factors that could affect future results historically high levels of volatility in revenue and cost trends our revenues and profitability from operations have historically varied our revenues cost of providing revenues profit margins and overhead expenses have varied historically among our online and media service components as well as on a consolidated basis the revenue derived from our online and media service components may likely be different in future fiscal periods due to several factors including consumer tastes business opportunities and regulatory issues that may exist in future periods therefore it is difficult to predict revenue and gross margin trends and their corresponding impact on liquidity and capital resources actual trends may cause us to adjust our operating emphasis which could result in continued period to period fluctuations in our results of operations historically we have been able to rapidly react to changes in the business environment within which we operate management responds to these changes as deemed appropriate at the time of change and as dictated by the nature of such changes managements reaction to such changes could cover a broad range of business related adjustments ranging from product mix repositioning and staff reductions to entire business model overhauls based on our current operations and marketing methods as well as the dynamic ever changing status of the internet marketing environment it is conceivable that we would institute changes to our business practices in future fiscal periods there can be no assurance that any such potential change would be successful in its implementation and there can be no assurance that any such implementation would benefit our operating margins profitability cash flows or capital resources revenue recognition variable costs and bad debts we currently earn our revenue from our online and media service activities pursuant to marketing agreements with our marketing partners and corporate customers the provisions of each agreement determine the type and timing of revenue to be recorded we invoice our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement revenue is recognized at the time the marketing activity is delivered or service is provided net of an estimated sales allowance when applicable such sales allowance may include an estimate for duplications invalid addresses and or age restrictions that are due from but have not yet been reported to us by our customers these sales allowances are recorded as contra revenue our revenues are adjusted in later fiscal periods if actual sales allowances vary from amounts previously estimated historically the variance between actual sales allowances and previously estimated sales allowances has been immaterial if events were to occur that would cause actual sales allowances which are recorded as offsets against gross revenue as contra revenues in arriving at reported net revenue to vary significantly from those originally estimated and reflected in the financial statements we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins and therefore our profitability cash flows and capital resources could be adversely affected certain revenue related obligations are recorded at the time revenue is recognized they include costs payable to other online as well as off line media companies for generating registered users and consumer data for us database fee sharing costs under third party database use agreements email message delivery costs contingent based prize indemnification coverage ie sweepstakes payout indemnification estimated premium fulfillment costs related to the respective promotion when and if applicable and all other variable costs directly associated with completing our obligations relative to the revenue being recognized when our estimates vary from that which was originally accrued the associated variance is deemed a change in managements estimate and accordingly we take the increase or decrease to sales costs or overhead in the fiscal period that the variance is determinable should the internet operating landscape change resulting in a higher costs of acquiring consumer data and registered users for our websites b higher costs of acquiring data for our marketing partners compromising such marketing partners ability to maintain adequate sized databases to allow for continued third party database use agreements c the infiknowledge asset acquisition failing to maintain a lower cost of our email delivery activities and web development and web hosting service costs as compared to our competitors or us being required to depend on third party emailing service bureaus to a degree higher and or at a cost in excess of our anticipated internally generated costs d our contingent based prize indemnification premiums for indemnification coverage increasing due to an increase in the number of prize winners at the sites or e unpredictable technology changes or commercial technology applications then if any one or a combination of the above factors were to materialize we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period revenue growth and gross margins and therefore our profitability cash flows and capital resources could be materially adversely affected revenue recognition is also subject to provisions based on the probability of collection of the related trade accounts receivable we continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results financial condition or bankruptcy filings of our customers as a result of this review process we record bad debt provisions to adjust the related receivables carrying amount to an estimated realizable value provisions for bad debts are also recorded due to the review of other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due historical experience and other factors obtained during the conduct of collection efforts if circumstances change regarding our specific customers on an individual basis or if demand for internet direct marketing softens or if the us economy stumbles our estimates for bad debt provisions could be further increased which could adversely affect our operating margins profitability cash flows and capital resources impairment of goodwill other intangibles and investment portfolio could impact net income we carry goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet arising from current and prior year acquisitions we are required to review at least annually goodwill for any asset impairment if the review of the goodwill related to the subsidiaries organized to acquire such assets determines that such goodwill is impaired then we will be required to recognize an impairment charge on such goodwill necessary to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its net realizable value should events occur that would give rise to such impairment charge we would recognize decreased profitability to the extent of such adjustment cash flows would not be directly affected by the impairment charge but cash flows would most likely be adversely affected as a result of the facts and circumstances that created the impairment charge as of november we performed our annual review of goodwill and determined there to be no impairment and have not recognized any events through the date of this report that would negatively impact goodwill market fluctuation and debt repayment risk of marketable securities investment portfolio we maintain an investment portfolio that is managed by prominent financial institutions the portfolio includes high grade corporate commercial paper and auction rate securities and common stock equities all of which are held for varying periods of time pursuant to maturity dates market conditions and other factors the fair value of our investments in the common stock of publicly traded companies as of november amounted to approximately million these investments are subject to market price volatility in addition to the potential for business failure at the company level moreover due to the potential for an economic downturn and the potential of related fiscal difficulties that may be faced by some of the companies in which we have investments our investment portfolio could become impaired by the failure of such companies to fulfill their responsibility of adhering to the repayment of principal upon maturity additionally our cash flows and interest income could be negatively impacted by federal reserve bank
