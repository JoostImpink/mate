government intelligence and defense customers our solutions include advanced signal processing image processing information processing information assurance and engineering innovations we create our solutions by integrating our services and expertise with hardware software and our proprietary and patented technology to meet our customers requirements we have expanded our capabilities customer set and technologies through the integration of several strategic acquisitions our ability to directly integrate essential technologies into innovative solutions is an important differentiator for essex with its customers during the first quarter of we completed our acquisition of the annapolis maryland based windermere the windermere acquisition adds breadth and depth to essexs existing technical capabilities and to its intelligence community customer set in addition windermere adds information assurance and engineering innovations to the range of intelligence technologies we offer our awards with the us government generally extend over multiple years most of our contracts are classified within the intelligence and defense communities we have established and maintained long standing and successful customer relationships we are also developing next generation signal image and information processing information assurance and engineering innovations solutions under classified us government research and development contracts we have been able to develop our current proprietary technology using a combination of government funding and our own internal funding and we believe this combination should allow us to continue to enhance and expand our technology and services for future market needs essex is also expanding its ability to create products from its technologies for both government and commercial applications table of contents while we have primarily marketed our services and products to the intelligence and defense markets we believe we are also well positioned to apply our solutions to growth areas within the commercial market historically our proprietary technology and products although critical to our solutions offerings have not accounted for a significant portion of our revenues on a stand alone basis most of our revenues are derived from awards with the us government where we are either the prime contractor or a subcontractor depending on the award for fiscal years ended december and december revenues derived from the us government programs were million or and million or of our total revenues respectively for fiscal year ended december revenues from our largest customer were million or of the companys revenues on certain projects our customers require us to purchase and provide the materials portion which may include hardware software and firmware of the total system solution which entails our purchasing materials from third party vendors and reselling it to our customers we show revenues and costs from purchased materials separately since these revenues carry significantly lower margins than our products and services revenues the purchased materials revenues are highly variable from period to period our most significant expenses are cost of goods sold and services provided which consist primarily of direct labor and associated costs for program personnel and direct expenses incurred to complete projects including the cost of materials and equipment and amounts paid or accrued to subcontractors our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements salaries and other costs as well as to manage personnel levels and utilize our personnel versus subcontracting the work can have a significant impact on our cost of goods sold and services provided utilizing our own employees on projects results in higher gross margins compared to utilizing subcontracted employees for the same work as a result we seek to maximize our internal labor content on our awards selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our management facilities finance and administrative groups and business development expenses which include bid and proposal efforts and occupancy travel and other corporate costs we have revenues from some awards on which our us government customers pay us to perform research and development on their behalf we also spend funds on internal research and development which are separately classified as such in the financial statements prior to the fourth quarter of the company had a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset as it had a history of net operating losses based on current and expected future operating results the company reversed substantially all of its valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of as a result the company expects to accrue income tax at approximately the statutory effective rate reduced by any estimated research and development credit in future periods the company has engaged an outside consultant to study its methodology for determining research and development credit eligible costs the effect if any of a change in methodology will be reflected in its tax provision on april we acquired of the common stock of computer science innovations inc or csi which is headquartered in melbourne florida for approximately million in cash csi has proprietary techniques algorithms and tools that are used to build custom cognitive engines for a broad range of intelligence defense and commercial customers and applications cognitive engines are software that includes predictive models and classifiers and our applications include the areas of fraud and anomaly detection image and signal recognition information integration knowledge management network information assurance semantic processing and waveform analysis csi had revenues of approximately million in its fiscal year ended march the last full year prior to acquisition on june we acquired substantially all of the assets of performance group inc or pgi with main offices in fredericksburg virginia for approximately million in cash and in assumed liabilities pgi provides services and systems in the areas of geographic information systems or gis image processing and analysis spatial data development environmental consulting visualization and it solutions to government and private sector clients pgi had revenue of approximately million for calendar year ended the last full year prior to acquisition table of contents on february we acquired of the ownership and membership interests of windermere for a total initial purchase price of million including the initial payment of million and legal and other fees of million the acquisition agreement for the windermere transaction contains earn out provisions that may require us to make an additional purchase price payment on may to be calculated based on excess earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of windermere during the applicable earn out period under the windermere earn out arrangement the companys aggregate contingent earn out obligation may range from a low of zero dollars to a maximum of million in cash and associated fees depending upon the extent to which windermeres ebitda during the period march through february exceeds the ebitda target of million for such period established and defined in the acquisition agreement we are not yet able to determine the extent to which earn out amounts may become payable under this agreement we expect to enter into discussions with the windermere sellers regarding the earn out by the end of the first quarter of pursuant to an oral agreement between stephen e tate who became an executive vice president of essex upon the windermere acquisition and essex essex paid stephen e tate a million finders fee in connection with the windermere acquisition to the extent any earn out is payable to the sellers in connection with the acquisition of windermere the company will be obligated to pay stephen e tate an additional fee equal to multiplied by such earn out amount up to a maximum an additional finders fee is also due to an individual who is neither affiliated with nor employed by essex to the extent significant earn out amounts become payable we expect to pay such amounts from cash balances then existing and if such cash balances are not sufficient to fund the payments we will likely fund the payments through borrowings under our credit facility or sales of common stock under our shelf registration or both windermere provides engineering innovations information assurance and information technology solutions primarily to government agencies and the intelligence community windermere had revenues of million including million of revenue from discontinued operations for the calendar year ended december as disclosed in our quarterly reports on form q for the three month periods ended march june and september we identified certain material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting of our recently acquired windermere subsidiary those weaknesses which we believe are not unusual for a privately held company of the size of windermere included a lack of segregation of duties of financial personnel and inadequate financial management systems in light of those weaknesses in an effort to remediate and integrate windermeres internal controls we made certain organizational and personnel changes in the period ended december these included altering the organizational structure of windermere evaluating and planning training programs for financial management personnel hiring new financial personnel and changing reporting structures in a manner designed to provide more direct reporting from windermere financial personnel to essex financial personnel we believe these have resulted in an overall improvement in the internal controls over financial reporting for windermere we also believe additional remediation is necessary for instance budgetary analysis and processes at windermere require further strengthening and refinement to be better integrated with and to be brought up to overall industry standards to which we adhere in february we implemented a new general ledger and budgetary system company wide we expect additional improvements in windermeres internal controls over financial reporting will be made as the financial personnel training programs progress and financial policies and procedures are adopted company wide we expect that these measures will be implemented in the first and second quarters of fiscal in addition we undertook additional review procedures to assure that the financial statements for the three and twelve month periods ended december are in accordance with us gaap during the second quarter of we created the commercial communications products division ccpd to develop and sell fiber optic modules and subsystems for advanced communications applications to both commercial and government markets ccpd designs manufactures integrates and tests our communication products which include the km and extended range xfp transceivers duobinary pin msa transponders and microwave transceiver assemblies mta production of the mta began in december and subject to the results of testing and certification availability of production units for the xfp transceivers table of contents and duobinary transponders is planned for early in the third quarter of in less than of our total revenues were derived from ccpd while the initial ccpd operating costs and the research and development investment impacted our earnings we expect an improvement in as the product orders are completed ccpd operates within the commercial products group organization of essex which has the charter to create innovative solutions to satisfy customer and market needs to evaluate and select innovations for productization and to manage the productization marketing and sales of essex products to both commercial and government customers at commercial product rates critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition research and development intangible assets and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates are used when accounting for uncollectible accounts receivable depreciation and amortization intangible assets goodwill and employee benefit plans and contingencies among others actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we enter into the following types of us government agreements time and material on time and material agreements revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates multiplied by hours delivered plus other direct costs cost plus fee we recognize revenue on cost plus fee arrangements to the extent costs are incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned we must determine that the costs incurred are proper and that the ultimate costs incurred will not overrun the expected funding on the project and still deliver the scope of work proposed even though cost plus fee arrangements generally do not require that we expend costs in excess of the award value such expenditures may be required in order to achieve customer satisfaction and receive additional work in addition since the reimbursable costs include both direct and indirect costs we must determine that the indirect costs are properly accounted for and allocated in accordance with reasonable cost allocation methods fixed price on fixed price agreements we must determine that the costs incurred provide a proportionate amount of progress on the work and that the ultimate costs incurred will not overrun the funding on the award for the required services or product to be delivered award or incentive fees may be received in lieu of or in addition to other fees on time and material or cost plus fee contracts where award or incentive fees are applicable we record as revenues an estimate of the expected award or incentive fee proportionate to the work performed estimated fee is based on our experience under the contract or similar contracts and on on going communication with the client regarding performance table of contents we use historical technical performance experience where applicable to evaluate progress on fixed price and cost plus fee jobs we use historical government audit experience in the indirect cost area to evaluate the propriety and expected recovery of our indirect costs on cost plus fee agreements the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues under each type of contract for the fiscal years ended december december and december percentage of revenues bycontract type fiscal year ended dec dec dec time and material cost plus fixed fee cost plus incentive fee fixed price total the change for the fiscal year ended december to december is principally attributable to the contract mix of the revenue associated with the windermere acquisition which was more heavily weighted toward cost plus contracts costs of goods sold and services provided our costs are categorized as either direct or indirect costs direct costs are those that can be identified with and allocated to specific contracts and tasks they include labor fringe for example leave time medicaldental retirement plan payroll taxes employee welfare workers compensation and other benefits subcontractor costs consultant fees travel expenses materials and equipment indirect costs are either overhead or general and administrative expenses indirect costs cannot generally be identified with specific contracts or tasks and to the extent that they are allowable they are allocated to contracts and tasks using appropriate government approved methodologies costs determined to be unallowable under the federal acquisition regulations cannot be allocated to projects our principal unallowable costs are interest expense amortization expense for separately identified intangibles from acquisitions certain general and administrative expenses financing and mergeracquisition costs research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred such costs include direct labor and materials as well as a reasonable allocation of overhead costs however no general and administrative costs are included equipment which has alternative future uses is capitalized and charged to expense over its estimated useful life goodwill and other intangible assets business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in a combination with contracts or assets we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no which requires that we on an annual basis calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status managements judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units because of the integral technologies and operations of the acquisitions to date we have determined that essex has only one corporate wide reporting entity to which this test applies intangibles are amortized over their estimated life not exceeding five years table of contents stock options in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no r share based payment which is a revision of sfas no accounting for stock issued to employees sfas no r requires that all share based payments to employees including grants of employee stock options be valued at fair value on the grant date and be expensed over the applicable vesting period sfas no r is effective for the company on january the company will transition to sfas no r using the modified prospective application under the modified prospective application compensation costs will be recognized in the financial statements for all new share based payments granted after january additionally the company will recognize compensation costs for the portion of previously granted awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered nonvested awards that are outstanding as of january over the remaining requisite service period of the awards the compensation expense to be recognized for the nonvested awards will be based on the fair value of the awards our adoption of sfas no r will adversely affect our financial position and results of operations in future periods at december the total value of options outstanding and vesting after january is expected to be approximately with before the consideration of income taxes if any vesting in the year ending december income taxes until the fourth quarter of the company was providing a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets based upon a review of a number of factors including the companys recent historical operating performance and its expectation that it can generate consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future the company reversed in the fourth quarter of substantially all or approximately million of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets as a result of the valuation allowance reversal the company recognized a non cash tax benefit of million as part of the deferred income tax provision also as a result of the valuation allowance reversal the company recognized a non cash tax benefit of million as an increase in additional paid in capital to reflect the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation and was recognized as a reduction to goodwill for net deferred tax assets from acquisitions in prior years furthermore the company expects to accrue income tax at approximately the statutory effective rate reduced by any estimated research and development credit in future periods the company recorded an income tax provision of and for and respectively as stated above the deferred tax provision is net of a million beneficial change in valuation allowance we recorded a current provision for state income taxes of in the year ended december for state and local income taxes where net operating loss carryforwards are not available to offset current taxable income we also recorded a current provision for federal income taxes of in the year ended december for alternative minimum tax amt due to the limitation under the amt rules on the use of net operating loss carryforwards the provision relates entirely to current state income tax in jurisdictions where the company did not have net operating loss carryforwards offset by valuation allowance business combination we apply the provisions of sfas no business combinations whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgment that may be adjusted during the allocation period but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date external costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations while internal costs incurred by us for acquisition opportunities are expensed table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with or through any unconsolidated entity or which have not been recognized and disclosed in these financial statements results of operations the following table sets forth for each period indicated the percentage of items in the statement of operations in relation to revenue fiscal year ended dec dec dec revenues services and products purchased materials total costs of goods sold and services provided gross margin selling general and administrative expenses research and development expenses amortization of other intangible assets operating income interestdividend income expense net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth for each component of our revenues the related gross margin provided expressed as a percentage of the related revenues for the periods indicated dec dec dec gross margin by revenue type services and products purchased materials had no comparable purchases to and fiscal year ended december compared to the fiscal year ended december revenues our revenues were million and million in fiscal and respectively revenues increased as a result of both acquisition and internal growth with regard to acquisition revenues revenues include ten months of results from windermere in the last full year of operations prior to the acquisition windermere reported million less million from a unit that was not acquired the internal growth results primarily from our thunder contract and growth on the woodstock contract that exceeded historical performance levels occurring prior to acquisition we expect our revenues in to continue to be primarily from us government contracts revenue from material purchases increased by million revenue from purchased materials declined as a percentage of total revenue from of the total in fiscal to in fiscal as we have previously discussed purchased materials are hardware software and firmware acquired as part of our total solution table of contents offering to our clients purchased material can fluctuate significantly from period to period and generally carry a very low margin costs of goods sold and services provided cgs total cgs increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of increased revenues volume at improved gross margins as a percentage of total revenues total cgs was approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal for services and products revenue cgs was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the improved margins are primarily a result of better margins on our thunder contract as we continued to increase the number of essex personnel instead of lower margin subcontract personnel working on the job and as we began performing the contract in our essex facility we anticipate that the gradual shift of this work to our personnel to continue over time in addition services and products margins from contracts acquired through the windermere acquisition exceeded the margins further contributing to the improvement furthermore margins improved on our purchased materials as a result of certain contractual changes and our acquisition of windermere which has contracts with higher margins for such materials selling general and administrative expenses sga selling general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sga costs have increased as the volume of business has increased through internal and acquisition growth sga increased as a percentage of revenues from of revenues in to of revenues for due to the increase in facilities costs to support general corporate needs as well as the expansion of our facilities under our thunder contract increased business development costs and additional labor and infrastructure costs to support our growth as well as costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance research and development expenses rd research and development expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the increase primarily reflects continued investment in our cognitive systems and in our optical communications and signal processing technologies this includes our optical encryptor as well as communications technologies of our recently formed commercial communication products division amortization of other intangible assets during fiscal amortization of other intangible assets was million compared to in fiscal this increase resulted from the amortization of customer contracts receivables and other intangibles associated with the windermere acquisition that occurred in february amortization of existing intangibles is expected to decline to approximately million in fiscal net interestdividend income expense net interestdividend income was million in fiscal compared to net interestdividend income of in fiscal the increase in net interestdividend income reflects the temporary investment of the proceeds from our stock offering as well as in interest on a million loan to windermere prior to its purchase by essex net income net income was million and million in fiscal and respectively the company recorded an income tax provision of and for and respectively the deferred tax provision is net of a million beneficial change in valuation allowance the company continues to have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset current federal and state income tax we recognized a provision for current federal income taxes of in and current state income taxes of and in and respectively where our net operating loss is limited or not available or where we are subject to the alternative minimum tax the company expects to accrue income tax at approximately the statutory effective rate reduced by any estimated research and development credit in future periods fiscal year ended december compared to the fiscal year ended december revenues our revenues were million and million in fiscal and respectively the key factors for the higher revenues were the increased activity on our thunder contract award and a january table of contents million increased in the third quarter of to million two year award for software and systems engineering and the delivery of custom systems to national priority programs revenues from these two awards in fiscal were million and million respectively of this total of million million was for purchased materials there was no comparable purchased material in costs of goods sold and services provided cgs total cgs increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues total cgs was approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal for services and products revenue cgs was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in cgs in reflects increased volume and revenues for the period the increase in cgs as a percentage of revenues in reflects the change in the mix of work primarily related to the two contracts discussed under revenues immediately above specifically upon award and ramp up a majority of the revenues under those contracts relate to subcontracts and purchased materials which are at a lower margin for purchased materials revenues cgs was in fiscal and there were no comparable purchases in fiscal selling general and administrative expenses sga selling general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sga costs have increased as the volume of business has increased through internal and acquisition growth sga decreased as a percentage of revenues from of revenues in to of revenues for research and development expenses rd research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from in fiscal we incurred the majority of our research and development on efforts related to optical communications technology and have incurred rd since may in the newly acquired csi operation amortization of other intangible assets during fiscal amortization of other intangible assets was which was primarily related to the csi and pgi acquisitions there was of amortization costs in the comparable period in relating to the sdl acquisition the remaining balance of of other intangible assets was fully amortized during the first and second quarters of we had no amortization cost in fiscal net interestdividend income expense net interestdividend income was in fiscal compared to net interestdividend expense of in the comparable period of the net interestdividend income reflects the temporary investment of the proceeds from our and stock offerings net income net income was million and in fiscal and respectively we were in a net operating loss carry forward position for book and tax purposes and maintained a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets we recognized a current provision for state income taxes in of where our net operating loss was not available backlog our awards with the us government generally extend over multiple years funded backlog generally consists of the sum of all awarded amounts of work for which funding has been approved and awards granted less the value of work performed under such awards since the us government operates under annual appropriations our customers typically fund awards on an incremental basis generally for periods of one year or less in many cases our awards include unexercised options accordingly a significant amount of our backlog is unfunded we include in unfunded backlog the total value of signed contracts less funding to date unfunded backlog includes awarded options based upon expected performance levels for those options unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential delivery orders that might be awarded under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts beyond the current level of effort being performed under those contracts as of december we had total backlog funded and unfunded of million as compared with million at december of these amounts funded backlog was million and unfunded table of contents backlog was million at fiscal year end december compared to million and million respectively at fiscal year end unfunded backlog at december includes the remaining balance of million on our thunder contract at december unfunded backlog on this contract was million unfunded backlog at december also includes the remaining balance of million on our woodstock contract in addition to priced options through september the woodstock contract includes an annual option to double the value of each annual contract option the customer exercised and funded that option in and based on the tasks proposed to date we expect that the customer will continue to exercise that doubling option as a result we include these options through the contract period in unfunded backlog unfunded backlog at december also includes million from of our million cougar contract awarded in december both windermere and essex are subcontractors on a single contract referred to as jackhammer to provide communication systems support to the intelligence community through the total contract value of both subcontracts is million which includes a recent increase of million the total unfunded backlog for both subcontracts at december was million unfunded backlog for the essex subcontract was million at december our total backlog has increased significantly during from million at december to million at december primarily due to the contracts acquired in the windermere acquisition the award of the cougar contract and growth in our woodstock contract we currently expect to recognize revenue during fiscal year from approximately of our total backlog as of december there can be no assurance that we will receive amounts included in our backlog or that monies will be appropriated by congress or otherwise made available to finance contracts and task orders included in our backlog many factors that affect the scheduling of projects could alter the actual timing of revenue on projects included in backlog there is always the possibility that the contracts could be adjusted or cancelled we adjust our backlog on a quarterly basis to reflect modifications to or renewals of existing contracts awards of new contracts or approvals of expenditures net operating loss carry forward the companys net deferred tax asset at december includes federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of its net deferred tax asset based upon a review of a number of factors including the companys recent historical operating performance and its expectation that it can generate consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future as a result the company reversed substantially all of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets including its nol in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance the costs of our operations and to make capital expenditures and acquisitions a significant part of our business strategy is to pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions and we used a substantial portion of our cash balance at fiscal year end for the acquisition of windermere the acquisition agreement for the windermere transaction contains earn out provisions that may require us to make an additional purchase price payment on may to be calculated based on excess earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of windermere during the applicable earn out period under the windermere earn out arrangement the companys aggregate contingent earn out obligation may range from a low of zero dollars to a maximum of million in cash and associated fees depending upon the extent to which windermeres ebitda during the period march through february exceeds the ebitda target of million for such period established and defined in the acquisition agreement we are not table of contents yet able to determine the extent to which earn out amounts may become payable under this agreement we expect to enter into discussions with the windermere sellers regarding the earn out by the end of the first quarter of pursuant to an oral agreement between stephen e tate who became an executive vice president of essex upon the windermere acquisition and essex essex paid stephen e tate a million finders fee in connection with the windermere acquisition to the extent any earn out is payable to the sellers in connection with the acquisition of windermere the company will be obligated to pay stephen e tate an additional fee equal to multiplied by such earn out amount up to a maximum an additional finders fee is also due to an individual who is neither affiliated with nor employed by essex if amounts become payable under the earn out arrangement or if additional amounts become payable under the finders fee arrangements described above appropriate increases will be made to goodwill associated with the acquisition for fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities was million a significant improvement from where cash provided by operating activities was million and where cash used in operations was cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was from net income and non cash depreciation amortization and other charges of approximately million offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accounts payable net of the change in other liabilities of million accounts receivable increased during fiscal year primarily due to ramp up on acquired contracts subcontractor accruals and award fees to be billed in we anticipate that contractual and process improvements will reduce our days sales outstanding in our receivables improving our cash position as the year progresses for fiscal year net cash used in investing activities was million of which million net of cash acquired in the acquisition was for the acquisition of windermere we also expended million for property equipment and leasehold improvements to support our growing work force our working capital at december decreased to million from million at fiscal year end the decrease was primarily a result of the acquisition of windermere for cash we anticipate continued investment in infrastructure in as we continue to support our growing workforce and as we expand our facilities to support our thunder woodstock and cougar contracts for fiscal year net cash used in financing activities was million which primarily represented the cash pay down of the acquired windermere line of credit to reduce interest expense offset by increased stock option exercises on july the securities and exchange commission declared effective our equity shelf registration statement on form s relating to one or more future offerings of up to an aggregate of million of our common stock we believe the shelf registration statement will provide us with more efficient and immediate access to capital markets when considered appropriate our board of directors has authorized management to pursue an underwritten public offering of up to million in our common stock under the shelf registration statement as of march we have not issued any securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement on june the company and its subsidiaries entered into the credit facility with bank of america na the companys obligations under the credit facility are secured by all assets of the company and its subsidiaries except patents and have a maturity date of june under the credit facility the bank has committed subject to customary conditions precedent to provide advances and letters of credit of up to million with guidance line advances of up to an additional million at the banks discretion the credit facility contains certain financial covenants with which the company was in compliance as of march there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility as of march the company expects to satisfy its operating cash requirements for from its projected positive operating cash flows and existing cash balance to the extent that future acquisitions capital requirements or table of contents any potential earn out payment under the windermere purchase agreement and related finders fee obligations require cash beyond our expected positive cash flows and existing cash balance over the next twelve months the company may utilize its credit facility with the bank or proceeds from the offering under the shelf registration if consummated or both there can be no assurance that the company will or based on market factors or business activities that the company will be able to issue shares under the shelf registration statement or otherwise obtain financing on terms favorable to us if at all inflation because of the companys substantial activities in professional services and product development the company is more labor intensive than firms involved primarily in industrial activities to attract and maintain higher caliber professional staff the company must structure its compensation programs competitively the wage demand effect of inflation is felt almost immediately in the companys costs however the net effect during the periods presented is minimal first the inflation rate in the united states generally has little impact on the companys cost reimbursable type contracts and other short term contracts second for longer term fixed price and time and material type contracts the company endeavors to protect its margins by including cost escalation provisions or other specific inflation protective terms in these contracts contractual obligations and commitments contractual cash obligations our contractual cash obligations increased to million at december from million at december due principally to windermere operating leases acquired as part of the acquisition of windermere on february net of payments made during the twelve month period ended december the following table shows for each period indicated our contractual obligations we have no contractual cash obligations due after in thousands operating leases capital leases including interest total the company entered into leases for production and office space in maryland in connection with the work on its largest program the leases are for seven years ending approximately april and total rent is approximately million the leases contain normal clauses for payment of operating real estate and common area maintenance over base year amounts and provide for a one time option to terminate the leases after years from the commencement date of the respective lease in february we signed a lease to expand this facility by approximately square feet in connection with these leases the company provided approximately million to the landlord to finance special security related leasehold improvements the company has recorded a note receivable in connection with the lease as the landlord is repaying the funds over months at interest prior to our acquisition of windermere windermere leased certain office facilities from an entity in which certain members of the sellers had significant interests as part of the acquisition agreement essex leased the facility from an entity in which a current non executive employee has an ownership interest in addition stephen e tate an executive vice president of essex is the son of raymond t tate who until december was the executive vice president and general manager of windermere is the brother of three of the members of the entity but does not have a direct ownership interest in the entity the lease is for square feet and runs through february the annual rent is approximately through and table of contents in in the company paid approximately for the months of occupancy since acquisition the total rent obligation is approximately million and is included in our contractual cash obligations the company has several other office facilities under long term leases which expire in the leases contain provisions to pay for proportionate increases in operating costs and property taxes in addition facilities leases often include a provision to remove at the option of the landlord any security related leasehold improvements because the company currently considers such an option
