item a of this form k the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with an understanding of our recent performance our financial condition and our prospects the following will be discussed and analyzed operations chief executive officers summary recent developments industry trends critical accounting policies and estimates recent accounting pronouncements results of operations liquidity and capital resources other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources outlook forward looking statements operations we are a multinational diversified producer of premium specialty papers and the worlds largest supplier of fine papers to the tobacco industry we are the premier manufacturer of high porosity papers which are used in manufacturing ventilated cigarettes and the leading independent producer of rtl used in producing blended cigarettes we conduct business in over countries and currently operate production locations worldwide with mills in the united states france the philippines indonesia brazil and canada we manufacture and sell paper and reconstituted tobacco products to the tobacco industry as well as specialized paper products for use in other applications tobacco industry products which comprised approximately percent of our net sales for each of the years through include cigarette papers rtl for use as filler in cigarettes reconstituted tobacco wrappers and binders for cigars and paper products used in cigarette packaging commercial and industrial products include lightweight printing and writing papers coated papers for packaging and labeling applications business forms battery separator paper drinking straw wrap filter papers and other specialized papers primarily for the north american western european and brazilian markets we maintain an internet web site address at wwwschweitzer mauduitcom the web site provides additional background information including further information on our history products and locations chief executive officers summary financial results our net sales totaled million a percent reduction compared to the decline was related to changes in sales volumes which decreased net sales by million primarily due to lower sales volumes in france compared to total sales volumes decreased by percent sales volumes decreased by percent for the french businesses and declined by percent in the us business unit reflecting primarily the dcor papers exit and a reduction in fill business brazilian business unit sales volumes increased by percent due to increased commercial and industrial as well as tobacco related paper sales in part reflecting our strategy to shift production of certain grades from the united states to brazil operating profit was million a million decrease from excluding million in restructuring charges operating profit declined by million or percent reductions in mill operating schedules due to decreased production volumes as a result of lower sales volumes and downtime taken to reduce finished product inventories carried over from caused lower absorption of mill fixed costs and negatively impacted operating profit by million inflationary cost increases decreased profitability by million primarily due to higher energy and wood pulp expenses the income tax benefit of million resulted from reduced income impacted by restructuring expenses changes in the geographic mix of taxable earnings of our businesses and the favorable tax impact of our foreign holding company structure minority interest decreased by million because of reduced profitability at ltri the net loss was million compared to net income of million in diluted loss per share was compared to diluted earnings per share of in following our disappointing financial results in we expect to make progress during in mitigating the continuing impact of inflationary cost increases and reduced production schedules that have decreased our earnings over the last years we intend to do this through improved worldwide mill operations the benefits in france and the united states from previously announced restructuring activities and the continued growth and cost improvement in producing cigarette paper for lip cigarettes as well as rtl products strategic initiatives we are now implementing a plan to become a low cost and the highest quality cigarette and long fiber paper manufacturer in western europe this plan includes a workforce and papermaking restructuring at our largest french paper operation papeteries de mauduit pdm to lower operating costs the unions works council and management concluded negotiations reaching agreement on terms and conditions of a workforce reduction of employees and the shutdown of cigarette paper machines during capital investments of million in state of the art automated equipment and removal of higher cost production equipment specifically we are rebuilding of large cigarette paper machines and installing robotized high speed converting units at pdm the capital investments will be completed in the fourth quarter of and the workforce reduction is expected to be accomplished in phases in and also announced during the year was a decision to cease production and sale of dcor papers made at our mill in lee massachusetts with this decision the operation of paper machine was terminated and a plan was developed to restructure the operation of the mill including the implementation of a team based work system in restructuring expenses in france related to negotiated future cash severance payments and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets totaled million restructuring expenses in the united states totaled million primarily related to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets and employee severance costs opportunities and challenges a number of current projects were undertaken to reduce costs or increase sales and earnings we are confident in our strategies for restructuring our french and us operations to better balance capacity with available demand and reduce costs we are expecting modest improved earnings from the restructuring activities in and substantial improvements in and beyond sales growth is planned for cigarette paper used in the production of lip cigarettes in lip cigarettes accounted for about percent of cigarettes sold in north america by mid year cigarette paper sales for lip cigarettes are expected to grow to approximately percent of north american cigarette paper sales volume sales growth is planned in reconstituted tobacco products with increased volume in rtl during and and an improved operating schedule in versus additional specific cost reduction activities are planned across all business units the benefits are expected to further offset the continuing unfavorable impacts of lower production volumes and inflationary cost increases that were experienced during and in the fourth quarter of we will start up a rebuilt paper machine in brazil that will manufacture world class quality and low cost base tipping paper this project is expected to contribute to increased sales and earnings in the construction of our joint venture with the china state tobacco monopoly administration a machine mill in jiangmen china to manufacture cigarette paper and long fiber tobacco papers is on schedule to start up in the first half of several initiatives are being pursued to expand our manufacturing presence in asia discussions are progressing toward an agreement to form a joint venture in china to manufacture rtl for cigarettes recent developments philip morris supply agreement on december we provided a notice of non renewal of the ssa with philip morris usa and while we intend to negotiate a new supply arrangement with philip morris usa the outcome of any such discussions is not presently known additional information regarding the ssa with philip morris usa is included in markets and customers in part i item and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements operational changes france and united states we initiated restructuring activities during which are expected to improve our competitiveness and profitability as well as address an imbalance between sales demand for our products and our paper production capacity in france and the united states the following table summarizes the associated cash and non cash pretax restructuring expense totaling million for dollars in millions france us total cash expense severance and other employee related costs other total cash expense non cash expense accelerated depreciation other total non cash expense total restructuring expense at the lee mills facility in massachusetts restructuring activities were initiated in that have become part of an overall effort to sustain profitable operations at this location actions at the lee mills were prompted in part by a notification from kimberly clark corporation to terminate an agreement for the operation of a paper machine at this site while the current term of the contract was scheduled to expire in december kimberly clark gave notice of early termination on january which under the contract began an month termination period for the contract this termination notice was modified in october and extended the termination period to not earlier than december while certain of the costs associated with operation of this machine that are currently invoiced to kimberly clark can be eliminated we may be unable to eliminate a portion of the approximately million of annual indirect and fixed overhead costs that are currently absorbed by that operation when the kimberly clark contract expires as a result of the kimberly clark notice as well as changes in tobacco related paper customer sales volume forecasts and lack of profitability for certain commercial and industrial paper grades produced at the lee mills we decided in february to transfer production volume from porous plug wrap paper machine to another under utilized lee mills porous plug wrap paper machine and to commence accelerated depreciation on the affected equipment additionally the salaried and hourly lee mills workforces were reorganized to be more efficient and cost effective which resulted in the loss of approximately jobs additionally during may we announced a decision to cease the production and sale of dcor papers made at the lee mills as a result of this decision we ceased operation of a paper machine in july which resulted in accelerated depreciation and other restructuring expense this cessation resulted in the loss of approximately jobs in total at the lee mills and at our us headquarters in alpharetta georgia as a result of these decisions we recorded million of restructuring expense in the united states in in france a decrease in the consumption of cigarettes primarily caused by increased consumer taxes and regulations on the cigarette industry impacted the demand for some of our tobacco related products in western europe and elsewhere also new tobacco related papers manufacturing capacity was added in and by competitors in europe that increased competition in a period of reduced demand the reduced demand for our products has caused us to have continuing excess capacity and increased machine downtime in france on september we announced plans to invest approximately million to improve the cost and quality competitiveness in our paper operations at pdm as well as initiation of negotiations with the unions and the works council to consider restructuring operations at that facility including employee layoffs and the shutdown of production equipment on october the first meeting among pdm management unions and the works council occurred at this meeting further detail information was provided regarding the costs timing and benefits of the strategy to become a low cost and the highest quality cigarette and long fiber paper manufacturer in western europe the elements of this strategy at pdm include i improvement of cigarette paper manufacturing by investing in more automated capabilities while removing older higher cost production equipment ii reduction in general mill operating costs iii development of an improved commercial policy intended to grow market share iv renewed efforts to further develop the long fiber paper business using pdms existing papermaking capacity and v the restructuring of work practices to enhance the productivity and organizational effectiveness of pdms human resources on december the unions works council and management of pdm concluded negotiations and successfully reached an agreement regarding the terms and conditions of the workforce reductions associated with the planned restructuring at the site in quimperl france the terms of the severance agreement and other related costs are expected to result in cash expenditures of approximately to million through the actual amount of severance expenses will be dependent upon the final number of individuals within each of the possible categories for employee severance that include early retirement other voluntary means and involuntary layoffs in the final agreement workforce levels will be reduced by employees in essentially equal phases during each of and the first phase is associated with reduced machine operating schedules and other organizational changes the second phase reflects expected employment reductions following capital investments the pdm restructuring plan is expected to result in the shutdown of cigarette paper machines during overall pdm restructuring expenses are now projected to be in the range of to million for through including the above cash costs and approximately million for non cash accelerated depreciation of fixed assets we recognized million in restructuring expense in france during the remainder of the total projected restructuring expenses will be recognized during and financing of the approximately to million total cash capital investment and severance and related expenses is expected to be fully funded through internally generated funds and our existing bank credit facility severance cash payments are expected to total approximately million during no severance payments were made in a pdm severance liability of million was recorded in the third quarter of for the minimum severance liability mandated by french law in accordance with sfas no employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no and we expect to recognize an additional severance obligation above the french minimum of million as a result of the union agreement reached on december in accordance with sfas no accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities million of amortization for this additional severance obligation was recorded in the fourth quarter the additional severance obligation will continue to be accrued and amortized to restructuring expense ratably over the affected employees remaining service periods the remainder of this additional severance obligation will be recorded during and the amount of these severance obligations could change depending on the mix of employees that leave through early retirement or other voluntary terminations versus involuntary separation we continue to evaluate how to operate our worldwide production facilities more effectively analyses are ongoing and we have not committed to any actions beyond those identified above however additional restructuring actions may be taken based on the outcome of these analyses which could increase the amounts of restructuring expense already expected to be recorded in and lower ignition propensity cigarettes certain governmental entities particularly in north america have considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked to date us states and canada have passed such regulations additional information regarding lower ignition legislation is included in tobacco products and government actions in part i item a risk factors china joint venture in july we announced execution of an agreement to form a joint venture to produce tobacco related papers in china project spending including capital expenditures and working capital requirements is expected to total approximately million pdm is providing technical support and project management the project is advancing smoothly and on schedule with mill operations currently expected to commence as planned in the first half of we made our initial equity injections in the joint venture of million during and we expect to make additional equity investments of approximately million and million in and respectively additional information regarding the china joint venture is included in part i item properties new bank credit agreement we entered into a new bank credit agreement effective july which provides for a additional borrowing capacity of approximately million increasing the total facilities to approximately million from approximately million b a reduced number of tranches from to c extended terms with the maturity date of the new facilities being no earlier than years d lower interest rate margins and e fewer less restrictive financial covenant requirements the increased amount of the facility and its favorable terms provide greater flexibility to pursue various strategic opportunities industry trends consistent with recent historical trends worldwide cigarette consumption is expected to increase at a rate of approximately to percent per year the anticipated decline in the production of cigarettes in developed countries is expected to be more than offset by increased cigarette production in developing countries that currently represent approximately percent of worldwide cigarette production population demographics and expected increases in disposable income will support the increased consumption of cigarettes in developing countries in addition the litigation environment is different in most foreign countries compared with the united states having less of an impact on the pricing of cigarettes which in turn affects cigarette consumption cigarette production in the united states is expected to continue to decline as a result of reduced cigarette exports and a decline in domestic cigarette consumption caused by increased cigarette prices health concerns and public perceptions including restrictions on where smoking is allowed as well cigarette consumption has been declining in western europe following recent tax increases on cigarette sales and smoking restrictions the cigarette paper market in western europe has become more competitive with pressure on both sales volumes and selling prices caused by reduced cigarette consumption in several large european markets and new cigarette paper manufacturing capacity that was added in western europe in mid in developing countries there is a trend toward consumption of more sophisticated cigarettes which utilize higher quality tobacco related papers such as those we produce and rtl this trend toward more sophisticated cigarettes reflects increased governmental regulations concerning tar delivery levels and increased competition from multinational cigarette manufacturers based on these trends we expect worldwide demand for tobacco related papers and rtl products to continue to increase with a shift from developed countries to developing countries as a result we are increasing some of our production capacity in developing countries such as brazil the philippines and indonesia and we have entered into a joint venture in china critical accounting policies and estimates our accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies following are critical accounting matters which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and required managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments we discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the estimates and judgments made for each of these items and our accounting for and presentation of these items in the accompanying financial statements the accounting for these matters was based on current facts and circumstances which in our judgment hold potential for change which could affect our future estimates such that future financial results could differ materially from financial results based on managements current estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates arise in conjunction with the following income tax expense and accruals pension benefits expense and accruals litigation contingencies property plant and equipment valuation accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method income tax expense is recognized for both the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns we must make assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset our judgments assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate any of the assumptions judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations we record and maintain income tax valuation allowances as necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount which is estimated more likely than not to be realizable in accordance with financial accounting standards board or fasb statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no accounting for income taxes we have available net operating loss carryforwards excess foreign tax credit carryforwards alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and other various tax credits in the jurisdictions in which we operate for which we have recorded deferred tax assets totaling million as of december certain of these potential future benefits are not expected to be utilized in a manner beneficial to our financial results prior to their expiration as a result as of december we have million of valuation allowances against certain of the deferred tax assets as follows dollars in millions total valuation net asset allowance asset net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credit carryforwards federal research and us states tax credit carryforwards federal amt credit carryforwards under current tax laws governing jurisdictions in which we have net operating loss carryforwards or nols remaining nols in france and brazil carry forward indefinitely nols in the philippines expire years subsequent to the year generated and nols in spain expire years subsequent to the year generated we expect sufficient future taxable income in france and brazil to fully utilize the respective french and brazilian nols which carry forward indefinitely and for which no valuation allowances have been recorded as of december we also expect sufficient future taxable income in the philippines to fully utilize the philippine nols which carry forward for years and for which no valuation allowances have been recorded as of december the remaining nols at december in spain will fully expire in if not utilized against taxable income in spain valuation allowances related to nols in spain totaled million as of december fully reserving the related deferred tax asset in spain since we believe that it is reasonably likely that we will not generate taxable income in spain prior to the expiration of these nols as sm spain only functions as the primary foreign investment holding company for us we receive credits in our us federal income tax return for income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions income from foreign sources including dividend income paid from foreign subsidiaries is included in taxable income of the us parent in some cases the amount of credits realized in the tax return is more or less than the tax owed on the foreign source income when the amount of credits exceeds the amount of taxes owed on that foreign source income foreign tax credit carryforwards are generated when the credits are less than the tax owed unexpired credit carryforwards from prior years can be utilized in certain circumstances these circumstances are dependent upon both foreign source and domestic taxable income due to the recent low level of the us business units profitability we have implemented certain income tax elections to accelerate taxable income or to delay deductions in order to maintain positive domestic taxable income or to minimize a domestic taxable loss eg our election to capitalize research costs in the year incurred for us income tax purposes and amortize over a year life as opposed to taking the income tax deduction in the year incurred however many such actions cannot be repeated in future years and certain of those elections may make it more difficult to have positive domestic taxable income in future periods the profitability of our us business operations must continue to improve to provide us an opportunity to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards in the future in a manner that will be beneficial to our financial results however the american jobs creation act of increased the carryforward period of foreign tax credits from to years based on this extension of the carryforward period together with the current and forecasted profitability of our us business operations and the requirements of the foreign source income and credit calculations we currently believe that we will partially utilize the foreign tax credit carryforwards in an earnings beneficial manner prior to their expiration and therefore we have partially reserved these deferred tax assets as of december with million of valuation allowances reducing the net deferred tax asset to an amount that we estimate we will be able to realize we regularly update our estimates of domestic taxable income in order to evaluate whether the facts and circumstances have changed such that we must change our valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets likewise our carryforwards of federal research credits and us state tax credits require applicable taxable income in the respective tax returns in order to be utilized prior to their expirations we expect that we will be able to fully utilize our federal research credits which have a year carryforward period prior to their expiration however we do not currently expect sufficient future taxable income in our us state income tax returns to be able to utilize all of our state tax credits prior to their expiration primarily in new york and new jersey where the carryforward periods are and years respectively and credit utilization is limited to percent of the income tax liability as a result we have million of valuation allowances reducing our deferred tax assets to amounts that we estimate we will be able to realize we regularly update these estimates in order to evaluate whether the facts and circumstances have changed such that we must change our valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets under current us tax law federal alternative minimum tax or amt credit carryforwards have no expiration we believe that profitability will improve in our us operations in future years since the federal amt credit carryforwards have no expiration we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the full benefit of these credits in future years and thus we do not believe any valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets is appropriate as of december in summary of our valuation allowances at december million relates to nols in spain million relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards for purposes of us federal income taxes and million relates to us state credits we do not expect to generate taxable income in spain prior to expiration of nols in that jurisdiction the million related to foreign tax credits and the million related to state tax credits are dependent upon taxable income in the united states we do anticipate increased profitability in the united states in the future but not in sufficient enough amounts to fully realize these deferred tax assets in a beneficial manner prior to the expiration of the underlying credits it is possible that our estimates of future profitability in the united states could change from our current estimates based on business results or actions taken by us which effect taxable income while we do not currently believe it is likely that a material change will occur it is possible that changes in these factors changes in the level of foreign source income or a change in the likelihood of foreign tax credit utilization in an earnings beneficial manner could result in an adjustment of our valuation allowances in future periods due to the number of uncertain factors and the complexities of the calculations it is not possible to reasonably estimate what future impact could occur while we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of estimated net deferred income tax benefits it is possible that the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and judgments are based could change which could result in additional income tax expense in the future to increase the associated valuation allowances however we continue to evaluate possible methods to favorably utilize those assets that are reserved and therefore it is also possible that changes in the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and judgments are based could benefit us in the future by some of the million of deferred tax assets reserved as of december for additional information regarding income taxes and valuation allowances see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements pension accounting we recognize the estimated compensation cost of employees pension benefits over their approximate period of service to us in accordance with sfas no employers accounting for pensions our earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to pension benefits which primarily consist of us and french pension benefits each years recorded expense is an estimate based on actuarial calculations of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations for our various plans the calculations of pension benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts including the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the projected rate of future compensation increases we evaluate these assumptions at least once each year or as facts and circumstances dictate and make changes as conditions warrant we determine these actuarial assumptions after consultation with our actuaries on december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year changes to these assumptions will increase or decrease our reported income which will result in changes to the recorded benefit plan assets and liabilities we believe that our selections for these key actuarial assumptions are reasonable estimates for our plans and experience in july the decision was made and communicated to all affected us salaried employees that benefits related to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states would be frozen as of december this action was expected to reduce our annual pension expense and pension fund contribution requirements the plan was not terminated and benefits accrued as of december will continue to be paid in accordance with the plan terms allowable employee contributions and the employer matching percentage for the defined contribution or k plan were modified to partially offset the resulting employee pension benefit reduction the action included suspending the defined benefit pension plan so us salaried employees do not earn additional benefits for future service years or earnings beginning january this suspension of additional benefits for future service qualified this action for curtailment under sfas no employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits this action necessitated a remeasurement of our accumulated benefit obligation under our us pension plan and resulted in a curtailment gain in the third quarter of of million million after tax as part of the remeasurement we decreased the discount rate assumption from percent to percent to reflect changes in market interest rates turnover and retirement assumptions were modified to reflect a demographic assumption study additionally the mortality table assumption was also reviewed and updated to a more current mortality table annual rate of return and wage rate increase assumptions remained consistent with those previously disclosed in may we implemented the terms of our last and final offer following an impasse in negotiations with the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union on a collective bargaining agreement for the lee mills that had been extended since its original expiration date of july pursuant to the terms of the offer that we unilaterally implemented all affected hourly employees at the lee mills were notified that the further accrual of benefits under their defined benefit pension plan would be frozen as of july this termination of the accrual of additional benefits for future service qualified this action for curtailment under sfas no consequently hourly employees at the lee mills do not earn any additional benefits for future service years or earnings under the defined benefit plan beginning july this action is expected to reduce our future annual pension expense and pension fund contribution requirements the plan was not terminated and benefits accrued as of july will continue to be paid in accordance with the plan terms allowable employee contributions and the employer matching percentage for the defined contribution or k plan for the lee mills hourly employees were modified to partially offset the resulting employee pension benefit reduction the lee mills action necessitated a remeasurement of our accumulated benefit obligation under the us pension plan and resulted in a curtailment gain of million during the second quarter of as part of this remeasurement we increased the discount rate assumption from percent to percent to reflect changes in market interest rates other actuarial assumptions primarily asset returns wage rate increases plan population retirement assumptions mortality table and cash balance crediting rate remained consistent with those previously disclosed in accordance with sfas no we calculated our curtailment gains by first remeasuring our plan assets and projected benefit obligation or pbo as of the date of each of the curtailments excluding the effects of the curtailments but including the effects of the changes in assumptions we then remeasured the plan assets and pbo using the effects of the curtailment this enabled the effects of the curtailments on the respective pbo to be isolated without affecting the measurement for any change in the actuarial assumptions since the prior measurement date our us employee pension plans accounted for approximately percent of our total pension plan assets and total accumulated benefit obligations as of december the table below shows the assumptions that we used and will use to calculate us pension expense for the years shown discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase for the period of june to december the discount rate was increased to percent from percent for the period of july to december the discount rate was decreased to percent from percent the discount rates used for our determination of projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations for our us employee pension plans fluctuate from year to year based on current market interest rates for high quality fixed income investments we also evaluate the expected average duration of our pension obligations in determining our discount rate the discount rate assumption is determined based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with projected future plan cash flows a change in the discount rate assumption of percent would change our estimated us pension expense by approximately million the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by evaluating historical and projected returns for benchmark equity and fixed income market indices as well as the projected investment mix of our pension assets actual rates of return loss earned on us pension plan assets net of expense for each of the last years the period of time we have managed our pension assets were year return we utilized a monte carlo simulation analysis on the target us pension asset investment mix to determine our expected return on plan assets for and for we will maintain the expected rate of return on plan assets at percent the same as for the current asset allocation policy of our us employee pension plan targets an allocation of percent in equity securities percent in fixed income securities and percent in other investments a change in the long term rate of return on plan assets assumption of percent would change the estimated us pension expense by approximately million the rate of annual compensation increase is directly related to negotiated union contracts for our us hourly employees us salaried employees and lee mills hourly employees do not earn additional benefits for future service beginning january and july respectively despite our belief that the estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions future actual results will likely differ from our estimates and these differences could materially affect the future financial statements either favorably or unfavorably additionally it is possible that assets of our plans could decline as a result of negative investment returns which combined with increasing amounts of accumulated benefit obligations could result in us being required to make significant cash contributions to the plans in future periods as of december we adopted the provisions of sfas no employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no and r which required us to recognize the unfunded status of our postretirement plans measured as the difference between the pbo and plan assets at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet as of december for additional information regarding pension plan assets benefit obligations and accounting assumptions see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements litigation contingencies we evaluate contingencies in accordance with sfas no accounting for contingencies accordingly when a material loss contingency exists we accrue an estimated loss when the likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if no accrual is made for a material loss contingency because both of the above conditions are not met or if an exposure to loss exists materially in excess of an accrual that is made disclosure regarding the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred gains that might result from resolution of contingencies are not recorded until all contingencies have been resolved although disclosure is generally made regarding material gain contingencies imposto sobre circulao de mercadorias e servios or icms a form of value added tax in brazil was assessed to swm b in december of by the tax authorities of the state of rio de janeiro for unpaid icms taxes from january through november the assessment concerned the accrual and use by swm b of icms tax credits generated from the production and sale of certain non tobacco related grades of paper sold domestically that are immune from the tax to offset icms taxes otherwise owed on the sale of products that are not immune swm b has contested the assessment based on article vi of the brazilian federal constitution of which grants immunity from icms taxes to papers used in the production of books newspapers and periodicals or immune papers and the raw material inputs used to produce immune papers presently the assessment is on appeal before the superior tribunal of justice of brazil swm b continues to vigorously contest the assessment and believes that the assessment will ultimately be resolved in its favor however since the final resolution involves presentation of the matter to the supreme court of brazil it is not likely to be finally resolved for several years based on the foreign currency exchange rate at december the assessment totaled approximately million as of december of which approximately million is covered by an indemnification no liability has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the assessment based on our evaluation that swm b is more likely than not to prevail in its challenge of the assessment under the facts and law as presently understood imposto sobre produtos industrializados or ipi a form of federal value added tax in brazil swm b instituted action in march to recover credits on past and future purchases of raw materials that are exempt from ipi taxes or that carry an ipi tax rate of zero the recovery would be in the form of presumed credits that could be applied to offset other ipi tax liabilities the action for recovery is based on the principle in brazilian law of non cumulative taxes we received a favorable ruling on most of the merits of our claim the case is presently on appeal before the federal tribunal the potential recovery of ipi credits depending upon several contested factors could be in the range of million to million which amounts we consider a gain contingency and have not recorded in our consolidated financial statements the final resolution of this matter may entail judicial proceedings up to and including presentation of the matter to the supreme court of brazil and is not likely to be finally resolved for several years for further information please see litigation in part i item legal proceedings property plant and equipment valuation paper manufacturing which is our primary manufacturing process is a capital intensive process as a result we make substantial investments in property plant and equipment which are recorded at cost net property plant and equipment comprised percent of our total assets as of december the cost of depreciable property plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes over the depreciable lives of the assets depreciable lives are based on estimates of the useful lives of the assets that is the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of the asset paper machines and related equipment are not readily obsoleted and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years we periodically assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of long lived assets based on our expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related operations these factors along with managements plans with respect to the operations are considered in assessing the recoverability of property plant and equipment facts and circumstances upon which managements estimates and plans are based could change thus the possibility exists of a material adjustment to our financial statements in the future as a result of excess capacity in the tobacco related papers industry and increased operating costs experienced in the last to years particularly related to purchased energy competitive levels of selling prices for certain of our products are not sufficient to cover those costs with a margin that we consider reasonable such competitive pressures have resulted in downtime of certain paper machines and in some cases accelerated depreciation of certain equipment we initiated restructuring activities during which are expected to improve our competitiveness and profitability as well as an imbalance between sales demand and paper production capacity in the united states and france at the lee mills facility we initiated restructuring activities to reduce paper machine operations which resulted in million in accelerated depreciation in we also began restructuring activities at our pdm mill in quimperl france we plan to incur capital expenditures of approximately million to improve the cost competitiveness in our paper operations and quality of our products manufactured at pdm along with the shutdown of certain older equipment resulting in accelerated depreciation of million management continues to evaluate how to operate our production facilities more effectively with reduced tobacco related papers volumes further restructuring actions are possible that might require write offs or accelerated depreciation of some equipment particularly in france or the united states in the united states banded cigarette paper production assets at the spotswood mill are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years certain of these assets remain underutilized and likely would otherwise be shut down except that we have a contractual commitment to stand ready to produce commercial quantities of that product for our customer partially offsetting the net book value of these assets is unamortized deferred revenue which is being amortized to revenue as product is being purchased by that

our business outlook despite finishing with disappointing albeit expected financial results we are confident in our previously announced strategies for restructuring our french and us businesses to better balance capacity to available demand sales growth is planned for cigarette paper used in lip cigarettes and for rtl products additional progress is anticipated in cost reduction activities initiated across all our business units the benefits from cost reduction activities are expected to further offset the continuing unfavorable impacts of lower production volumes and inflationary cost increases that have been experienced during the last years the cautionary note to our improved outlook for is continued weakness in tobacco related product sales reduced demand for tobacco related paper products in western europe and the united states caused us to have excess production capacity throughout and increased machine downtime that unfavorably impacted operating profit by million our actions to reduce inventories especially in the fourth quarter of as well as the restructuring actions already announced place us in a better position to reduce these impacts in however we continue to evaluate how to operate our worldwide production facilities more effectively with the reduced volumes of tobacco related papers analysis is ongoing into possible further restructuring activities that could result in additional expenses pdm restructuring expenses are now projected to be in the range of to million for through including cash severance and other related costs of approximately to million and approximately million for non cash accelerated depreciation of fixed assets the actual amount of severance expenses will be dependent upon the final number of individuals within each of the possible categories for employee severance that include early retirement other voluntary means and involuntary terminations the pdm workforce reductions are expected to generate annual pre tax labor savings of approximately million due to both restructuring activities and planned capital investments full realization of the labor savings is expected to occur after the first quarter of we expect to realize annual pre tax benefits greater than million upon full implementation of all elements of the pdm strategy including the planned capital investments sales of cigarette papers for lip cigarettes are expected to continue to positively contribute to operating results in especially as we realize manufacturing efficiencies we experienced increased sales during the fourth quarter of prior to the january effective date for lower ignition propensity regulations in california with further increases in sales volumes of this cigarette paper combined with expected continuing improvements in manufacturing costs this product should provide additional improvement to the us business unit results inflationary cost increases totaled million in purchased energy cost increases have begun to slow and even reverse in the united states wood pulp prices continue to increase but at a slower percent rate during the fourth quarter of which brought the full year increase to percent pulp producers have announced a per metric ton or percent increase in the list price of nbsk effective in january while inflationary cost increases persist we believe the rate will slow and will be increasingly offset through improved mill operations and continued efforts to systematically control all areas of cost consistent with recent historical trends worldwide cigarette consumption is expected to increase at a rate of approximately to percent per year the anticipated decline in the production of cigarettes in developed countries is expected to be more than offset by increased cigarette production in developing countries that currently represent approximately percent of worldwide cigarette production population demographics and expected increases in disposable income are expected to support the increased consumption of cigarettes in developing countries in addition the litigation environment is different in most foreign countries compared with the united states having less of an impact on the pricing of cigarettes which in turn affects cigarette consumption cigarette production in the united states is expected to continue to decline as a result of reduced cigarette exports and a decline in domestic cigarette consumption caused by increased cigarette prices health concerns and public perceptions as well cigarette consumption has declined in western europe following recent tax increases on cigarette sales and smoking restrictions in developing countries there is a trend toward consumption of more sophisticated cigarettes which utilize higher quality tobacco related papers such as those we produce and rtl this trend toward more sophisticated cigarettes reflects increased governmental regulations concerning tar delivery levels and increased competition from multinational cigarette manufacturers based on these trends we expect worldwide demand for tobacco related papers and rtl products to continue to increase with a shift from developed countries to developing countries as a result we have been and continue to increase our production capacity in developing countries such as brazil the philippines indonesia and china forward looking

include those in the outlook and critical accounting policies and estimates sections and our expectations elsewhere in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and in factors that may affect future results under risk factors in item a they also include statements containing expect anticipate project appears should could may typically and similar words actual results may differ materially from the results suggested by these statements for a number of reasons including the following we have manufacturing facilities in countries and sell products in over countries as a result we are subject to a variety of import and export tax foreign currency labor and other regulations within these countries changes in these regulations or adverse interpretations or applications as well as changes in currency exchange rates could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways including increasing expenses decreasing sales limiting our ability to repatriate funds and generally limiting our ability to conduct business our financial performance is dependent upon the cost of raw materials particularly wood pulp purchased energy chemicals and labor recently the cost of these items has increased significantly and the nature of our agreements with our customers may make it difficult to pass changes in these costs on to our customers in a timely and effective manner our sales are concentrated to a limited number of customers in percent of our sales were to our largest customers the loss of or both such customers or a significant reduction in or both of these customers purchases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our financial performance is materially impacted by sales of both rtl products and lip cigarette papers a significant change in the sales or production volumes pricing or manufacturing costs of these products could have a material impact on future financial results as a result of excess capacity in the tobacco related papers industry and increased operating costs experienced in the last to years particularly related to purchased energy competitive levels of selling prices for certain of our products are not sufficient to cover those costs with a margin that we consider reasonable such competitive pressures have resulted in downtime of certain paper machines and in some cases accelerated depreciation of certain equipment and employee severance expenses associated with downsizing activities management continues to evaluate how to operate our production facilities more effectively with reduced tobacco related papers volumes further changes are possible that might require accelerated depreciation or write offs of some equipment and could possibly include additional expenses for employee related costs associated with further downsizing activities in recent years governmental entities around the world particularly in the united states and western europe have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products reports with respect to the possible harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products to limit smoking in public places and to increase taxes on such products are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products also in recent years certain governmental entities particularly in north america have enacted considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked furthermore it is not possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted or to what extent if any such legislation or regulations might affect our business item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information with respect to our market risk is contained under the caption
