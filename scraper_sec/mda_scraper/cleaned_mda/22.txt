trends in our business to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources these non gaap measures of operating results are reported to our board of directors chief executive officer and our president and chief operating officer and are used to make strategic and operating decisions and assess performance these non gaap measures are presented to enhance an understanding of our operating results and are not intended to represent cash flows or results of operations we also believe these non gaap measures are beneficial to investors potential investors and other key stakeholders including analysts and creditors who use these measures in their evaluations of our performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies in our industry the use of these non gaap financial measures is beneficial to these stakeholders because they exclude certain items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of our business and including them would distort comparisons to our past operating performance accordingly we have excluded the adjustments as detailed below for the purpose of calculating these non gaap measures the following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that we have made to arrive at these non gaap measures for the six months ended december of the successor the six months ended june of the predecessor and the years ended december and of the predecessor as well as the reasons management believes each of these items is not indicative of operating performance reorganization items income expense these income and expense items are directly related to the process of our reorganizing under chapter and the ccaa the items

by us to assess our operating performance non cash foreign currency exchange gains losses through june the functional currency for our canadian operations was the us dollar fluctuations in canadian dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities resulted in non cash gains or losses we excluded the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses because the impact of foreign exchange is highly variable and difficult to predict from period to period and is not tied to our operating performance these gains or losses are not considered indicative of ongoing operating performance and are not used by us to assess our operating performance interest on predecessor unsecured debt these amounts represent the post petition interest accrued on unsecured debt from the time of our bankruptcy filing which was stayed and not paid as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings in the fourth quarter of we concluded it was not probable that interest expense that was accrued from the petition date

performance litigation charges these charges are attributable to certain litigation matters these amounts represent significant charges during and do not reflect expected ongoing operating expenses loss on ineffective interest rate swaps marked to market this represents a loss recorded in interest expense as a result of our intention to refinance the underlying debt prior to its maturity this represented a significant charge to interest expense in the fourth quarter of and was not considered indicative of expected ongoing interest expense resolution of income tax matters these amounts represent the resolution of certain income tax matters during we were informed by a foreign taxing authority that certain matters related to our acquisition of a company had been resolved in our favor

performance adjusted net income loss adjusted net income loss per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda have certain material limitations associated with their use as compared to net income loss these limitations are primarily due to the exclusion of certain amounts that are material to our consolidated results of operations as discussed above in addition these adjusted net income loss and ebitda measures may differ from adjusted net income loss and ebitda calculations of other companies in our industry limiting their usefulness as comparative measures because of these limitations adjusted net income loss adjusted net income loss per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using adjusted net income loss adjusted net income loss per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental measures of our operating performance the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we believe that providing these non gaap measures in addition to the related gaap measures provides investors greater transparency to the information our management uses for financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results as management sees them we also believe that providing this information better enables investors to understand our operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure our operating performance and the methodology and financial measures used by our board of directors to assess managements performance the following financial presentation includes a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common stockholders and net income loss per diluted share

the successor period ended december were tax effected however for the predecessor periods of the six months ended june and the year ended december other than reorganization items income expense the

our operating facilities and customers are located primarily in the united states and canada market conditions and demand for our products are subject to cyclical changes in the economy and changes in industry capacity both of which can significantly impact selling prices and our profitability in recent years the loss of us manufacturing to offshore competition and the changing retail environment in the us has played a key role in reducing growth in domestic packaging demand the influence of superstores and discount retailing giants as well as the impact from online shopping has resulted in a shifting of demand to packaging which is more condensed lighter weight and less expensive these factors have greatly influenced the corrugated industry for the six months ended december and june and the year ended december we had operating income loss of million million and million respectively operating income for the six months ended december and june was positively impacted by higher segment profits principally due to higher average selling prices for containerboard higher third party sales volume of containerboard and corrugated containers and reduced market related downtime which were partially offset by higher costs for reclaimed fiber the operating profit was positively impacted by other operating income of million related to the alternative fuel tax credits but was negatively impacted by lower average sales prices lower sales volumes and higher restructuring expenses due primarily to the closure of two containerboard mills our outlook for is for business fundamentals and packaging demand to remain stable while we expect inflation in our fiber energy and other key input costs we expect improved earnings in compared to due to higher average sales prices and volumes and

improvement in our cash flow from operations in we expect that our cash flow from operations and our unused borrowing capacity under the exit credit facilities in combination will be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments including debt service pension funding costs related to environmental compliance and other capital expenditures contingent obligations we issue standby letters of credit primarily for performance bonds and for self insurance letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facilities generally have a one year maturity and are renewed annually as of december we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding we have certain woodchip processing contracts which provide for guarantees of third party contractors debt outstanding with a security interest in the chipping equipment guarantee payments would be triggered in the event of a loan default by any of the contractors the maximum potential amount of future payments related to all of such arrangements as of december was million cash proceeds received from liquidation of the chipping equipment would be based on market conditions at the time of sale and we may not recover in full the guarantee payments made pension obligations at december the qualified defined pension benefit plans which were assumed under the plan of reorganization were underfunded by approximately million based on actual asset values and the discount rates effective on december the weighted average discount rates used at december for the us and canadian qualified defined benefit pension plans were and respectively we currently estimate that the cash contributions under the us and canadian qualified pension plans will be approximately million in we currently estimate that contributions will be in the range of approximately million to million annually in through projected pension contributions reflect that we have elected funding relief under the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of and also reflect our election of canadas funding relief measures made in and the actual required amounts and timing of such future cash contributions will be highly sensitive to changes in the applicable discount rates and returns on plan assets exit liabilities successor we recorded restructuring charges of million for the six months ended december primarily for severance and benefits related to the closure of facilities and the reduction in our selling and administrative workforce we had million of exit liabilities as of june related to the restructuring of our operations for the six months ended december we incurred cash expenditures of million for these exit liabilities the exit liabilities remaining as of december including the restructuring activities totaled million future cash outlays principally for severance and benefits cost and table of contents long term lease commitments and facility closure cost are expected to be million in insignificant amounts in and and million thereafter we intend to continue funding exit liabilities through operations as originally planned predecessor we recorded restructuring charges of million for the six months ended june net of gains of million from the sale of properties related to previously closed facilities of which million resulted from the legal release of environmental liability obligations restructuring charges include non cash charges of million related to the acceleration of depreciation for converting equipment abandoned or taken out of service the remaining charges of million were for severance and benefits lease commitments and facility closure costs we had million of exit liabilities as of december related to the restructuring of our operations for the six months ended june we incurred million of cash disbursements primarily severance and benefits related to these exit liabilities in addition these exit liabilities were reduced by million resulting from the release of environmental liability obligations upon the sale of previously closed facilities and million due to the reclassification of multi employer pension plan liabilities to liabilities subject to compromise during the six months ended june we incurred million of cash disbursements primarily severance and benefits related to exit liabilities established during environmental matters as discussed in part i item business environmental compliance we completed all projects required to bring us into compliance with the now vacated boiler mact however we could incur significant expenditures due to changes in law or discovery of new information in addition it is not yet known when greenhouse gas emission laws or regulations may come into effect nor is it currently possible to estimate the cost of compliance with such laws or regulations excluding spending on boiler mact projects and other one time compliance costs we have spent an average of approximately million in each of the last three years on capital expenditures for environmental purposes and we expect to spend approximately million in off balance sheet arrangement at december we had one off balance sheet financing arrangement we sold acres of owned and leased timberland in october the final purchase price after adjustments was million we received million in cash and million in the form of installment notes under our program to monetize the installment notes receivable the notes were sold without recourse to timber note holdings llc tnh a non consolidated variable interest entity under the provisions of asc for million in cash proceeds and a residual interest in the notes the residual interest included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet was million at december see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements tnh and its creditors have no recourse to us in the event of a default on the installment notes effects of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs such as fiber energy and freight costs have an impact on our operating results changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years fiber energy and freight cost increases are strongly influenced by supply and demand factors including competition in global markets and from hurricanes or other natural disasters in certain regions of the united states and when supplies become tight we have experienced increases in the cost of these items we continue to seek ways to mitigate the impact of table of contents such cost increases and to the extent permitted by competition pass the increased cost on to customers by increasing sales prices over time we used the last in first out method of accounting for approximately of our inventories at december under this method the cost of goods sold reported in the financial statements approximates current cost and thus provides a closer matching of revenue and expenses in periods of increasing costs upon emergence from chapter and ccaa bankruptcy proceedings property plant and equipment was valued at fair value which approximates replacement costs of existing fixed assets critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment however actual results may differ from these estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments our most critical accounting policies and use of estimates are described below fresh start accounting upon emergence from chapter we adopted fresh start accounting as prescribed by asc which required us to revalue our assets and liabilities to fair value asc among other things defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements fresh start accounting provides among other things for a determination of the value to be assigned to the equity of the emerging company as of a date selected for financial reporting purposes in conjunction with the bankruptcy proceedings a third party financial advisor provided an enterprise value of the company of approximately million to million with a midpoint of million enterprise value of the company was estimated using various valuation methods including i comparable public company analysis ii discounted cash flow analysis dcf and iii precedent transaction analysis the preliminary equity value set forth by the third party was million using the midpoint enterprise value of million and adjusting for expected cash and debt balances upon emergence and expected cash proceeds from the sale of non operating assets the final equity value of was determined consistent with the third party methodology using the midpoint enterprise value of million the companys reorganization value was allocated to its assets and liabilities in conformity with the procedures specified by asc business combinations as a result of adopting fresh start accounting the company recorded goodwill of million which represents the excess of reorganization value over amounts assigned to the other assets all estimates assumptions and financial projections including the fair value adjustments the financial projections and the enterprise value and reorganization value projections are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and financial projections will be realized and actual results could vary materially for the impact that the adoption of fresh start accounting had on our consolidated balance sheet see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements table of contents long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets we conduct impairment reviews of long lived assets in accordance with asc impairment or disposal of long lived assets and asc intangibles goodwill and other based upon our review as of december we determined that there was no impairment of long lived assets including goodwill such reviews require us to make estimates of future cash flows and fair values our cash flow projections include significant assumptions about economic conditions demand and pricing for our products and costs our estimates of fair value are determined using a variety of valuation techniques including cash flows while significant judgment is required we believe that our estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable however should our assumptions change in future years our fair value models could indicate lower fair values for long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets which could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and results of operations restructurings in recent years we have closed a number of operating facilities including paper mills and exited non core businesses identifying and calculating the cost to exit these businesses requires certain assumptions to be made the most significant of which are anticipated future liabilities including leases and other contractual obligations and the adjustment of property plant and equipment to net realizable value we believe our estimates are reasonable considering our knowledge of the paper industry previous experience in exiting activities and valuations received from independent third parties in the calculation of such estimates although our estimates have been reasonably accurate in the past significant judgment is required and these estimates and assumptions may change as additional information becomes available and facts or circumstances change allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable on a case by case basis and make adjustments to the bad debt reserve for expected losses we also estimate reserves for bad debts based on historical experience and past due status of the accounts we perform credit evaluations and adjust credit limits based upon each customers payment history and credit worthiness while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established actual bad debt write offs may differ from our estimates resulting in higher or lower charges in the future for our allowance for doubtful accounts pension and postretirement benefits we have significant long term liabilities related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans the determination of pension obligations and expense is dependent upon our selection of certain assumptions the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates applied to plan liabilities consulting actuaries assist us in determining these assumptions which are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at june in conjunction with fresh start accounting we updated our mortality rate table assumptions which increased our employer benefit liabilities by approximately million for the six months ended december and june and the year ended december the expected long term rate of return on our us plan assets was for the six months ended december and june and the year ended december the expected long term rates of return on our canadian plan assets were and respectively the weighted average discount rates used to determine the qualifed defined benefit obligations for the us and foreign retirement plans at december were and respectively the assumed rate for the long term return on plan assets was determined based upon target asset allocations and table of contents expected long term rates of return by asset class for determination of the discount rate the present value of the cash flows as of the measurement date is determined using the spot rates from the mercer yield curve a decrease in the assumed rate of return of would increase pension expense by approximately million an increase in the discount rate of would increase our pension expense by approximately million and decrease our pension benefit obligations by approximately million effective january the expected long term rate of return on our us plan assets was reduced to the assumed rate for the long term return on plan assets was determined based upon target asset allocations and expected long term rates of return by asset class related to our postretirement benefit plans we make assumptions for future trends for medical care costs the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december by million and would increase the annual net periodic postretirement benefits cost by an immaterial amount income taxes we apply the provisions of asc income taxes asc which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements under the provisions of asc we elected to classify interest and penalties related to our unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at december we had million of net unrecognized tax benefits the primary differences between gross unrecognized tax benefits and net unrecognized tax benefits are associated with the us federal tax benefit from state tax deductions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of activity for the six months ended december and june no interest or penalties were recorded related to tax positions taken during the current and prior years at december no interest or penalties were recognized in the consolidated balance sheet all net unrecognized tax benefits if recognized would affect our effective tax rate deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate these assessments involve temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in addition unrecognized tax benefits under the provisions of asc reflect estimates of our current tax exposures based on our evaluation of our tax positions we believe we were adequately reserved for these matters at december at december we had deferred tax assets of million a valuation allowance of million has been established on a portion of these deferred tax assets based on the expected timing of deferred tax liability reversals and the expiration dates of the tax loss carryforwards the valuation allowance decreased during primarily to reflect our ability to utilize net operating losses in future years due to our emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of fresh start accounting at december we expect our deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance will be fully realized through the reversal of net taxable temporary differences and utilization of net operating losses as previously disclosed the canada revenue agency cra was examining our income tax returns for tax years through in connection with the examination the cra had issued assessments of additional income taxes interest and penalties related to transfer prices of inventory sold by our canadian subsidiaries to our us subsidiaries additionally the cra was considering certain significant adjustments related principally to taxable income related to our acquisition of a canadian company pursuant to the plan of reorganization we entered into an agreement with the cra and table of contents other provincial tax authorities that took effect upon our emergence from bankruptcy which settled the open canadian income tax matters through january as a result of this agreement we reported a million net income tax benefit related to the final settlement of the canadian tax claims and the release of the previously accrued unrecognized tax benefits related to the canadian audit for the six months ended june the us federal statute of limitations is closed through there are currently no federal examinations in progress in addition we file tax returns in numerous states the states statutes of limitations are generally open for the same years as the federal statute of limitations federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries during as we intend to indefinitely reinvest such earnings into our foreign subsidiaries at december undistributed earnings for our foreign subsidiaries were million legal and environmental contingencies accruals for legal and environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are developed based on currently available information and require judgments as to probable outcomes assumptions are based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel environmental estimates include assumptions and judgments about particular sites remediation alternatives and environmental regulations we believe our accruals are adequate however due to uncertainties associated with these assumptions and judgments as well as potential changes to governmental regulations and environmental technologies actual costs could differ materially from the estimated amounts self insurance we self insure a majority of our workers compensation costs other workers compensation and general liability costs are subject to specific retention levels for certain policies and coverage losses above these retention levels are transferred to insurance companies in addition we self insure the majority of our group health care costs all of the workers compensation general liability and group health care claims are handled by third party administrators consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims losses are accrued based upon the aggregate self insured claims determined by the third party administrators actuarial assumptions and our historical experience while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers compensation general liability and group health care costs table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including commodity price risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk to manage the volatility related to these risks we have on a periodic basis entered into various derivative contracts the majority of these contracts are settled in cash however such settlements have not had a significant effect on our liquidity in the past nor are they expected to be significant in the future we do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes on january the chapter petition and the canadian petition effectively terminated all existing derivative instruments termination fair values were calculated based on the potential settlement value our termination value related to our remaining derivative liabilities was approximately million these derivative liabilities were stayed due to the filing of the chapter petition and the canadian petition at which time these liabilities were adjusted through oci for derivative instruments qualifying for hedge accounting and cost of goods sold for derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting subsequently the amounts adjusted through oci were recorded in earnings when the underlying transaction was recognized or when the underlying transaction was no longer expected to occur as of june all amounts in oci were recognized through earnings on june the derivative contract termination liabilities of million were paid in connection with our emergence from our chapter and ccaa bankruptcy proceedings see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements commodity price risk prior to filing for bankruptcy we used financial derivative instruments including fixed price swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from commodity price risk in the procurement of natural gas and other commodities our objective was to fix the price of a portion of the purchases of these commodities used in the manufacturing process the changes in the market value of such derivative instruments historically offset the changes in price of the hedged item excluding the impact of derivative instruments the change in our and natural gas cost based upon our expected annual usage and unit cost resulting from a hypothetical adverse price change would be approximately million and million respectively the changes in energy cost discussed in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include the impact of the natural gas derivative instruments see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements foreign currency risk our principal foreign exchange exposure is the canadian dollar assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in canada prior to emerging from bankruptcy the functional currency for our canadian operations was the us dollar fluctuations in canadian dollar monetary assets and liabilities resulted in gains or losses which were credited or charged to income upon emergence we reviewed the primary economic indicators for our canadian operations under the reorganized smurfit stone including cash flow indicators sales price indicators sales market indicators expense indicators financing indicators and intercompany transactions as required by asc foreign currency matters based on our analysis including current operations and financing availability within canada we determined the functional currency for our canadian operations to be the local currency as a result effective july the assets and liabilities for the canadian operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year translation gains or losses are included within stockholders equity as part of oci for the predecessor periods we used financial derivative instruments including forward contracts and options primarily to protect against canadian currency exchange risk associated with expected future table of contents cash flows the canadian dollar as of june compared to december weakened against the us dollar the canadian dollar as of december compared to december strengthened we recognized non cash foreign currency exchange gains of million for the six month period ended june and a loss of million for the year ended december during the successor period ended december the canadian dollar as of december compared to june strengthened against the us dollar and as a result we recorded a million gain net of tax in oci related to the translation of our canadian operations we performed a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential oci loss from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant excluding the impact of derivative instruments the potential impact from a hypothetical adverse change in the canadian dollar exchange rate as of december would be million net of tax during the six months ended december we entered into foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to minimize the exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations on a million canadian dollar denominated inter company note established upon emergence between a us subsidiary and a canadian subsidiary whereby the us subsidiary is the lender the inter company note which is denominated in canadian dollars matures on june and the interest is payable quarterly the derivative contracts are monthly or quarterly instruments with a notional amount equal to the inter company note principal plus accrued interest the derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings on a monthly or quarterly basis for the six months ended december our us subsidiary recorded a million foreign currency gain net of tax in other net in the consolidated statements of operations related to the revaluation of the inter company note we recorded a million loss net of tax in other net in the consolidated statements of operations on the settlement of the derivative contracts we recorded million loss net of tax in other net in the consolidated statements of operations related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts interest rate risk our earnings and cash flow are significantly affected by the amount of interest on our indebtedness upon emergence our financing arrangements included variable rate debt a change in the interest rate on the variable rate debt will impact interest expense and cash flows our objective is to mitigate interest rate volatility and reduce or cap interest expense within acceptable levels of market risk we may enter into interest rate swaps caps or options to hedge interest rate exposure and manage risk within company policy any derivative would be specific to the debt instrument contract or transaction which would determine the specifics of the hedge see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements we performed a sensitivity analysis that measures the change in interest expense on our variable rate debt arising from a hypothetical basis point adverse movement in interest rates based on our outstanding variable rate debt as of december a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not impact our interest expense because the adjusted libor rate as of december was compared to our minimum term loan facility adjusted libor rate of per annum according to the term loan
