accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimateswe believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statementsmerchandise inventories our inventories are valued using the retail method based on retail prices less markup percentages which approximates the lower of first in first out fifo cost or market we record adjustments to inventory through cost of sales when retail price reductions or markdowns are taken against on hand inventory in addition we make estimates and judgments regarding among other things initial markups markdowns future demand for specific product categories and market conditions all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation these estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period while we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections it is possible actual results could differ from recorded estimates this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise we estimate inventory losses for damaged lost or stolen inventory inventory shrinkage for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts stores receive a physical inventory at least annually there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal as a result of the strategic initiative to close underperforming stores during the second half of fiscal an additional million of markdowns were incurred to sell through inventory at these stores additionally an adjustment to shrink expense was made to cost of sales for any inventory balance remaining on the books and records after the stores were closed refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on restructuring activitiesproperty and equipment we state property and equipment at cost we calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for leasehold improvements this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease generally between five and fifteen years including reasonably assured renewal options or the assets useful economic life the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates the increase in gross property and equipment before depreciation is not commensurate with capital expenditures as a result of the impairment recorded for underperforming stores closed as part of the companys strategic initiatives in fiscal and as a result of the significant amount of assets sold during the year under sale leaseback transactions we generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as a result of the strategic initiative to close underperforming stores during the second half of fiscal an impairment of million on property and equipment was recorded in fiscal refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on restructuring activities refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on property and equipmentinsurance liabilities we are primarily self insured for health care property loss workers compensation general liability and auto liability costs these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of retail locations and employees our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported less amounts paid against such claims and are not discounted we review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates we also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical workers compensation general liability and auto liability claims the insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense sales number of vehicles and the frequency and severity of claims the estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or if the historical trend is not indicative of future trends then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operationswe record our liabilities for workers compensation general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis and record a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies on the consolidated balance sheets in
