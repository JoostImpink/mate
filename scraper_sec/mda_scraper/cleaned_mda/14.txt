item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in this section management discusses the financial condition results of operations cash flows and expected future performance of the company and its four primary business segments the discussion applies to peoples energy and its business segments on a consolidated basis with the exception of the section titled peoples gas and north shore gas discussions which provides information specific to the companys two regulated utility subsidiaries certain other results of operations and information specific to peoples gas and north shore gas are also found in item businessgas distribution segment and in this item under liquidity and capital resources managements discussion should be read in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements and related notes unless otherwise noted earnings per share are presented on a diluted basis executive summary peoples energy is a diversified energy company that conducts operations in four main business segments gas distribution oil and gas production energy marketing energy assets the gas distribution segment has the most significant impact on the companys consolidated financial results the remaining segments represent a portfolio of complementary energy businesses that the company has developed to diversify the sources of consolidated operating income the regulated gas distribution utilities with service territories in chicago and its northern suburbs form the core of peoples energy until recently they have generated reliable earnings near the rate of return on equity allowed by the commission approximately since fiscal operating results reflect continued erosion in gas distribution segment results including a million pre tax gas charge settlement pursuant to commission orders issued on march that settled gas charge reconciliation proceedings for fiscal years through our two natural gas utilities peoples gas and north shore gas have not increased their delivery rates in eleven years during which time operating costs have increased and throughput has declined the business environment in which peoples gas and north shore gas operate benefits from a fundamentally strong economic base the service territories are mature and natural gas has a high penetration in its markets however gas usage per customer has declined steadily in recent years due to lower weather normalized demand primarily reflecting customer conservation it is unclear how much of the load loss is permanent but customers are reacting to higher bills by lowering their consumption the diversified energy businesses use a low to moderate risk approach to develop assets and services that can provide long term growth and supplement the base of utility earnings since the contribution of operating income from the companys diversified businesses has grown from an insignificant amount to million including million in operating income from the discontinued operations of the power generation business in fiscal the company announced in february its intention to exit the power generation business on january the company sold its interest in the valencia energy power development site in new mexico on may the company completed the sale of its interest in the scep facility to exelon generation company llc on september the company announced that it signed an agreement with j power usa development co ltd j power to sell its interest in the elwood power generation facility and its interest in a fully permitted power development site the cob energy facility cob for million subject to certain closing adjustments these sales will complete the divestiture of substantially all power assets owned by peoples energy the board of directors of j powers parent company approved the transactions on november financial results for power generation are now being reported by peoples energy as discontinued operations through elwood and cob the company owned approximately net megawatts of power generation assets merger pursuant to the definitive merger agreement entered into between peoples energy and wps resources on july in august the companies jointly filed an application for approval of the merger with the commission required regulatory approvals at the federal level including those with the sec ferc and department of justice either have been or are expected to be received by december special shareholder meetings were held by both companies on december to seek shareholder approval of the transaction shareholders of both wps resources and peoples energy approved the merger the companies are targeting a closing date for the merger during the first calendar quarter of see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the merger rate case the company announced in september that peoples gas and north shore gas planned to file delivery rate increases with the commission however those plans have been postponed to allow peoples energy and wps resources to focus on gaining approvals for the merger the companies are seeking expedited consideration of the application for approval of the merger by the commission the application indicates that peoples gas and north shore gas will further postpone filing rate cases until early with new rates to take effect in due to the normal month rate case process in illinois strategic restructuring in fiscal the company took actions to improve the financial performance of its utilities by restructuring its utility and corporate support areas the organizational restructuring targeted elimination of over salaried positions or about of the companys nonunion workforce overall about employees accepted the voluntary severance offer that accompanied the restructuring see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements earnings outlook due to the pending merger with wps resources peoples energy is not providing a specific earnings outlook for fiscal at this time however the company expects some improvement in earnings excluding the impact of merger related expenses driven primarily by higher earnings from the energy marketing and oil and gas production segments excluding the effects in fiscal of the gas charge settlement gas distribution results are not likely to improve materially over fiscal absent increases in delivery rates which are not expected before the second quarter of fiscal key planning assumptions utilized by the company for fiscal include normal weather based on a year average of degree days representing a change from the companys previous degree day planning assumption which in fiscal utilized a year average of degree days an average nymex gas price of per mmbtu a utility bad debt rate and higher expenses in the gas distribution and corporate and other segments capital expenditures are estimated at million with nearly half in the gas distribution segment and the remainder primarily in the oil and gas production segment no acquisitions have been budgeted in the oil and gas production segment other assumptions include higher interest expense a effective tax rate and slightly higher common shares outstanding financial results financial results for fiscal years and are summarized in the following table operating income for fiscal includes a million pre tax charge per share after tax for settlement of utility gas charge proceedings for fiscal years through as well as related civil litigation and million of expenses pre tax related to the companys recently announced proposed merger with wps resources results for fiscal include million in pension charges pre tax related to the companys organizational restructuring income from discontinued operations relates to the companys power generation business ongoing operating income non gaap and ongoing income from continuing operations non gaap are defined as gaap operating income and gaap income from continuing operations respectively adjusted to exclude the effects of the fiscal settlement charge merger expenses and last years restructuring charge management believes that such measures of ongoing results are useful for year over year comparisons since charges of this magnitude are infrequent and affect the comparability of operating results ongoing operating income and ongoing income from continuing operations are used internally to measure performance and in reports for management and the companys board of directors merger restructuring ongoing and settlement as reported in thousands except per share amounts non gaap charges gaap for fiscal years ended september operating income loss gas distribution oil and gas production energy marketing energy assets corporate and other total operating income loss income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net of income taxes net income loss per diluted share income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income loss ongoing operating income for fiscal decreased million primarily driven by the following items gas distribution deliveries for the year declined an estimated from the prior year due to customer conservation in addition fiscal utility deliveries were negatively impacted by warmer than normal weather gas distribution results were also negatively impacted by sharply higher operating expenses pursuant to the amended gas charge settlement hub revenues for the gas distribution segment in fiscal are being recorded as a credit to customers gas charges negatively impacting year over year comparisons by million oil and gas production volumes were up for fiscal compared to a year ago this improvement reflects strong performance of both existing and new wells and the impact of the companys fiscal will drill acquisition offset by the normal decline rate of existing production net realized prices increased sharply in fiscal partially offset by higher operating costs energy marketing results were negatively impacted by an unrealized loss of million for the year due to locom inventory adjustments and mtm accounting of energy contracts the impact of which was magnified by a significant decline in the market price of natural gas during the latter half of september approximately million of the year end impact from these adjustments is timing related and is expected to reverse over fiscal year over year comparisons were negatively impacted by a million gain in last years fourth quarter associated with the sale by trigen peoples district energy of which peoples energy owned a interest of its district heating and cooling plant in chicago which was reported in the corporate and other segment results of operations statement of operations variations fiscal the companys revenues and cost of energy sold increased million and million respectively the increases are due to the impact of higher commodity prices at the gas distribution and energy marketing segments as well as a year over year increase in average daily production volumes and higher net realized prices at the oil and gas production segment these increases were partially offset by the impacts on the gas distribution segment of warmer weather and an estimated decrease in deliveries resulting from customer conservation revenue comparisons were also adversely impacted by the change in the regulatory treatment of hub revenue in the gas distribution segment in fiscal the company recorded a million pretax charge related to a settlement of the companys gas charge proceedings for fiscal years through approved by the commission as discussed in notes c and a of the notes to consolidated financial statements also the company recorded million of costs incurred in connection with the merger see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the merger in fiscal the company recorded million in pension related charges resulting from its organizational restructuring commenced in the fall of fiscal as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements utility environmental costs increased million for fiscal and relate to investigation and remediation activities at multiple sites that formerly had operations for gas manufacturing and the storage of manufactured gas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statement for further discussion these costs are recovered through the utilities rate mechanism and a similar amount is included in revenues therefore these costs do not affect operating income operation and maintenance expense excluding the above mentioned merger costs environmental costs and restructuring related pension charges increased million significant items to note in fiscal were increased bad debt expense at the gas distribution segment of million for fiscal due to high natural gas prices and their corresponding impact on revenues increased pension expense at corporate and the gas distribution segment totaling million due to lower discount rates increased direct labor costs at corporate and the gas distribution segment totaling million for fiscal primarily due to increases in wages and headcount increased lease operating exploration and general and administrative costs at the oil and gas production segment totaling million rate case costs of million expensed during fiscal other variances for dda increased million in total and at the oil and gas production segment increased million primarily due to the impacts of higher production and higher dda rates taxes other than income taxes increased million primarily due to higher revenue taxes million in the gas distribution segment due to higher revenues revenue taxes are recovered through the utilities rate mechanism and a similar amount included in revenues therefore these costs do not affect operating income equity investment income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal results include the million pretax gain associated with the first quarter sale of certain assets at the companys enervest energy lp enervest partnership fiscal results include a million gain related to the fourth quarter sale of assets by the companys equity investment trigen peoples district energy recorded in the corporate and other segment fiscal results also reflect a full year of equity investment income from both these investments interest expense increased million due primarily to higher interest rates higher short term borrowing balances and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate adjustments income tax expense decreased million primarily due to the charge for the amended settlement agreement related to the companys gas charge proceedings and related tax benefit of million the effective tax rate on fiscal ongoing income non gaap excluding the impact of the gas charge settlement and merger costs was about down from last year due to the impact of lower income before taxes and federal medicare subsidies excludable from taxable income pre tax income from discontinued operations totaled million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal results included a million pre tax gain from the sale of scep a million pre tax loss from the sale of the valencia development site and lower depreciation expense at elwood fiscal results reflect a full year of scep equity investment income fiscal the companys revenues and cost of energy sold increased million and million respectively in fiscal compared to fiscal the increases are due to higher commodity prices in the gas distribution segment and increased sales volumes in the energy marketing segment partially offset by a decrease in gas distribution deliveries resulting from warmer weather and ongoing conservation measures by utility customers in addition average daily production volumes at the oil and gas production segment were down compared to the prior year due to well performance rig availability and other timing delays the company recorded million in pension related charges in fiscal resulting from its organizational restructuring commenced in compared to million in restructuring costs recorded in fiscal as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements utility environmental costs increased million and relate to investigation and remediation activities at multiple sites that formerly had operations for gas manufacturing and the storage of manufactured gas operation and maintenance expense excluding the above mentioned environmental costs and restructuring related pension charges decreased million significant items to note in fiscal were decreased direct labor costs primarily at corporate and the gas distribution segment of million as a result of the organizational restructuring exploration costs in the oil and gas production segment decreased million reflecting a significant dry hole expense recognized in fiscal lease operating expense and general and administrative expenses in the oil and gas production segment increased million in aggregate primarily as a result of a general increase in the cost of goods and services increased outside service expense of million much of which related to sarbanes oxley compliance work increased insurance employee group insurance and other benefit expenses totaling million other variances for dda decreased million mainly due to the million impact of the approval by the commission in april of new depreciation rates that reflect longer useful lives on utility plant commission depreciation order the oil and gas production segment also had lower dda expense million in fiscal taxes other than income taxes increased million primarily due to higher revenue taxes in the gas distribution segment equity investment income increased million primarily due to the million gain related to the sale of assets by the companys equity investment trigen peoples district energy interest expense increased million due primarily to higher interest rates income tax expense increased million as tax expense in fiscal was positively impacted by several items including adjustments to accrued income taxes based on updated estimates of income tax liabilities and tax legislation which resulted in the company realizing tax benefits from dividends reinvested in peoples energy stock under the companys employee stock ownership plan income from discontinued operations net of taxes increased million primarily due to the results of the energy assets segments elwood facility which included the companys portion million of a reduction in prior and current period expenses primarily depreciation on generating equipment segment discussion a summary of the companys operating income by segment income from discontinued operations and variations between periods is presented below for fiscal years ended september increasedecrease in thousands vs vs operating income gas distribution oil and gas production energy marketing energy assets corporate and other total operating income income from discontinued operations energy assets power generation corporate and other less income tax expense income from discontinued operations gas distribution segment revenues of peoples gas and north shore gas are directly impacted by fluctuations in weather because both companies have a large number of heating customers fluctuations in weather have the potential to significantly impact year to year comparisons of operating income and cash flow revenues of peoples gas and north shore gas are also affected by changes in the unit cost of the utilities gas purchases and do not include the cost of gas supplies for customers who purchase gas directly from producers and marketers in a steady gas price environment the unit cost of gas does not have a significant direct effect on operating income because the utilities tariffs provide for dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs see note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements however significant changes in gas costs can materially affect the reserve for uncollectible accounts customer demand and working capital needs fiscal revenues for the gas distribution segment increased million over primarily due to the impact of changes in commodity prices an increase of million that are recovered on a dollar for dollar basis this impact was partially offset by decreases in deliveries due to warmer weather million lower weather normalized demand million and by the impact of the change in the regulatory treatment of hub revenues million due to the amended settlement agreement operating income for fiscal decreased million reflecting the impact of the amended settlement agreement the million in settlement charges recorded in fiscal and the million liability recognized in prior periods reflect the following settlement amounts million in refunds to customers million related to the payment to the city and the ag pursuant to the settlement agreement million to reflect a change in regulatory treatment for fiscal hub revenues and an estimated million net increase in bad debt expense primarily related to the termination of collection activities on approximately million of bad debt written off during fiscal years for fiscal ongoing non gaap operating income was million compared to million last year the decrease was due primarily to the impact of lower gas deliveries million including an estimated decline in weather normalized demand due to the impact of customer conservation a weather insurance recovery recorded in fiscal million the change in treatment of hub revenues million and higher operating expenses million weather for fiscal was degree days or warmer than last year the increase in operating costs primarily reflected higher pension expenses million labor related expenses million rate case costs million and higher bad debt expense bad debt increased million due to high natural gas prices and their corresponding impact on revenues the bad debt accrual rate remained unchanged at approximately of revenue fiscal revenues increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to the impact on revenues of higher commodity prices million that are recovered on a dollar for dollar basis partially offsetting this effect were decreases in deliveries due primarily to warmer weather million weather was warmer compared to fiscal operating income decreased million compared with the previous year due to the effects of warmer weather million lower weather normalized deliveries million higher outside services expense million the insurance recovery million related to mercury cleanup costs incurred in prior years and increases in numerous other nonlabor expenses aggregating million partially offsetting these negative variations are the effect of the fiscal accounts receivable adjustment million decreased direct labor costs related to the organizational restructuring million reduced depreciation expense million as a result of the commission depreciation order and increased

monthly temperatures at chicagos ohare airport for the years normal heating degree days for fiscal are based on a year average of monthly temperatures at chicagos ohare airport for the years margin per dth is based upon gas distribution and transportation activity and excludes the impact of hub revenues and hub volumes oil and gas production segment revenues and operating income for fiscal increased million and million respectively compared with the same period last year the increase in revenue is due primarily to higher net realized commodity prices as older hedge positions continued to roll off and a increase in equivalent average daily production the improvement in production from a year ago reflects the results of the companys drilling program and the impact of the february acquisition of properties from will drill resources inc will drill partially offset by the normal decline of existing production fiscal operating income results benefited from significantly higher net realized prices due to a lower percentage of gas volumes hedged compared to nearly a year ago a small increase in production and higher results from the companys enervest partnership which benefited from a million pretax gain associated with the sale of assets last years net realized price was negatively impacted by an million hedge ineffectiveness charge resulting from wider than normal differentials between nymex and wellhead prices primarily due to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita the improvements in production and realized commodity prices were partially offset by higher operating costs million most notably higher general and administrative expense million and depletion expenses million in fiscal the company drilled wells related to the will drill acquisition with a success rate of fiscal revenues and operating income decreased million and million respectively compared with fiscal due mainly to lower production volumes and oil and gas hedge ineffectiveness million hedge ineffectiveness was primarily due to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita on the price differentials between nymex and field prices on an equivalent basis average daily production volumes declined compared to the prior year due to well performance rig availability and other timing delays increases in lease operating expense million and lower equity investment income from the companys investment in enervest million higher production taxes associated with higher wellhead gas prices and administrative costs million also reduced operating income comparisons to fiscal these negative impacts on operating income were partially offset by lower dda expense million and lower exploration expense million compared to the previous year the following table summarizes hedges in

production taxes mcfe due to higher market prices and lower hedge percentages net realized prices increased in fiscal the increase in the dda rate was caused by production mix and the addition of unproven capital and costs associated with the development of both proven and unproven reserves on february the company announced that it had acquired certain oil and gas properties in eastern texas northern louisiana and mississippi from will drill for approximately million the acquired properties virtually all of which are now operated by the company consist of approximately gross acres in fields in the heart of the cotton valley travis peak hosston gas trend the acquisition initially added approximately mmcfed to existing production and an estimated bcfe of proven reserves approximately of the acquired reserves are developed the will drill acquisition added mmcfed to the annual average production the company expects to spend approximately million of drilling capital on the acquired properties in fiscal during april the company acquired properties in south texas for approximately million although there was minimal production at the time of acquisition these properties are providing current and future drilling opportunities on july the company acquired certain oil and gas properties in eastern texas from a private entity for approximately million initial development of the acquired reserves began in fiscal with capital spending on these properties totaling million the acquired properties which are operated by the company are located in close proximity to the existing peoples energy production holdings in eastern texas on december the company acquired through a series of transactions certain oil and gas properties located in texas for approximately million the acquired reserves of which are natural gas contributed approximately mmcfe per day of production to the companys fiscal production the majority of the acquired properties are located adjacent to or in close proximity to existing holdings of the company and each of the acquired properties is operated by the company energy marketing segment revenues for fiscal increased million primarily due to higher commodity prices partially offset by a decline in gas volumes sold operating income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal energy marketings margins can be volatile and are small in relation to the market value of the commodity as a result revenue statistics are not necessarily indicative of energy marketing operating income results retail results declined from a year ago due primarily to locom and mtm accounting adjustments of energy contracts the impact of which was magnified by a significant decline in the market price of natural gas during the latter half of september as well as higher operating expenses partially due to higher sales and marketing expenses associated with customer growth lower retail results were partially offset by higher wholesale marketing results reflecting additional pipeline and storage capacity under contract and the positive impact of price volatility and spreads on storage and transportation optimization strategies partially offset by locom adjustments and mtm accounting for the year the number of retail customers increased approximately from a year ago to almost as energy marketing expanded its customer base in michigan and ohio retail gas deliveries declined slightly to bcf while electric deliveries increased to million mwh from million mwh a year ago locom inventory loss adjustments million fair value hedge accounting losses million ineffectiveness gains million and mtm accounting gains million resulted in an unrealized loss for the energy marketing segment of million for fiscal this net unrealized loss includes both mtm activity of hedges for settlement in future periods and settled within the current period as well as locom inventory loss adjustments that are expected to reverse when the gas inventory is sold pursuant to existing contracts approximately million of the year end impact net is expected to reverse over the course of the next fiscal year and relates primarily to the locom adjustment of million the earnings variability resulting from accounting timing can be significant from period to period even when the underlying economic position is unchanged the company uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the profit margin that it will ultimately realize when inventory volumes are withdrawn from storage under fair value hedge accounting which energy marketing is using for certain storage activity the mtm adjustment to inventory is computed using spot prices while the derivatives used to mitigate the risk of changes in inventory value are marked to market using forward prices when the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price the difference is recorded in operating results as a result earnings are subject to volatility even when the underlying expected profit margin over the duration of the contracts is unchanged the volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period revenues for fiscal increased million primarily due to higher retail and wholesale commodity prices and volumes operating income improved million driven by higher retail margins higher load and lower operating costs partially offset by a million mtm loss related to the application of fair value hedge accounting to certain storage inventory transactions the following table summarizes operating statistics for the energy marketing segment for fiscal years ended september in thousands except customers wholesale gas volumes sold mdth retail gas volumes sold dth number of retail gas customers retail electric volumes sold mwh number of electric customers energy assets segment all financial results relating to power generation formerly included in this business segment are now reported as discontinued operations including prior year results operating income for the energy assets segment reflects the companys natural gas liquids ngl peaking facility a mile refinery gas pipeline acres of land and related facilities and certain limited business development expenses related to ongoing asset investment opportunities revenues for fiscal increased million primarily due to higher commodity prices and increased volumes associated with activity at the companys propane based peaking facility fiscal operating income of million was flat compared to fiscal discontinued operations the company announced in february its intention to exit the power generation business on january the company sold its interest in the valencia energy power development site in new mexico on may the company completed the sale of its interest in the scep facility to exelon generation company llc on september the company announced that it signed an agreement with j power to sell its interest in the elwood power generation facility and its interest in a fully permitted power development site the cob energy facility cob for million subject to certain closing adjustments these sales will complete the divestiture of substantially all power assets owned by peoples energy the board of directors of j powers parent company approved the transactions on november financial results for power generation are now being reported by peoples energy as discontinued operations through elwood and cob the company owned approximately net megawatts of power generation assets fiscal income from discontinued operations for the energy assets segment decreased million before taxes due to the absence of equity investment income from scep and the million loss on the sale of the valencia development site partially offset by the million gain on the sale of scep amortization of capitalized interest related to the construction of the elwood power generation facility was formerly included in the corporate and other segment fiscal income from discontinued operations for the energy assets segment increased million before taxes from the prior year largely as a result of lower depreciation expense impact on equity investment income for the elwood facility and lower other expenses in connection with its fiscal year end audit the elwood partnership determined that depreciation expense related to current and prior periods should be adjusted primarily to recognize greater salvage value of its generating equipment this adjustment positively impacted fiscal results by million of which million related to prior periods the electric capacity of elwood energy llc elwood has been sold through long term contracts with exelon generation company llc exelon engage energy america llc engage and aquila inc aquila effective december the contract with engage terminated and the related electric capacity is being purchased by exelon on june aquila assigned its elwood power sales agreement to constellation energy commodities group inc a subsidiary of constellation energy group inc in august sp and moodys ratings on elwoods bonds were upgraded to bb and ba respectively with a stable outlook corporate and other segment the operating loss for fiscal increased million and includes of merger related expenses results for fiscal included million in restructuring charges absent these costs corporate and other expenses increased million due primarily to a million gain in fiscal associated with the sale of certain assets by trigen peoples district energy of which peoples energy owned a interest and higher legal million and incentive benefit expenses million the operating loss for fiscal decreased million primarily due to direct labor savings of million as a result of the restructuring the million gain resulting from the sale of the trigen peoples district heating and cooling plant and a million decrease in costs resulting from the organizational restructuring critical accounting policies in preparing the companys financial statements using gaap management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles including making estimates and assumptions management considers its critical accounting policies to be those that are important to the representation of the companys financial condition and results of operations they require managements most difficult and subjective or complex judgments including those that could result in materially different amounts if the company reported under different conditions or using different assumptions the company discusses its critical accounting policies as well as other accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee as appropriate there were no material changes in the application of each of the critical accounting policies listed below during fiscal see note o of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements regulated operations due to the regulation of the companys utility subsidiaries certain transactions are recorded based on the accounting prescribed in sfas no regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain incurred costs that will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers accordingly actions of the commission could have an effect on the amount recovered from or refunded to customers any differences between recoverable and refundable amounts and the amounts deferred would be recorded as income or expense at the time of any commission action see notes c and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the gas charge settlement if all or a reportable portion of the utility operations becomes no longer subject to the provision of sfas no a write off of related regulatory assets or liabilities would be required unless some form of transition cost recovery continued through rates established and collected for the remaining regulated operations no such change is foreseen by management see note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of regulatory assets and liabilities recorded under this policy environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas operations the companys utility subsidiaries their predecessors and certain former affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple sites for the purpose of manufacturing gas and storing manufactured gas manufactured gas sites the utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs they incur in connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas sites pending recovery through rates or from other entities the amounts deferred include costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and managements best estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites managements estimates are based upon a probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative and remedial costs management considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs and the extent of recovery from other prps see notes k and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for deferred environmental costs recorded as regulatory assets and a discussion of environmental matters retirement and postretirement benefits the calculation of pension expense relies on actuarial assumptions including discount rate long term rate of return on assets and assumed future increases in compensation these assumptions are determined annually and changes to the assumptions can have a material effect on the amounts recorded from year to year the company bases its discount rate assumption on yields of high quality long term fixed income bonds a decrease in the assumed discount rate of basis points would have increased fiscal pension expense by million additionally when an employee retires and takes hisher retirement benefit as a lump sum a settlement amount under sfas no is calculated representing a portion of unrecognized gains and losses the company has chosen to record this amount in the current period instead of amortizing the difference over the expected average service life of the remaining participants both methods are acceptable under gaap therefore the timing of retirements can have an effect on the amount recorded in any given year see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for current year assumptions in addition the company and its subsidiaries currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees substantially all employees may become eligible for such benefit coverage if they reach retirement age while working for the company through the use of an independent actuary the company accrues the expected costs of such benefits during a portion of the employees years of service this accrual is based on assumptions regarding discount rates rate of return on assets and health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point for each future year would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at september by million and the aggregate of service and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by million annually decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point for each future year would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at september by million and the aggregate of service and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by million annually a decrease in the assumed discount rate of basis points would have increased postretirement benefit cost expense by million see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for current year assumptions derivative instruments and hedging activities the company enters into financial derivative contracts to hedge price risk on natural gas and oil purchases and sales for each contract management must determine whether the underlying transaction qualifies as a hedge under derivative accounting rules prescribed in sfas no if contracts do qualify as hedges they have the effect of reducing but not completely eliminating volatility in earnings for contracts not qualifying as hedges the change in the fair value of these contracts is recorded in income monthly and results in potentially significant impacts both positive and negative additionally due to the nature of the companys businesses many of the companys contracts for physical purchases and sales of gas oil or power meet the definition of a derivative but are exempt from derivative accounting requirements under the normal purchases and sales exemption under this exemption if the transactions are clearly intended to meet the requirements of customers mtm accounting is not required management judgment is required to make this determination the application of hedge accounting and the normal purchase and sales exemption is also subject to contemporaneous documentation requirements under sfas no the company also manages its levels of floating and fixed rate interest payments within a specified range through the use of derivative financial instruments see note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys cash flow and fair value hedging strategies and the mtm derivative instruments provision for uncollectible accounts the companys subsidiaries accrue for estimated uncollectible accounts as revenues are recorded the accrual rates are established based upon historical experience and projections of future charge offs resulting from various factors including the impacts of natural gas prices and weather each quarter the companys subsidiaries update the projection of future charge offs based upon the most current information available and adjust the reserve for uncollectible accounts if necessary depreciation depletion and amortization the companys provision for depreciation at peoples gas and north shore gas substantially reflects the systematic amortization of the original cost of depreciable property net of the accumulated reserve for depreciation over the estimated composite remaining useful lives on the straight line method additionally actual dismantling cost net of salvage is recorded as depreciation expense in the month incurred the depreciation rates of peoples gas and north shore gas are subject to periodic review by the commission which approves the depreciation rates used for rate making purposes diversified businesses depreciable properties other than oil and gas producing properties are amortized over their estimated useful lives in the case of oil and gas producing properties the company is amortizing associated capitalized costs by utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting on the units of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves the successful efforts method provides for properties to be aggregated into cost centers or pools with depreciation depletion and amortization calculated on a pool by pool basis these pools are comprised of properties in an area that share the same general geological characteristics unit of production amortization rates and the aggregation of properties into pools are reviewed at least once a year or whenever there is an indication of the need for revision those revisions are accounted for prospectively as changes in accounting estimates acquisition costs are amortized over total proved reserves development costs are amortized over total proved developed reserves costs to be amortized include all capitalized costs less accumulated amortization and estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects are excluded from the amortization base these costs and resulting proved reserves are transferred into the amortization base or expensed at the point when a determination can be made about the projects success see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for supplemental disclosures of the companys oil and gas production segment recent accounting pronouncements see note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements liquidity and capital resources

settlement refund see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and other factors described above under results of operations partially offset by favorable net changes in working capital in the accompanying cash flow statements balance sheet changes in current deferred tax assets gas in storage and deposits with broker or trustee exclude certain noncash transactions primarily the effects of mtm accounting changes in gas in storage reflect lower of cost or market adjustments additionally balance sheet changes in intercompany assetsliabilities of peoples gas and north shore gas exclude the noncash effects of derivative activity conducted on their behalf by peoples energy net cash used in investing activities increased as a result of an increase in capital spending primarily in the oil and gas production segment on february the company announced that it had acquired certain oil and gas properties in eastern texas northern louisiana and mississippi from will drill for approximately million increases in the return of capital from the companys equity method investments primarily related to the sale of properties by the enervest partnership and the trigen peoples partnership as well as through the sale of the companys interest in the scep facility which resulted in proceeds of approximately million were largely offset by an increase in deposits associated with the companys commodity hedging activities net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to additional commercial paper borrowing million in fiscal partially related to the oil and gas production segment acquisition compared to commercial paper retirement million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities for fiscal increased due to favorable net changes in working capital net cash used in investing activities in fiscal decreased compared to as a result of decreased capital spending primarily in the oil and gas production segment offset by an increase in deposits associated with the companys commodity hedging activities driven by price declines and ratings downgrades on company long term debt the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal compared to was primarily due to increased retirements of commercial paper lower amounts of debt issued net of retirements and to lower amounts of common stock issued under the continuous equity program and the ltic plan in fiscal compared to fiscal see the consolidated statements of cash flows and the discussion of major balance sheet variations below for more detail balance sheet variations total assets at september increased million as compared to september due to additional capital investment in the oil and gas production segment resulting from the will drill acquisition increases in current regulatory assets related primarily to mtm accounting for the utility gas costs hedging program and increases in noncurrent regulatory assets and capital investments in the gas distribution segment resulting from the recognition of asset retirement obligations required under fin these increases were partially offset by decreases in derivative assets that are marked to market and largely relate to utility hedge activity the decrease in derivative assets reflects price declines during fiscal relative to utility supply contracts long positions current liabilities increased due to additional levels of commercial paper outstanding primarily due to the oil and gas properties acquisition and an increase in gas costs refundable through rate adjustments partially offset by a decrease in accrued taxes due to lower taxable income and by a decrease in regulatory liabilities largely corresponding with the above decrease in derivative assets that are marked to market settlement of these assets is included as an adjustment to gas costs included in customer bills deferred credits and other liabilities increased due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations required under fin the increase in the companys capitalization was the result of the combined decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss and increase in common stock primarily issued through the direct purchase and investment plan and the ltic plans partially offset by the reduction in retained earnings due primarily to the million after tax charge related to the gas charge settlement and dividend payments of million the decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects both price declines related to short position derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges at the companys oil and gas production and energy marketing segments and a net decrease in derivative positions at the oil and gas production segment financial sources the company and peoples gas have access to outside capital markets commercial paper markets and internal sources of funds that together provide sufficient resources to meet their working capital and long term capital requirements north shore gas has access to outside capital markets to meet long term capital requirements and uses internal sources of funds and loans from the company and peoples gas to meet working capital needs changes that could materially alter its liquidity position include the effect of high gas prices on utility working capital and on hedge related margin requirements for the upcoming heating season the company maintains lines of credit facilities to ensure sufficient liquidity for seasonal working capital requirements and other short term financial needs as forecasts of liquidity change throughout the year due to high gas prices for example the company may seek additional sources of liquidity in order to meet its objectives due to the seasonal nature of gas usage a major portion of the utilities cash collections occurs between january and june because of timing differences in the receipt and disbursement of cash and the level of construction requirements the utility subsidiaries borrow from time to time on a short term basis short term borrowings are repaid with cash from operations or other short term borrowings or are refinanced on a permanent basis with debt or equity depending on market conditions and capital structure considerations in addition to cash generated internally by operations as of september the company and its subsidiaries had committed credit facilities of million peoples energy million peoples gas million these facilities primarily support the companys and peoples gas ability to borrow using commercial paper as of september million of peoples energys million line and all of peoples gas million facilities were available the peoples energy million credit agreement expires in june and the peoples gas million credit agreement expires in july the long term credit facilities are expected to be renewed when they expire although the exact amount of the renewals will be evaluated at that time and may change from the current levels north shore gas intends to meet its future short term borrowing requirements through loans from peoples energy or peoples gas the companys and peoples gas credit facilities generally contain debt triggers that permit the lenders to terminate the credit commitments to the borrowing company and declare any outstanding amounts due and payable if the borrowing companys consolidated debt to total capital ratio excluding the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci exceeds at september the companys total debt was of total debt plus equity excluding aoci up from a year ago due primarily to the impacts of the settlement charge and the will drill oil and gas acquisition anticipated proceeds from the sale of the companys remaining power generation assets by calendar year end will be used to reduce short term borrowing the current debt to total capital ratio for peoples gas is excluding aoci management does not expect the gas reconciliation settlement to have a material adverse affect on the companys liquidity or its ability to fund its strategic initiatives and capital expenditures in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above the company has uncommitted lines of credit and letters of credit backup of million of which million was used for letters of credit backup and million was unused as of september peoples gas and north shore have the ability to loan up to million between the two utilities and to borrow up to million and million respectively from peoples energy as of september there were no loans from peoples energy to peoples gas or north shore gas as of september there were no loans between peoples gas and north shore gas the current credit ratings for the company peoples gas and north shore gas are summarized in the table

compared with the prior year lower weather normalized demand million and the impact of the change in the regulatory treatment of hub revenues million due to the gas charge settlement agreement the million decrease in operating income for fiscal was primarily due to the million charge related to the amended settlement of the gas charge proceedings higher operation and maintenance expense million the change in treatment of hub revenues million lower deliveries resulting from warmer weather million and lower normalized deliveries million the increase in operation and maintenance expense was due to higher labor pension group insurance bad debt outside services and rate case expenses these increases were partially offset by the impact of the fiscal restructuring related pension charge of million interest expense for peoples gas for fiscal increased million due to higher interest rates and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate adjustments fiscal revenues for peoples gas increased million from the previous period the main reason for the increase was the impact on revenues of higher gas prices million partially offsetting these effects were lower revenues resulting from a decrease in deliveries due to weather million that was warmer than the previous period and a decrease in normalized deliveries gaap operating income increased million from fiscal operating income was favorably impacted by decreased labor costs related to the organizational restructuring million and a decrease in depreciation expense million primarily due to the commission depreciation order negative impacts on results include lower deliveries resulting from warmer weather million fiscal interest expense for peoples gas increased million over fiscal primarily due to

hedging program an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets and capital investments related to the recognition of asset retirement obligations required under fin an increase in cash and cash equivalents an increase in gas in storage due to higher prices and volume and an increase in prepaid pension costs due to the elimination of the additional minimum pension liability as a result of increased plan funding and an increase in the discount rate these increases were partially offset by a decrease in intercompany receivables due to of a decrease in derivative assets contracted by peoples energy on behalf of peoples gas that are marked to market the decrease in derivative assets reflects price declines during fiscal relative to utility supply contracts long positions the increase in current liabilities was driven by an increase in intercompany payables made up largely of unrealized losses on derivatives contracted by peoples energy on behalf of peoples gas that are

instruments including commodity futures contracts swaps and options it is the policy of the company to use these instruments solely for the purpose of managing risk and not for any speculative purpose derivative summary the following table summarizes the changes in valuation of all outstanding derivative contracts during fiscal and all amounts are based on fair values at the end of the period and do not necessarily indicate that a gain or loss on the derivative will be recognized in income in future periods generally hedges are held to maturity which coincides with recognition of the transaction being hedged eg anticipated sales or cost of purchases in income thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies derivative type cash flow fair value hedges hedges mark to market in thousands value of contracts outstanding at october loss on contracts discontinued as cash flow hedges less gain loss on contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year plus unrealized gain loss on new contracts entered into during the period and outstanding at year end plus other unrealized gain loss primarily changes in market prices on contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year value of contracts outstanding at september the change in the value of derivative contracts for the fiscal year ended september was due primarily to the dramatic change in the forward price curve of natural gas over this same period the increase in the value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges was driven primarily by the effect of lower forward prices and a reduction of hedged volumes in the oil and gas production segments derivatives portfolio the increase in the value of contracts designated as fair value hedges was driven primarily by an increase in value in the energy marketing segments storage optimization portfolio partially offset by the decrease in value of the companys floating rate interest rate swap reflecting the rise in short term interest rates the primary cause of the decrease in the value of contracts designated as mtm is attributable to the impact of the change in the forward price curve on the derivative instruments of peoples gas and north shore gas used to manage each utilitys cost of gas supply this was partially offset by the positive impact of changes in prices on mtm portfolios at the energy marketing segment for the fiscal year ended september unrealized losses on contracts attributed to peoples gas and north shore gas were million and million respectively sfas no allows for these mtm derivative gains and losses to be recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities realized gains and losses are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of gas supply in the period that the underlying gas purchase transaction takes place the costs and benefits of this activity are passed through to customers under the tariffs of peoples gas and north shore gas the following table is a summary of the fair market value of commodity derivatives by type at september valuations are based on the nymex closing prices for the respective nymex henry hub futures contracts and on the closing

reserves natural gas and transportation as part of its oil and gas production and energy marketing businesses and related to its company use gas in the gas distribution segment the company uses derivative financial instruments to protect against loss of value of future anticipated cash transactions sales and purchases caused by changes in the marketplace these instruments are designated cash flow hedges which allow for the effective portion of unrealized changes in value during the life of the hedge to be recorded in other comprehensive income realized gains and losses from cash flow hedges are recorded in the statement of operations in the same month the related physical sales and purchases and interest expense are recorded cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions will occur the carrying value of contracts which no longer qualify for hedge accounting are prospectively marked to market with the change in value recorded in the statement of operations if the original forecasted transactions are probable of not occurring any amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income are immediately recorded in the statement of operations hedge ineffectiveness can result from differences in critical terms such as location between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction and result in the immediate recognition of gains or losses fair value hedges the company uses financial and physical hedges to protect the value of a portion of energy marketings gas in storage and these are accounted for as fair value hedges the change in value of these hedges and the change in value of the inventory hedged are expected to largely offset in each reporting period in the statement of operations during the years ended september and the energy marketing segment recorded mtm losses of million and million respectively related to the application of fair value hedge accounting to certain storage inventory transactions the energy marketing segment uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the profit margin that it will ultimately realize when inventory volumes are withdrawn from storage under fair value accounting which is used for certain storage activity the mtm adjustment to inventory is computed using spot prices while the derivatives used to mitigate the risk of changes in inventory value are marked to market using forward prices when the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price the difference is recorded in operating results as a result earnings are subject to volatility even when the underlying expected profit margin over the duration of the contracts is unchanged the volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period a portion of this accounting loss will reverse next year if the volumes are withdrawn from storage at september gas inventory hedged using fair value accounting at energy marketing had a fair value of million including mtm decreases in inventory totaling million for changes in spot prices derivative assets totaling million were recorded for the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge this inventory at september hedged gas inventory at energy marketing had a fair value of million including mtm increases in inventory totaling million for changes in spot prices derivative liabilities totaling million were recorded for the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge this inventory the company also uses certain financial instruments to adjust the portfolio composition of its debt from fixed rate to floating rate debt these derivative instruments are accounted for as fair value hedges and are not material to the companys financial condition or results of operations the change in value of these hedges along with the offsetting change in value of the debt hedged to the extent the hedge is effective are recorded in each reporting period in interest expense in the statement of operations mark to market derivative instruments peoples gas and north shore gas use derivative instruments to manage each utilitys cost of gas supply and mitigate price volatility all such derivative instruments are measured at fair value the regulated utilities tariffs allow for full recovery from their customers of prudently incurred gas supply costs including gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a result sfas no allows these mtm derivative gains or losses to be recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities realized gains or losses are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of gas supply in the period that the underlying gas purchase transaction takes place the costs and benefits of this activity are passed through to customers under the tariffs of peoples gas and north shore gas the energy marketing segment uses certain derivative contracts such as nymex or basis swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no included in these contracts are hedges of location differentials associated with its wholesale natural gas contracts and transactions involving storage assets in the fiscal year ended september the energy marketing segment recognized mtm pretax gains losses included in revenues of million related to these derivatives as physical volumes are delivered under natural gas contracts or withdrawn under certain gas storage contracts these mtm accounting impacts are reversed the above amounts include net mtm activity both for hedges for settlement in future periods and the reversal of amounts recorded in prior periods and settled within the current period the following table summarizes the market value of these outstanding instruments and other derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and are recorded on a mtm basis all amounts are expected to be settled during the next months september in thousands peoples gas mark to market asset liability north shore gas mark to market asset liability other mark to market asset liability total weather risk the companys gas distribution earnings vary due to the warmth or severity of the weather the company has managed this risk through the purchase of weather insurance and the use of block rates in utility rate design block rates help mitigate the effect of warm weather by allowing greater cost recovery on the first volumes through the meter and less on the last volumes the insurance in place for fiscal was provided by a subsidiary of xl america inc and protected the company for a portion of lost revenue incurred when weather was more than warmer than normal in fiscal the company recognized as additional revenues million in insurance recoveries no weather insurance was purchased for fiscal as the company views the current market pricing for this product as excessive relative to the risk it would protect against the energy marketing business segment can also be affected by weather variations storage swing supply and weather derivatives are used or are available to protect earnings and ensure performance interest rate risk the company uses interest rate derivatives to adjust the portfolio composition of fixed rate and floating rate debt and it accounts for these derivatives as fair value hedges in august the company entered into a six month libor based interest rate swap agreement on million of its million series a notes due january under this agreement the company will receive the fixed price of and pay six month libor plus a defined spread on the notional amount of million the payments will reset on the th day of each january and july until maturity of the series a notes credit risk the company has established a credit policy to mitigate the effect of nonperformance on wholesale transactions pursuant to this policy a credit limit is established for all counterparties based on a review of their financial condition the company reviews and changes when necessary its credit underwriting and monitoring procedures the company has adequate financial assurance provisions in its commercial agreements that permit the company to call for credit support when warranted action may include the calling of collateral adjusting credit lines changing payment terms or reducing future business in addition netting arrangements and requirements to post margin are used to further reduce credit exposure credit risk for the utility companies is spread over a diversified base of residential commercial and industrial customers customers payment records are continually monitored and credit deposits are required when appropriate
