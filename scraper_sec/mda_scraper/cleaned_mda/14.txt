contribution from affiliate products in fiscal cost of revenues decrease increase dollars in thousands cost of revenues gross profit the companys cost of revenues includes all costs of media manuals duplication packaging materials assembly and freight in addition royalties are included in cost of revenues the companys gross profit is affected by the mix of sales among products that are developed or licensed by maxis and affiliate partner products that are developed by third parties and distributed by the company gross profit and operating expenses are significantly lower for affiliate partner products because the companys services are generally limited to sales distribution and related functions the decrease in gross profit percentage from fiscal to fiscal was due to several factors during fiscal the company derived a higher percentage of net revenues from game console products due primarily to sales of simcity for the playstation the percentage of revenues from game consoles was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal cost of goods sold generally is higher for game console products than for pc based maxis products also during the third quarter of fiscal the company commenced shipments in germany under a new distribution arrangement the arrangement requires payment of fixed sellingdistribution fees and customer discounts generally resulting in lower gross margins in

prices for some of its older products finally the company included sales premiums in its initial shipments of four sim branded titles released in the third quarter of thereby increasing the cost of goods sold for these products the increase in gross profit percentage from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a greater mix of products with lower royalty rates the companys gross profit percentage

by the mix of sales among products that are developed or licensed by maxis and affiliate partner products that are developed by third parties and distributed by the company as well as other factors during fiscal the company expects gross profit to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis and further expects significantly lower gross profit in the first and second fiscal quarters relative to

development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct the companys development efforts and to fund third party software development costs third party software development costs include advanced product development payments which are expensed as paid the company believes that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive and has therefore consistently increased the absolute amount of spending for research and development research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to added expenses incurred for the development of new products and additional personnel and related costs as well as relatively lower net revenues in fiscal also operating costs related to cinematronics llc were included in the companys results of operations for all of fiscal there were no such costs prior to fiscal because the company acquired cinematronics llc in march research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal remained relatively unchanged during fiscal the company intends to

subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility based on the companys product development process technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model costs

advertising trade shows and marketing programs with customers sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal due to relatively lower net revenues in fiscal from fiscal to fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues remained relatively unchanged competition for retail shelf space is extremely competitive as well as increasingly costly therefore in order to continue to distinguish the company and its products in the marketplace the company expects to continue aggressive marketing and sales programs consequently the company expects

increased staffing and related costs necessary to support the companys operations general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal due to relatively

looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of including but not limited to statements regarding the companys potential for future success the revenue potential of international markets and game consoles gross profit and net income on a quarterly basis the level of affiliated product revenues research and development expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses the anticipated effective income tax rate future capital expenditures and the companys ability to satisfy its liquidity and working capital requirements of the next year actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in operating results due to a variety of factors including the size and rate of growth of the consumer software market market acceptance of the companys products and those of its competitors development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new products or new versions of existing products seasonality projected and actual changes in computing platforms the timing and success of product introductions product returns changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations the companys operating results also may fluctuate significantly due to changes in product plans or delays in completing and shipping products for example in july the company discontinued the development of the mindwarp an action game scheduled to ship during fiscal in connection with this decision the company closed its utah development office in mid november the company released simcopter approximately one month later than originally planned due to the importance of the holiday buying season the delay in shipping simcopter resulted in a significant shortfall in the companys anticipated revenues for the quarter and fiscal year such risks apply to all of the companys products under development simcity its successor sim city and related add on products represented of net revenues of maxis for fiscal and of net revenues for fiscal maxis originally planned to release the follow on product to simcity in march but has deferred the introduction until fiscal failure to ship simcity for the calendar holiday season would have a material adverse effect on the operating results of maxis during the current fiscal year and in particular the third fiscal quarter sales to a limited number of distributors and retailers have constituted and are anticipated to continue to constitute a substantial majority of the companys net revenues the loss of or significant reduction in sales attributable to any of the companys principal distributors or retailers could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition distribution and retailing businesses in the computer industry from time to time have experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and there have been a number of business failures among such entities for example neostar a retailer with over retail stores filed for chapter bankruptcy in september in connection with this event the company incurred expenses for bad debt of in fiscal although the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers the insolvency or business failure of any significant distributor or retailer of the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition the consumer software business is highly seasonal net revenues typically are significantly higher during the third fiscal quarter due primarily to the increased demand for consumer software during the calendar year end holiday buying season net revenues in other quarters generally are lower and vary significantly as a result of new product introductions and other factors the company expects its net revenues and operating results to continue to reflect significant seasonality there can be no assurance that the company will achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis the companys success depends on the timely introduction of successful new products to replace declining revenues from older products in response to competitive pressures maxis may take certain pricing and or marketing actions the company has in the past and will likely in the future reduce the price of older products and offer promotions to extend the life cycle of its products such actions could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition the company may be required to pay fees in advance or to guarantee royalties which may be substantial to obtain licenses to intellectual properties from third parties before products incorporating such properties have been introduced or have achieved market acceptance products generally are shipped as orders are received and accordingly the company operates with little backlog the companys expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future sales and as a result operating results would be disproportionately adversely affected by a decrease in sales or a failure to meet the companys sales expectations defective products may result in higher customer support costs and product returns the companys gross profit is affected by the mix of sales among products that are developed or licensed by the company and products that are developed by third party affiliate partners and distributed by the company gross profit and operating expenses are significantly lower on affiliate partner products because the companys services with respect to such products generally are limited to sales distribution and related functions the company evaluated the market for affiliate products and effective in fiscal decided to scale down its affiliate program the company consequently terminated all but one of its affiliate partners while the company is contractually obligated to distribute products for terminated affiliates until december certain affiliates may elect to discontinue their business with maxis sooner because of this change in its affiliate program the company expects a substantially reduced amount of net revenues from affiliate products in fiscal the market price of the companys common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results as well as other factors such as announcements of new products by the company or its competitors and changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or other events the extreme volatility of the stock market has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and prices have often been disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies broad market fluctuations as well as economic conditions in general and in the software industry in particular may adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock the announcement of the merger of maxis with electronic arts may increase the likelihood of a number of changes to maxis business any of which could have a material adverse effect such changes include but are not limited to loss of key management development or other personnel deterioration of customer relationships returns of product in excess of normal returns reduction or cessation of orders for products or cancellation of agreements by distributors of the maxis product line certain of which have already communicated their intention to take all or some of such actions confusion of potential buyers of maxis products and delays in product development and diminution of the sim brand if the merger were not completed for any reason maxis could be materially adversely affected by such changes and restoring the maxis business to its pre announcement value could require a substantial period of time require significant expenditures or prove impossible as a result of the factors described above the failure to consummate the merger for any reason could have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results financial condition and stock trading price
