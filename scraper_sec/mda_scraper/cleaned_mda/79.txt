amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period in applying accounting principles management must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties the actual results of outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts these differences are usually insignificant and are included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known the estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from these estimates property and equipment is stated at cost depreciation for financial reporting purposes is being provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for leasehold improvements this depreciation is over the shorter of the effective term of the related lease approximately five years

may not be recoverable historically impairment losses on fixed assets have not been material to the companys financial position and results of operations insurance liability for workers compensation automobile and general liability may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these estimates because of the period over which actual results may emerge such risk is mitigated by managements ability to make changes to these estimates as they occur an estimate is recorded for the future lease obligation related to closed stores based upon the present value of the future minimum lease payments and related lease commitments net of estimated sublease income these estimates may be adjusted for lease terminations in which the company negotiates an amount with the landlord to terminate the lease prior to lease expiration also estimated sublease reserves offsetting the obligation may become uncollectible management

company has elected to use the modified prospective method of adoption of sfas r for periods after october the impact of adoption of sfas r will depend on levels of share based compensation granted in the future if the company had adopted sfas r in prior periods the expense recognized would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required this new requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase by the same amount net financing cash flows in periods after adoption in december
