the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect the companys future plans estimates beliefs and expected performance the forward looking statements are dependent upon events risks and uncertainties that may be outside the companys control the companys actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to market prices for natural gas and oil economic and competitive conditions regulatory changes capital expenditures and other uncertainties as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report particularly in item a risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of all of which are difficult to predict in light of these risks uncertainties and assumptions the forward looking events discussed may not occur overview the company is a natural gas and oil well services company that provides cased hole wireline and well intervention services to ep companies the companys wireline services focus on cased hole wireline operations including logging services perforating mechanical services pipe recovery and plugging and abandoning the well the companys well intervention services are primarily hydraulic workover services commonly known as snubbing services all of the companys services are performed at the well site and are fundamental to establishing and maintaining the flow of natural gas and oil throughout the productive life of the well the companys results of operations are affected primarily by the extent of utilization and rates paid for its wireline and well intervention services which is dependent upon the upstream spending by the natural gas and oil exploration and production companies that comprise its client base the company derives a majority of its revenues from services supporting production from existing natural gas and oil operations demand for these production related services is less volatile than drilling related services and tends to remain relatively stable even in lower natural gas and oil price environments as ongoing maintenance spending is required to sustain production as natural gas and oil prices reach higher levels demand for the companys production related services generally increases as its customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase natural gas and oil production from those wells because some of the companys services are required to support drilling activities the company is subject to changes in capital spending by its customers as natural gas and oil prices increase or decrease the company showed improvement in its revenues during and over and as a result of the increased natural gas and oil drilling and workover activity during those years as a result of the bobcat acquisition which represents the companys introduction into the well intervention services business the company currently operates in two business segments wireline services and well intervention services the companys wireline segment includes the business conducted by warrior energy prior to the bobcat acquisition and its well intervention segment includes the business conducted by bobcat post acquisition revenues the majority of the companys revenues are generated from major and large independent natural gas and oil companies the primary factor influencing demand for the companys services by those customers is their level of drilling and workover activity which in turn depends primarily on the availability of drilling and workover prospects and current and anticipated future natural gas and oil commodity prices and production depletion rates back to contents the companys services are generally provided at a price based on bids submitted which in turn are based on the companys current pricing equipment and crew availability and customer location and the nature of the service to be provided these services are routinely provided to the companys customers and are subject to the customers time schedule weather conditions availability of the companys personnel and complexity of the operation the companys wireline services generally take one to three days to perform while its well intervention services generally take two weeks or longer to perform service revenues are recognized at the time services are performed the company generally charges for its wireline services on a per well entry basis and its well intervention services on a day rate basis depending on the specific service a per well entry or day rate may include one or more of these components a set up charge an hourly service rate based on equipment and labor an equipment rental charge a consumables charge and a mileage and fuel charge the company determines the rates charged through a competitive bid process on a job by job basis or for larger customers the company may negotiate on an annual basis typically work is performed on a call out basis whereby the customer requests services on a job specific basis but does not guarantee work levels beyond the specific job bid during the years ended december and december approximately and respectively of the companys revenues were derived from onshore activities and approximately and respectively of the companys revenues were derived from offshore activities cost and expenses operating costs the companys operating costs are comprised primarily of labor expenses repair and maintenance material and fuel and insurance in a competitive labor market in the industry it is possible that the company will have to raise wage rates to attract workers and retain or expand its current work force the company believes it will be able to increase service rates to its customers to compensate for wage rate increases the company also incurs costs to employ personnel to sell and supervise its services and perform maintenance on its fleet these costs are not directly tied to the companys level of business activity because the company seeks to retain its experienced and well qualified employees during cyclical downturns in its business and is required to pay severance under employment agreements that cover a portion of its workforce the company expects labor expenses to increase as a percentage of revenues during future cyclical downturns repair and maintenance is performed by the companys crews company maintenance personnel and outside service providers increases in the companys material and fuel costs are frequently passed on to its customers however due to the timing of the companys marketing and bidding cycles there is generally a delay of several weeks or months from the time that it incurs an actual price increase until the time that the company can pass on that increase to its customers insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and relates to the number of rigs trucks skids snubbing units and other equipment in the companys fleet employee payroll and safety record selling general and administrative expenses the companys selling general and administrative expenses include administrative marketing employee compensation and related benefits office and lease expenses insurance costs and professional fees as well as other costs and expenses not directly related to field operations the companys management regularly evaluates the level of the companys general and administrative expenses in relation to its revenue because these expenses have a direct impact on the companys profitability the company expects to incur additional expense in future periods relating to incentive compensation paid to employees success bonus and change of control payments the company expects to make change of control and success bonus payments in the aggregate amount of million to certain key employees immediately prior to or concurrently with the closing of the companys proposed public offering of shares of its common stock back to contents interest expense interest expense consists of interest associated with the companys revolving line of credit term loan convertible notes and other debt as described in the notes to the companys financial statements contained elsewhere in this report as a result of the companys proposed public offering the company expects that when the proposed offering is completed and the net proceeds are applied to the intended uses its debt levels will be substantially lower than their current levels which resulted from the acquisition of bobcat on december the company also expects that its effective borrowing rate will be substantially less than that associated with the outstanding convertible subordinated debt intended to be converted to equity in connection with the proposed public offering accordingly subsequent to the proposed public offering interest expense is expected to be substantially lower than the levels of interest expense following the companys acquisition of bobcat there can be no assurance that the proposed public offering will be completed interest income primarily consists of interest earned on the companys cash balances depreciation expense the companys depreciation expense is based on estimates assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs useful lives and salvage values of the companys assets the company generally computes depreciation using the straight line method income taxes at december the company had approximately million of net operating losses nols available to offset future taxable income these nols will be applied to taxable income in prior to the companys proposed public offering and will be subject to additional irs section limitations subsequent to the companys proposed public offering

participated with mr underbrink in actions the plaintiffs allege were fraudulent and constituted securities violations the company has not concluded that it is probable that a claim will be asserted against it and it does not believe that if a claim is asserted that there is a reasonable possibility that the outcome would be unfavorable to the company or that any resulting liability would be material to its financial condition in the companys view the allegations in the complaint and amended complaint relating to it are baseless without factual foundation and untrue recently issued accounting pronouncements on december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp fas application of fasb statement no accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of was issued fsp fas clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with statement as such the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment rather the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the companys tax return beginning in in december the fasb issued sfas revised share based payment sfas no r this statement requires that the costs of employee share based payments be measured at fair value on the awards grant date using an option pricing model and recognized in the financial statements over the requisite service period this statement does not change the accounting for stock ownership plans which are subject to american institute of certified public accountants sop employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans statement r supersedes opinion accounting for stock issued to employees and its related interpretations and eliminates the alternative to use opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting which the company is currently using certain stock awards may be considered liabilities instead of equity components under sfas no r sfas no r allows for two alternative transition methods the first method is the modified prospective application whereby compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date will be recognized over the remaining service period the compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no as originally issued all new awards and awards that are modified repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date will be accounted for under the provisions of sfas no r the second method is the modified retrospective application which requires that the company restate prior period financial statements the modified back to contents retrospective application may be applied either to all prior periods or only to prior interim periods in the year of adoption of this statement the company adopted the modified prospective application method on january and does not expect a material impact on its financial statements in november the fasb issued sfas no inventory costs an amendment of arb no chapter which is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june the amendments made by sfas no will improve financial reporting by clarifying that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the adoption of statement did not have a significant effect on the companys financial statements in december the fasb issued interpretation no revised december fin r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb the primary objectives of fin r are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine if a business enterprise should consolidate the vies this new model for consolidation applies to an entity for which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties in addition fin r requires that all enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures regarding their relationship with the vie the interpretation requires public entities to apply fin r to all entities that are considered special purpose entities in practice and under the fasb literature that was applied before the issuance of fin r the adoption of fin r had no effect on the companys financial statements inflation the companys revenues have been and are expected to continue to be affected by fluctuations in the prices for natural gas and oil inflation did not have a significant effect on its operations in significant accounting policies the companys discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an on going basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to the allowance for bad debts inventory long lived assets intangibles and goodwill the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions allowance for doubtful accounts the companys allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at an amount equal to estimated losses in its accounts receivable the company continually monitors the accounts receivable from its customers for any collectability issues an allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on reviews of individual customer accounts recent loss experience current economic conditions and other pertinent factors accounts deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance provisions for bad debts and recoveries on accounts previously charged off are added to the allowance all accounts outstanding more than days are considered past due long lived assets in accordance with sfas no accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets the company recognizes impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows over the life of the assets are less than the assets carrying amount if an impairment exists the amount of such impairment is calculated back to contents based on projections of future discounted cash flows these projections use a discount rate and terminal value multiple that would be customary for evaluating current natural gas and oil services company transactions goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is stated at cost the company implemented sfas no goodwill and other intangible assets on january and ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets sfas no requires an assessment of potential impairment upon adoption and annually thereafter in the month it elected to perform its analysis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred intangible assets are stated at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives intangible assets are subject to an assessment of potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred the company considers external factors in making its assessment specifically changes in oil prices and other economic conditions surrounding the industry consolidation within the industry competition from other natural gas and oil well services providers the ability to employ and maintain a skilled workforce and other pertinent factors are among the factors that could lead its management to reassess the reliability of its goodwill and intangible assets property and equipment property and equipment are carried at original cost less applicable depreciation depreciation is recognized on the straight line basis over lives ranging from two to ten years major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over each assets estimated remaining useful life maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred when assets are sold or retired the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income property and equipment held and used by the company is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected assets to determine the recoverability of carrying amounts revenue recognition the company derives revenues from performance of services and the sale of equipment service revenues are recognized at the time services are performed the companys sales are not usually subject to rights of return and historically sales returns have not been significant revenue related to equipment sales is recognized when the equipment has been shipped and title and risk of loss has been passed to the customer deferred revenue net of deferred related cost of sales is recorded as unearned revenues in the companys balance sheet based on the relative days completed on the job to total required income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements or tax returns in estimating future tax consequences the company generally considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from time to time the company holds financial instruments comprised of debt securities and time deposits all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale the company does not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading or hedging purposes the companys debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in its business and operations the company manages these funds accordingly the company seeks reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the back to contents same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return its market risk exposure consists of exposure to changes in interest rates and to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers the company typically invest in investment grade securities with a term of three years or less the company believes that any exposure to interest rate risk is not material at december the company held no investments under the companys credit agreements with gecc it is subject to market risk exposure related to changes in the prime interest rate assuming the companys level of borrowings from gecc at december remained unchanged throughout if a basis point increase in interest rates under the credit agreements from rates in existence at december prevailed throughout the year it would increase the companys interest expense by approximately the foregoing does not give effect to any repayment of outstanding indebtedness under the companys credit agreements out of the net proceeds it may realize in its proposed public offering
