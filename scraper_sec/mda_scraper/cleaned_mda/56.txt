to dpls consolidated financial statements aes ohio generation now only has operating activity coming from its undivided ownership interest in conesville which does not meet the threshold to be a separate reportable operating segment because of this dpl now manages its business through only one reportable operating segment the utility segment the primary segment performance measure is income loss from continuing operations before income tax as management has concluded that this measure best reflects the underlying business performance of dpl and is the most relevant measure considered in dpls internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments the utility segment is discussed further below utility segmentthe utility segment is comprised primarily of dpls electric transmission and distribution businesses which distribute electricity to residential commercial industrial and governmental customers dpl distributes electricity to more than retail customers who are located in a square mile area of west central ohio dpls electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators accordingly dpl applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses and records regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs the utility segment includes revenues and costs associated with our investment in ovec and the historical results of dpls beckjord facility which was closed in and transferred to a third party in the first quarter of and the hutchings egu which was closed in these assets did not transfer to aes ohio generation as part of dpls generation separation on october thus they are grouped within the utility segment for segment reporting purposes in addition regulatory deferrals and

disclosure as reportable segments as well as certain corporate costs which include interest expense on dpls long term debt and adjustments related to purchase accounting from the merger dpls undivided interest in conesville is now included within the other column as it no longer meets the requirement for disclosure as a reportable operating segment since the results of operations of the other

additional guidance such changes may be materiallower tax rate the corporate tax rate decreased from percent to percent beginning in in addition to deferred tax remeasurement impacts the lower tax rate resulted in the recognition at december of a regulatory liability at dpl the regulatory liability reflects deferred taxes that will flow back to ratepayers over time for further details see

notes to dpls financial statements we have concluded our analysis of the implementation impacts of the tcja and included adjustments to our previous estimates in accordance with the guidance of sab limitation on interest expense deductions the tcja introduced a new limitation on the deductibility of net interest expense beginning january the deduction is limited to interest income plus percent of tax basis ebitda through percent of ebit beginning january this determination is made at the table of contentsconsolidated group level the limitation does not apply to interest expense attributable to regulated utility property the us treasury department and internal revenue service have released proposed regulations to clarify how the exception will apply to regulated utility holding companies these proposed regulations are prospective we have not adopted them for cost recovery the tcja amended depreciation rules to provide full expensing bonus depreciation for assets that commence construction and are placed in service before january this provision is phased down by percent ratably through the immediate full expensing provision is elective but it does not apply to regulated utility property this change is not expected to impact our effective tax rate however if elected it could impact taxable income and cash taxes in future periodsstate taxes the reactions of the individual states to federal tax reform is still evolving these state and municipalities will assess whether and how the federal changes will be incorporated into their tax legislationon january the puco initiated a proceeding to consider the impacts of the tcja to determine the appropriate course of action to pass benefits resulting from the legislation on to ratepayers the puco also directed ohio utilities to record deferred liabilities for the estimated reduction in federal income tax resulting from the tcja beginning january under the terms of the esp dpl will not make tax sharing

related disclosure of contingent liabilities these assumptions estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain our significant accounting policies are described in note overview and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to dpls

examination by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcome of tax examinations when determining the adequacy of our income tax provisions by considering the technical merits of the filing position case law and results of previous tax examinations accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement requirements for financial statement reporting of our income tax positions tax reserves have been established which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments once established reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves while we believe that the amount of the tax reserves is reasonable it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amountsdeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realizedregulatory assets and liabilitiesapplication of the provisions of gaap relating to regulatory accounting requires us to reflect the effect of rate regulation in dpls consolidated financial statements and dpls financial statements for regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost of service rate regulation regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by non regulated companies when it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers we defer these costs as regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by non regulated companies likewise we recognize regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates and when revenue is collected from customers for expenses that are not yet incurred regulatory assets are amortized into expense and regulatory liabilities are amortized into income over the recovery period authorized by the regulatorwe evaluate our regulatory assets to determine whether or not they are probable of recovery through future rates and make various assumptions in our analyses the expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities if recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable it will be expensed in the period the assessment is made we currently believe the recovery of our regulatory assets is probable see note

components of previously recorded depreciation related to the cost of removal of assets upon future retirement whether legal aros or not must be removed from a companys accumulated depreciation reserve and be reclassified as a regulatory liability we make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses as they relate to aros these

recoverability using future cash flows we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates future economic conditions assignment of discount rates and estimates of

interpretation of the tcja may change as the us treasury department and the internal revenue service issue additional guidance such changes may be materiallower tax rate the corporate tax rate

limitation on the deductibility of net interest expense beginning january the deduction is limited to interest income plus percent of tax basis ebitda through percent of ebit beginning january this determination is made at the table of contentsconsolidated group level the limitation does not apply to interest expense attributable to regulated utility property the us treasury department and internal revenue service have released proposed regulations to clarify how the exception will apply to regulated utility holding companies these proposed regulations are prospective we have not adopted them for cost recovery the tcja amended depreciation rules to provide full expensing bonus depreciation for assets that commence construction and are placed in service before january this provision is phased down by percent ratably through the immediate full expensing provision is elective but it does not apply to regulated utility property this change is not expected to impact our

statements and dpls financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in connection with the preparation of these financial statements our management is required to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities these assumptions estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain our significant accounting policies are described in note overview and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to dpls consolidated financial statements and note overview and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to dpls financial statementsdifferent estimates could have a material effect on our financial results judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result

assessed on and collected from customers which are remitted to the governmental authoritiesincome taxeswe are subject to federal and state income taxes our income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcome of tax examinations when determining the adequacy of our income tax provisions by considering the technical merits of the filing position case law and results of previous tax examinations accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement requirements for financial statement reporting of our income tax positions tax reserves have been established which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments once established reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves while we believe that the amount of the tax reserves is reasonable it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amountsdeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realizedregulatory assets and liabilitiesapplication of the provisions of gaap relating to regulatory accounting requires us to reflect the effect of rate regulation in dpls consolidated financial statements and dpls financial statements for regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost of service rate regulation regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by non regulated companies when it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers we defer these costs as regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by non regulated companies likewise we recognize regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates and when revenue is collected from customers for expenses that are not yet incurred regulatory assets are amortized into expense and regulatory liabilities are amortized into income over the recovery period authorized by the regulatorwe evaluate our regulatory assets to determine whether or not they are probable of recovery through future rates and make various assumptions in our analyses the expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities if recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable it will be expensed in the period the assessment is made we currently believe the recovery of our regulatory assets is probable see note regulatory matters of notes to dpls consolidated financial statements and note regulatory matters of notes to dpls financial statementsarosin accordance with the provisions of gaap relating to the accounting for aros legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets are required to be recognized at their fair value at the time those obligations are incurred upon initial recognition of a legal liability costs are capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset these gaap provisions also require that components of previously recorded depreciation related to the cost of removal of assets upon future retirement whether legal aros or not must be removed from a companys accumulated depreciation reserve and be reclassified as a regulatory liability we make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses

disposal group we determine the fair value of these assets based upon estimates of future cash flows market value of similar assets if available or independent appraisals if required in analyzing the fair value and recoverability using future cash flows we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates future economic conditions assignment of discount rates and estimates of terminal values an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows the measurement of impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the assetpension and postretirement benefitswe account for and disclose pension and postemployment benefits in accordance with the

assets that otherwise would be expensed by non regulated companies likewise we recognize regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates and when revenue is collected from customers for expenses that are not yet incurred regulatory assets are amortized into expense and regulatory liabilities are amortized into income over the recovery period authorized by the regulatorwe evaluate our regulatory assets to determine whether or not they are probable of recovery through future rates and make various assumptions in our analyses the expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities if recovery of a
