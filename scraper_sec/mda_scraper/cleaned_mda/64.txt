item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide a suite of integrated pressure control and related services to onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration and development companies principally in north america south america north africa west africa the middle east and asia including training contingency planning well plan reviews audits inspection services engineering services pressure control equipment rental services hydraulic snubbing workovers well completions and plugging and abandonment services table of contents on march we acquired the hydraulic well control business hwc of oil states international inc as a result of the acquisition we acquired the ability to provide hydraulic units for emergency well control situations and various well intervention solutions involving workovers well drilling well completions and plugging and abandonment services hydraulic units may be used for both routine and emergency well control situations in the oil and gas industry a hydraulic unit is a specially designed rig used for moving tubulars in and out of a wellbore using hydraulic pressure these units may also be used for snubbing operations to service wells under pressure when a unit is snubbing it is pushing pipe or tubulars into the wellbore against wellbore pressures on july we acquired rock springs wyoming based stassco pressure control llc stassco and the transaction was effective for accounting and financial purposes as of august stassco operates four hydraulic rig assist units in the cheyenne basin wyoming and its presence in the rockies is a key to our strategy to expand north america land operations we added our pressure control equipment rental service line to our suite of pressure control services during the fourth quarter of our pressure control equipment and operating personnel are utilized primarily during the drilling and completion phases of oil and gas wells we are currently operating this business in our north america regions classified as the gulf of mexico mid continent and southeast and our middle east international region we plan to expand into other operating areas where we provide pressure control services on february we purchased john wright company jwc for approximately million in a combination of cash and subordinated debt based in houston jwc provides a suite of relief well drilling and risk management services to the oil and gas industry worldwide we are integrating the companys proprietary technology into our safeguard program which is currently our fastest growing service line demand for services depends on factors beyond our control including the volume and type of drilling and workover activity which is substantially influenced by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices wars acts of terrorism and other unpredictable factors may affect demand for our services on a regional basis demand for our emergency well control or critical well event services is volatile and inherently unpredictable as a result we expect to experience large fluctuations in our revenues from these services non critical services included in our well intervention segment while subject to typical industry volatility associated with commodity prices drilling activity levels and the like provide more stable revenues and our strategy continues to be to expand these product and service offerings while focusing on our core strength of pressure control services results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information contained in our periodic reports previously filed with the securities and exchange commission and incorporated herein by reference our summary consolidated operating results for the fiscal years ended december and were years ended december in thousands revenues costs and expenses cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative other operating expense depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense other income and expense net income tax expense net income table of contents we operate in three business segments pressure control well intervention and equipment services intercompany transfers between segments were not material our accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies while cost of sales expenses are variable based upon the type of revenue generated most of our operating expenses represent fixed costs for base labor charges rent and utilities for purposes of this presentation operating expenses and depreciation and amortization have been charged to each segment based upon specific identification of expenses and a pro rata allocation of remaining non segment specific expenses are assigned between segments based upon relative revenues selling general and administrat ive and corporate expenses have been allocated between segments in proportion to their relative revenue business segment operating data from continuing operations is presented for purposes of management discussion and analysis of operating results the pressure control segment consists of personnel equipment and services which are designed to reduce the number and severity of critical well events offered through our prevention and risk management programs including training contingency planning well plan reviews audits inspection services and engineering services this segment also consists of personnel equipment and services provided during a critical well event these services can include snubbing and equipment services rental equipment provided during a response which are designed to minimize response time and mitigate damage while maximizing safety these services primarily utilize existing personnel to maximize utilization with only slight increases in fixed operating costs our well intervention segment consists of services that are designed to enhance production for oil and gas operators and reduce the number and severity of critical well events such as oil and gas well fires blowouts or other losses of control at the well this segment includes services performed by hydraulic workover and snubbing units that are used to enhance production of oil and gas wells these units are used for underbalanced drilling workover well completions and plugging and abandonment services the equipment services segment includes our pressure control equipment rental and service business which began as an expansion of the companys existing services in we expect our equipment services segment to continue to benefit as a result of cross selling of our other services by our business development team and our expanded geographic presence information concerning operations in our three different business segments for the years ended december and is presented below certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods to conform to the current presentation year ended december in thousands revenues pressure control well

and includes foreign currency translation table of contents comparison of the year ended december with the year ended december revenues pressure control revenues were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december representing a decrease of or in the current year the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in response revenue partially offset by an increase in international revenue from prevention and risk management projects in north africa and asia well intervention revenues were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december representing a decrease of or in the current year the decrease was primarily due to the a project in bangladesh that added million in revenue in fiscal year the suspension of operations in venezuela for most of the first and second quarters of reduced business in the middle east the loss of a tender in egypt and a slowdown in the most of our north american regions in the current year we experienced revenue increases in algeria and the northeast and southeast regions of north america as well as from the commencement of operations in north africa equipment service revenues were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year this increase is due to the increase in capital used to expand our equipment rental and services business cost of sales pressure control cost of sales was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year for the year ended december cost of sales represented of revenues compared to of revenues for the year ended december the increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of revenue being associated with third party costs primarily due to a project in india in well intervention cost of sales was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december a decrease of or in the current year for the year ended december cost of sales represented of revenues compared to of revenues for the year ended december the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to carrying costs associated with our operations in venezuela during our suspension of operations there equipment services cost of sales was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year for the current year cost of sales was of revenue compared to of revenue in the prior year the cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decrease was primarily due to a lower proportion of revenue with third party costs in in relation to as the asset base for the service line increased operating expenses consolidated operating expenses were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year during the current year operating expenses represented of revenues compared to of revenues in the prior year the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in employment costs as we continued to add personnel to pursue opportunities to grow our geographic presence and product offerings the increases were partially offset by decreases in bonus accruals and bad debt expense selling general and administrative expenses consolidated selling general and administrative sga expenses were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an decrease of or in the current year during the year ended december sga expense represented of consolidated revenues compared to of revenues in the prior year the increase in total sga expense was primarily due to increases in professional fees and employment costs which were partially offset by decreases in bonus accruals and advertising and customer relations expenses table of contents depreciation and amortization consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased by or between the years ended december and the increase was primarily due to the depreciation increase of resulting from an increase in capitalized assets in the remaining increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of john wright company in february those intangible assets consist of trade name non compete agreement proprietary software process diagrams and customer relationships being amortized over to year periods other intangible assets are related to the stassco purchase and consist of customer relationships being amortized over a year period and management non compete agreements being amortized over and year periods interest expense interest expense increased by in the year ended december compared to the prior year period this includes for the increase in amortization of deferred financing charges resulting from the new syndicated credit agreement we entered into in february and the required write off of of the remaining deferred financing charges related to the previous loan the remaining increase was primarily a result of higher borrowings in the current year period other income and expense net other income and expenses increased by in the year ended december compared to the prior year period the increase was primarily a result of a decrease in interest income income tax expense income taxes for the year ended december were or of pre tax income compared to income taxes for the year ended december of or of pre tax income the companys estimated annual effective tax rate reflects among other items our best estimates of operating results and foreign currency exchange rates a change in the mix of pretax income from these various jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the companys effective tax rate our effective tax rate was adversely impacted by consolidating foreign losses from certain tax jurisdictions which do not generate future tax benefits comparison of the year ended december with the year ended december revenues pressure control revenues were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december representing an increase of or in the current year the largest increase resulted from revenue of from a prevention and risk management international project which was completed in the fourth quarter the remaining increase was primarily due to a higher level of international emergency response activity well intervention revenues were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december representing an increase of or in the current year the increase was due to higher utilization resulting from growth in our domestic and international hydraulic workover and snubbing services equipment service revenues were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year this increase is due to the domestic and international expansion of our equipment rental and services which began in august cost of sales pressure control cost of sales was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year for the year ended december cost of sales represented of revenues compared to of revenues for the year ended december the percentage increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of revenue with related third party costs in in relation to well intervention cost of sales was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year for the year ended december cost of sales represented of revenues compared to of revenues for the year ended december the increase in cost of sales is generally attributable to the increased revenue volume table of contents equipment services cost of sales was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year for the current year cost of sales was of revenue compared to of revenue in the prior year the percentage increase was primarily due to being more fully operational in as contrasted with a higher component of start up costs incurred in operating expenses consolidated operating expenses were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year during the current year operating expenses represented of revenues compared to of revenues in the prior year the increase in operating expenses on an actual basis was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits incentive bonus bad debt expense travel and entertainment tools and supplies and professional fees as a result of the geographic expansion of all segments and the ramp up of our pressure control equipment rental services business operating expenses were also lower in due to a gain on disposal of assets during the year which did not recur in the year ended december # the percentage of revenue decrease is primarily due to higher revenues in relation to increases in expenses due to the component of such expenses that are fixed and semi fixed selling general and administrative expenses consolidated selling general and administrative sga expenses were for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december an increase of or in the current year during the year ended december sga expense represented of consolidated revenues compared to of revenues in the prior year the increase in actual sga expense is primarily due to higher salaries incentive bonus benefits and marketing related expenses associated with the higher level of revenues and operating income exceeding plan depreciation and amortization consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased by or between the years ended december and the increase was primarily due to the depreciation increase of resulting from an increase in capitalized assets in additionally amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of stassco pressure control llc in august for the full year in compared to five months in was and respectively the intangible assets consist of customer relationships being amortized over a year period and management non compete agreements being amortized over and year periods interest expense interest expenses decreased by in the year ended december compared to the prior year period the interest expense decrease was primarily due to a lower average interest rate and a lower balance on our term loan borrowings offset by an increase in our average revolver balance other income and expense net other income and expenses increased by in the year ended december compared to the prior year period the net expense increase was primarily a result of the decrease in interest income of from the prior year period which was due to a reduction in funds available for investment in income tax expense income taxes for the year ended december were or of pre tax income compared to the year ended december of or of pre tax income we determined that as a result of the acquisition of hwc we have experienced a change of control pursuant to limitations set forth in section of the irs rules and regulations as a result we are limited to utilizing approximately million of us net operating losses nol to offset us taxable income generated during the tax year ended december and expect similar dollar limits in future years until our us nols are either completely used or expire in the tax expense as a percent of pretax income was lower due to taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the us and a tax benefit related to the utilization of future net operating losses nols against taxable income in future years which was partially offset by estimated uncertain penalty and interest all us current tax expense was offset by utilization of nols and foreign tax credits table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december we had working capital of compared to at december our cash balance at december was compared to at december we ended the year with stockholders equity of which increased by when compared to at december primarily due to our net income of for the year ended december our primary liquidity needs are to fund working capital capital expenditures such as expanding our equipment services fleet of equipment and replacing support equipment for our hydraulic workover and snubbing service line debt service and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity are cash cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility we generated cash from operating activities in fiscal year of compared to in cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of non cash charges of and decreases in receivables of non cash charges were comprised primarily of of depreciation and amortization stock based compensation of bad debt provision of and excess tax expense of that were offset by a reduction due to a deferred tax credit of these positive cash flows were offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of increases in other assets of increases in inventory of a gain on saledisposal of assets of and increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of receivables decreased due to more timely collections primarily from our foreign customers accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased primarily due to reductions in accrued compensation and foreign income taxes other assets increased primarily due to deferred financing charges related to the new credit agreement and due to prepaid agent commissions inventory increased as a result of supporting future operations and prepaid expenses and other current assets increased primarily due to an increase in insurance cost cash used in investing activities during the years ended december and was and respectively capital expenditures totaled and during the years ended december and respectively capital expenditures in consisted of purchases of assets for our hydraulic workover and snubbing services and our rental equipment services the acquisition of the abrasive jet cutting systems and the acquisition of john wright company jwc while our capital expenditures were primarily purchases of assets for our hydraulic workover and snubbing services and our rental equipment services during the year ended december we realized insurance proceeds of on a claim related to one of our hydraulic workover units and portions of its auxiliary equipment and inventory that fell from a third party freight vessel into the sea off the coast of libya the insurance proceeds were used for replacement of equipment and inventory this claim resulted in a gain on disposal of assets totaling in the current year on july we acquired rock springs wyoming based stassco pressure control llc stassco for cash consideration of net of cash acquired and including transaction costs but excluding a payable to the former owners of this transaction was funded utilizing cash proceeds available from our underwritten public offering of common stock in april stassco performed snubbing services in the cheyenne basin wyoming and operated four hydraulic rig assist units on february we acquired houston based john wright company jwc for cash consideration of net of cash acquired and issued a promissory note to john w wright for this transaction was funded utilizing cash obtained under our new credit facility our net cash generated from financing activities was for the year ended december primarily as a result of the new credit facility entered into on february which generated proceeds of net of pay down of on our previous credit facility and repayment of all of related party debt we generated net cash of from financing activities for the year ended december primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility of on december we had cash of denominated in bolivares fuertes and residing in a venezuelan bank and venezuela trade accounts receivables owing from the countrys national oil companies of including denominated in bolivares fuertes and denominated in us dollars of which is settled in bolivares fuertes and is settled in usdollars the us dollar settled amount includes recorded on a cash basis and is classified as deferred revenue the venezuelan trade accounts receivable is down considerably from the exposure we had at march when we temporarily suspended operations due to our concern over our total working capital exposure in venezuela table of contents the table below shows the amounts of venezuela trade accounts receivables as of march in relation to the amounts of those same receivables uncollected as of june september and december march june september december bolivares fuertes us dollar denominated settled in bolivares fuertes us dollar denominated settled in us dollars total as of december we had net working capital exposure of including denominated in bolivares fuertes and denominated in us dollars our venezuelan operations currently fund liquidity needs from the working capital that is generated by venezuelan operations our international operations give rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that transactions are not denominated in us dollars we typically endeavor to denominate all of our contracts in us dollars to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and we partially do this in venezuela the venezuelan government implemented a foreign currency control regime on february this has resulted in currency controls that restrict the conversion of the venezuelan currency the bolivar fuerte to us dollars the company has registered with the control board cadivi in order to have a portion of total receivables in us dollar payments made directly to a united states bank account effective january and related to our acquisition of the hydraulic well control business of oil states we changed our functional currency in venezuela from the venezuelan bolivar to the us dollar this change allowed us to have one consistent functional currency after the acquisition accumulated other comprehensive loss reported in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity before january totaled million and consisted solely of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in venezuela prior to changing our functional currency the currency translation adjustment recorded up through the date of the change in functional currency will only be adjusted in the event of a full or partial disposition of our investment in venezuela the security and exchange commission regulation committees international practices task forces center for audit quality has deemed venezuelas currency as hyperinflationary effective january effective january the venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure the official exchange rate moved from to for essential goods and to for non essential goods and services the estimated unfavorable impact of the devaluation to the companys first quarter results is approximately with the exchange rate movement from to the future results of our venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors including our ability to take actions to mitigate the effect of the devaluation further actions of the venezuelan government and general economic conditions such as continued inflation and future customer payments and spending credit facilitiescapital resources on march we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association which established a revolving credit facility capacity totaling million and a term credit facility totaling million the loan balance outstanding on december was million on the term credit facility and million on the revolving credit facility this line was replaced with a new facility described below on february we entered into a new million syndicated credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association royal bank of canada and bank of america na the credit agreement the credit agreement replaced our existing term and revolving credit facilities the credit agreement provides for a term loan in the principal amount of million and a revolving credit line in the principal amount of up to million the term loan facility requires regularly scheduled quarterly payments of principal and interest quarterly principal payments on the term facility are million and commenced june amounts repaid under the term loan cannot be re borrowed the term loan and the revolving credit line each mature on february the loan balance outstan ding on december was million on the term credit facility and million on the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility borrowing base was million at december adjusted for million outstanding under letters of credit and guarantees leaving million available to be drawn under the facility table of contents interest under the credit agreement accrues at a base rate which is the greatest of the federal funds rate plus wells fargos prime rate or the daily one month london interbank offered rate plus plus a margin ranging from to per annum or at our option at a eurodollar base rate plus a margin ranging from to per annum we will also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit line ranging from to per annum the commitment fee and the margin applicable to advances under the credit agreement increase within the applicable range if the ratio of our debt to adjusted ebitda rises above the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term credit facility at december was and respectively the credit agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by all of our current and future domestic subsidiaries collectively the guarantors and secured by substantially all of our assets and those of the guarantors including a pledge of all of the capital stock of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries we have not entered into any interest rate hedges with respect to the credit agreement but may elect to do so in the future the credit agreement contains covenants that limit our ability and the guarantors ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends on or repurchase stock make certain types of investments sell stock of our subsidiaries restrict dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets merge with other companies and spend in excess of million per year on capital expenditures the credit agreement also requires compliance with certain financial covenants including the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth of not less than of our tangible net worth as of march plus an amount equal to of consolidated net income for each succeeding fiscal quarter plus of future net proceeds from the sale of equity securities a maximum ratio of funded debt to adjusted ebitda for the preceding four fiscal quarters of to and a minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges of to we are in compliance with these covenants as of december and expect to be in compliance for the next twelve months we utilized initial borrowings of approximately million under the credit agreement to repay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit facilities repay all of the million of senior subordinated notes held by oil states international and to fund our purchase of john wright company we believe that cash on hand cash from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the coming twelve months disclosure of on and off balance sheet debts and commitments our known contractual obligations at december are reflected in the table below future commitments s description total year years years thereafter long and short term debt and notes payable term loan revolving credit facility subordinated debt capital lease payments including interest future minimum lease payments total commitments off balance sheet arrangements as of december we had no off balance sheet arrangements table of contents critical accounting policies in response to the secs release no cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial statements by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessment we have identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts share based compensation and income taxes revenue recognition revenue is recognized on our service contracts primarily on the basis of contractual day rates as the work is completed revenue and cost from product and equipment sales is recognized upon customer acceptance and contract completion revenue excludes taxes assessed based on revenue such as sales or value added taxes effective june the company began deferring for the portion of venezuela service revenue to be settled in us dollars and those amounts will be recognized as revenue when earned and cash is collected at december the amount of defe rred revenue related to vz services was and is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we recognize revenues under the wellsure program as follows a initial deposits for pre event type services are recognized ratably over the life of the contract period typically twelve months b revenues and billings for pre event type services provided are recognized when the insurance carrier has billed the operator and the revenues become determinable and c revenues and billings for contracting and event services are recognized based upon our predetermined day rates and sub contracted work as incurred wellsure revenues represented approximately of our total revenues for the years ended december and cost of sale cost of sales includes all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor related workmans compensation insurance supplies tools repairs and depreciation costs operating expense includes costs related to service line management and support including business development and delivery expenses general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral we assess our credit risk and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for any accounts which we deem doubtful of collection share based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant and for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees consultants and directors including employee stock options based on estimated fair values fair value of financial instruments the companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents receivables payables and debt the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short term nature of those instruments and because debt is at a floating rate we use available market rates to estimate the fair value of debt which approximated the carrying value at december goodwill goodwill is not being amortized but is being reviewed at least annually for impairment or more often if changes in facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred goodwill is associated with the march acquisition of the hydraulic well control business hwc of oil states international inc the july acquisition of stassco pressure control llc stassco and the february acquisition of the john wright company and as is further described in note e the goodwill for the hwc and stassco acquisitions have been assigned to the well intervention segment and the goodwill for the john wright acquisition has been assigned to the pressure control segment # these segments are deemed the reporting units for this review fair values of the reporting units are determined based on internal management estimates using a combination of discounted cash flows and market comparable companies we perform the annual reviews for possible impairment in the fourth calendar quarter of each year and the impairment testing consists of a two step process the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and utilizes a future cash flow analysis based on the estimates and assumptions of our forecasted long term growth model if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares th e implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying amount for and and no goodwill impairment was recognized based on the evaluations performed at december and table of contents income taxes we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and use an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns we apply the following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law and the effects of potential future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered and the value of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence are not expected to be realized we determine deferred taxes separately for each tax paying component an entity or a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each tax jurisdiction that determination includes the following procedures identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences measuring the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate measuring the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax rate measuring the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward and reducing the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized our primary deferred tax assets at december are related to million in available federal net operating loss carry forwards nols net of expiring losses and million of foreign tax credits the foreign tax credits will expire in the nols will expire in varying amounts during the years through if they are not first used to offset taxable income that we generate our ability to utilize a significant portion of the available nols are currently limited due to a change in control that occurred during as of december we have three years of nol for which we do not have a valuation allowance we believe that the companys forecasted taxable income during the next three years will allow us to utilize those nols the remaining years nols hav e a full valuation allowance we will continue to monitor this in future periods and adjust the allowance accordingly our methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment in the use of assumptions and estimates additionally we use forecasts of certain tax elements such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results unforeseen events may significantly impact these variables and changes to these variables could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to our continuing operations our income tax provision for the year ended december totaled million or of pretax income our income tax provision for the year ended december totaled million or of pretax income table of contents we have operations in jurisdictions other than the united states consequently we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities the income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases including income actually earned income deemed earned and revenue based tax withholding the final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction changes in the operating environment including changes in tax law and currencyrepatriation controls could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year tax filings of our subsidiaries unconsolidated affiliates and related entities are subject to examination in the normal course of business by tax authorities these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process predicting the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty factors such as the availability of settlement procedures willingness of tax authorities to negotiate and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to current accounting standards which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold and measurement meth odology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements they also provide guidance for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition we account for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold for a tax position before being recognized in the financial statements the company evaluated all tax years still subject to potential audit under state federal and foreign income tax law in reaching its accounting conclusions the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense tax years subsequent to remain open to examination by us federal and state tax jurisdictions tax years subsequent to remain open in venezuela tax years subsequent to remain open in algeria tax tears subsequent to remain open in the congo and tax years subsequent to for libya during the company recorded a charge of relating t o unrecognized tax benefits the company recorded a charge of and for the tax years ending december and respectively recent accounting pronouncements on january the company adopted changes issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb to fair value accounting and reporting as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis these changes define fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expand disclosures about fair value measurements this guidance applies to other gaap that require or permit fair value measurements and is to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions the adoption of these changes as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities had no impact on the consolidated financial statements these provisions will be applied at such time a fair value measurement of a nonfinancia l asset or nonfinancial liability is required which may result in a fair value that is materially different than would have been calculated prior to the adoption of these changes effective january the company adopted changes issued by the fasb on april to accounting for business combinations these changes apply to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from certain contingencies and requires i an acquirer to recognize at fair value at the acquisition date an asset acquired or liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period otherwise the asset or liability should be recognized at the acquisition date if certain defined criteria are met ii contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination be recognized initially at fair value iii subsequent measurements of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies be based on a systematic and rational method depending on their nature and contingent consideration arrangements be measured subsequently and iv disclosures of the amounts and measurement basis of such assets and liabilities and the nature of the contingencies these changes were applied to the acquisition completed on february see note e overall the adoption of this change did not have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations on january the company adopted changes issued by the fasb to consolidation accounting and reporting these changes establish accounting and reporting for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary this guidance defines a non controlling interest previously called a minority interest as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent these changes require among other items that a non controlling interest be included in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity separate from the parents equity consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parents and non controlling interests shares and separately the amounts of consolidated net income
