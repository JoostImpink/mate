item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview founded in atmi generates revenues from product sales and contract research most product sales are point of use environmental equipment specialty materials and delivery systems for the semiconductor industry atmi also receives royalties for certain product sales from third parties since a significant portion of atmis revenues has come from contracts with united states government agencies the programs in which atmi participates may extend for several years but are usually funded annually there can be no assurance that the government will continue its commitment to programs to which atmis development projects are applicable or that atmi can compete successfully to obtain program funding atmi has used a targeted acquisition strategy to assist in building critical mass and market position in the niches the company serves in atmi acquired vector and in conjunction with the sale of novapure product lines to millipore in september formed ecosys by merging the retained operations of novapure with those of vector in atmi acquired the guardian product line from messer greisheim industries and folded that product line into ecosys in atmi acquired epitronics corporation and in early combined that business with the formerly known diamond electronics division under the epitronics name the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship to total revenues of certain items in atmis consolidated statement of operations year ended

december products revenues cost of revenues gross profit contracts revenues cost of revenues gross profit results of operations years ended december and revenues in atmis total revenues improved to approximately from in total revenues for were greater than s product sales were up in from s product sales of product sales for were of atmis total revenues and in in turn showed a increase above product sales of in product sales in were of atmis total revenues ecosys effluent treatment product sales led atmis product revenue growth with its technology leadership and full service philosophy in the environmental niche of the semiconductor market ecosys managed to increase market share in the face of a softening capital equipment market sales to pacific rim based companies continued to be strong the december acquisition of the guardian product line was also responsible for a portion of the revenue growth this year sales of effluent gas treatment products were approximately of atmis revenues about last year ecosys contributed about of revenues in of atmis total sales were ecosys product sales while not a significant factor to date a continued slowdown in capital equipment spending in the semiconductor industry could have a negative effect on ecosys revenue growth during the sds product line has begun to have a significant impact on the companys revenue growth the revenue from this product line changed in late from a royalty stream to a product revenue steam as a result the sale of this product represented approximately of total revenues in up from for the entire years revenues general increases in government funding of atmi research resulted in the growth of contract revenues for government funding grew to from in and increased in from in the increased research funding in was primarily focused on materials development device processing and device design activities within novamos and epitronics the growth was primarily related to increased funding of substrate fabrication and materials development projects gross profit atmis gross profit improved this year by to compared to when gross profit of had grown from in as a percentage of revenues gross profit improved to in from in and increased in from in in atmis sales mix continued to shift toward greater volumes of high margin products consequently our product revenue gross margin improved to from in and increased in from in product gross margin improved to of revenues up from in and in the improved product margins in were attributed primarily to the significant increases in royalties in connection with sds product line growth additionally sales of the sds product commenced late in the year when the company began manufacturing the product and recognized margins higher than the average atmi product margin the effect of the sds more than offset some slight declines in margin realized on sale of ecosys products due to geographic and product mix shifts to comparatively lower margin sales gross profit on contract revenue increased in by to from in which was an increase of over at gross margin on contracts over the last three years have remained relatively stable as a percent of contract revenues gross margin increased to in from in which was a decrease from in contract margins can vary slightly from year to year based on the mix of cost type firm fixed price and cost share arrangements additionally different fee arrangements and indirect cost absorption can contribute to some margin variability research and development expenses atmi targets areas to maintain its competitive advantage for our rd spending rose significantly to up from last year primary drivers for the increase in was expansion of product development efforts within ecosys and increased spending to expand and protect the sds technology portfolio rd expenses of in was an increase of from rd of rd as a percentage of revenues has increased to in compared with in which was a decrease from of revenues in selling general and administrative expenses increasing in line with atmis growth atmis variable selling costs grew in atmi also added administrative staff in to support revenue growth and

was due again to variable selling cost increases and also to the expansion of the companys marketing staff sga as a percentage of revenues has decreased to in compared with in which was a slight increase from of revenues in other income net most of atmis other income stems from interest income offset by interest expense on the companys outstanding debt in net other income grew by to the companys invested cash balances throughout were significantly higher than in due to the companys public offering in october increased interest expense in partially offset the effect of the increased interest earned on cash investments in net other income of grew by from the amount of exclusive of s non recurring transactions again the interest income growth was due to having the proceeds of the october offering for the last quarter of the year the non recurring transaction involved the restructuring of the novapure joint venture and the sale of assets for a million gain offsetting this gain were transaction and consolidation expenses of million for the restructuring acquiring vector and combining vector and novapure into ecosys income taxes atmis income tax expense related primarily to state taxes on income generated partially offset by the utilization of loss carryforwards and available state tax credits minimal federal taxes paid in and related to alternative minimum taxes arising from the use of net operating loss carryforwards income tax expense in was up from the in which in turn were up from in liquidity and capital resources the year was atmis first in generating cash from operations net cash generated of was due principally to the increased profitability of the company for the year in atmi used net cash for operations of primarily to fund a significant increase in accounts receivable because of end of the year product shipments in in net cash was used in operations primarily funding atmi operating losses the amount of the companys working capital has not changed significantly since the closing of the public offering working capital was at december compared to at december the companys investing activities include capital expenditures in and of and respectively the capital expenditures were primarily focused on manufacturing expansion for ecosys and novamos and laboratory construction for customer application work for ecosys the and capital was spent on renovations and leasehold improvements for the danbury and san jose facilities upgrades to the companys information systems and purchase of laboratory equipment among other investing activities for atmi sold in marketable securities and made a million payment in connection with the acquisition of guardian during atmi made a million investment in candescent technologies corporation formerly silicon video corporation and purchased of marketable securities with the proceeds received from the public offering when the company restructured novapure and sold a portion of its assets in atmi received net proceeds of approximately million through the end of atmi had used million from capital leases in financing capital equipment purchases financial institutions have provided collateral based loans for million the state of connecticut has contributed loans of almost million about million was been extended to atmi by parties to the companys acquisition activities at year end nearly million of loans and financing remained outstanding notes payable extend through june with interest rates from to atmi made payments of on notes payable this year last year notes paid were while in payments totaled in december atmi was extended a million unsecured line of credit by its commercial bank to assist in financing future activities atmi believes the cash generated from operations and the proceeds from last years common stock offering together with existing sources of liquidity will satisfy projected working capital and cash requirements at least through the end of however atmi believes the level of financial resources available to it is an important competitive factor in its industry and may seek additional capital prior to the end of that period the company considers raising additional capital on an on going basis as market factors and its needs suggest additionally atmi considers on a continuing basis potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses complementary to its current business which may require additional cash inflation during the last three years inflation has not had a significant impact on atmis operating results safe
