item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe we are a leading technology company that develops innovative and efficacious products for regenerative medicine we are focused on creating innovative technology platforms that will provide us with a variety of procedural specific biologic products to address the changing needs of orthopedics and healthcare in general by developing specific products for specific procedures we believe we will be able to provide the surgeon with the right product at the right time for the right procedure and therefore improve patient outcomes we are currently focused on three technologies magnifuse plexur and hct each of these technologies have generated and we expect will continue to generate a variety of procedural specific products allowing us to pursue opportunities in existing and new markets our legacy business lines lead by our proprietary grafton technology have provided us with a base of business these legacy business lines allow us to cover overhead and manufacturing capacity as we drive the launch of new products from the magnifuse plexur and hct technologies we believe the magnifuse plexur and hct technology platforms will drive our future growth table of contents our goal is to utilize our technology platforms to develop tissue forms and products collectively referred to herein as products to create procedure specific solutions to repair replace or heal bone and tissue loss caused by trauma disease or surgical intervention and to augment prosthetic implant procedures to facilitate spinal fusion and to replace and or repair damaged ligaments tendons and other tissues within the human body we provide our biologic solutions to orthopedic spinal trauma neurosurgical and oralmaxillofacial surgeons for use in various surgical procedures during we accomplished the following milestones furthering our efforts to transform the company to a biologics solutions business early in the fourth quarter we announced the first us spinal surgery using magnifusetm pc posterior cervical which officially marked the start of the controlled release for a family of products based upon the magnifusetm technology platform magnifusetm pc was utilized during a posterior cervical fusion surgery and was cited as being easy to use and intuitive with a differentiated self contained delivery system in the fourth quarter we signed a multi year tissue supply agreement with community tissue services cts with an initial term spanning years the agreement replaced a previous contract between the two companies that would have expired in under the terms of the agreement cts will supply us with whole donors and cortical shafts based upon periodic forecast requirements and available tissue supply during the fourth quarter we announced plexur m was had been utilized in surgeries focused on orthopedic trauma joint replacements and oncology related procedures late in the fourth quarter we submitted a k application to the fda to obtain marketing clearance for the use of our duratech bioregeneration matrix to repair or replace the dura mater in various cranial surgical procedures we expect to receive preliminary feedback from the fda regarding the pending application late in the first quarter of in december we entered into a million secured credit facility with a bank that will serve to augment our million cash position at december should it be required table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for and year ended december in thousands amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing selling and ga rd total operating expenses operating income loss other expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted net income loss net loss for the year ended december was million or diluted loss per share the net loss included gross profit of million related to patent license fees compared to results of operations declined primarily as a result of the decline in revenue and a related decline in units processed which negatively impacted gross margins due to our inability to efficiently absorb fixed costs net income for the year ended december was million or diluted earnings per share and resulted from improved gross margins which were partially offset by higher operating expenses as compared to net income in also included a gain of million from a litigation settlement and million in license fee income while included a charge of million related to the settlement of certain litigation table of contents revenue for the year ended december revenue declined to million compared to revenue of million for the prior year due mainly to our exiting the business of processing tissue for others we plan to focus our strategic efforts on the introduction of the new products from our technology platforms and the expansion of such products in the market and maintaining our market position of our existing product lines the following table details the components of our revenue for the years indicated percent change year ended december vs vs in thousands dbm segment hybridsynthetic segment traditional tissue segment spinal allograft segment client services segment other compared to dbm segment revenue which consists of revenue from the sale of grafton dbmxpanse bone inserts and revenue from the processing of private label dbm declined in as compared to primarily as a result of the anticipated loss in revenue from the temporary suspension of distributing tissue recovered by our bulgarian subsidiary and a decline in domestic unit sales volume revenue from grafton dbmxpanse bone inserts and revenue from private label dbm decreased and respectively in compared to the prior year revenue in the hybridsynthetic segment which consists of revenue from our plexur biocomposites magnifuse technology and graftcage spacers increased in as compared to as a result of the introduction of plexur m and the various magnifuse tissue products traditional tissue segment revenue generated from the worldwide distribution of allograft bone tissue grafts increased in as compared to primarily due to increased domestic unit sales volume offsetting a decline in international revenue revenue in the spinal allograft segment decreased primarily due to a decrease in domestic unit sales volume we anticipate continued competitive challenges for our spinal allografts in client services segment revenue which is generated by the processing of allograft bone tissue for our clients declined as expected in as compared to the revenue generated in relates mainly to the winding down of our relationship with the musculoskeletal transplant foundation mtf revenue in this segment in future years will be insignificant other revenue consisted mainly of million of patent license fees in compared to million in and revenue from the international distribution of xenograft products and miscellaneous other revenue for the year ended december domestic revenue was million compared to million in or and of total revenue respectively excluding license fee revenue in domestic revenue declined from the prior year the reduction in domestic revenue for mainly results from reductions in dbm revenue and client service revenue as a result of the winding down of the mtf relationship for the year ended december international revenue was million compared to million in or and of total revenue respectively the reduction in international revenue for mainly results from a decline in revenue from the greek market as a result of economic and government reimbursement conditions in greece and a loss of revenue in a key asian market we expect the greek and asian markets to recover slowly and therefore do not expect meaningful revenue contribution from these markets in table of contents compared to dbm segment revenue declined in as compared to primarily as a result of the decline in private label revenue revenue from grafton dbmxpanse bone inserts and revenue from private label dbm changed and respectively in compared to revenue from grafton dbm was negatively impacted in as a result of a decline in average selling prices the decline in private label revenue was primarily due to one of our private label dbm customers formally notifying us of their decision not to renew their current agreement with us upon the agreements expiration in march we recognized million of revenue from this customer in the first quarter of and the customer did not make any purchases thereafter revenue in the hybridsynthetic segment increased for the year ended december compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a increase in plexur p revenue due to increased unit volume revenue in our traditional tissue segment increased in as compared to the increase in traditional tissue revenue resulted from increased unit sales volume revenue in the spinal allograft segment declined in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in unit sales volume client services segment revenue which is generated by the processing of allograft bone tissue for our clients mainly mtf increased in as compared to other revenue consisted mainly of million related to license fees the international distribution of xenograft products and revenue from the distribution of the kinesis bmac system major customers in no customers accounted for more than of revenue in and mtf accounted for and respectively of consolidated revenue our agreements with mtf expired on december gross margin year ended december in thousands gross profit gross margin in gross margin declined from the prior year level primarily due to higher per unit costs due to our inability to efficiently absorb the fixed cost base of our processing facility as a result of the lower unit sales volume our patent licensing arrangements contributed million and million to gross profits in and respectively in gross margin increased over the gross margin level in the prior year primarily due to increased unit processing volumes processing efficiencies and better management of inventory risk exposures such as obsolescence table of contents operating expenses percent change year ended december vs vs in thousands marketing selling and general and administrative research development total marketing selling and general and administrative expenses declined in compared to the prior year in marketing selling and general and administrative declined primarily due to lower consulting and professional fees in research and development expenses decreased as compared to primarily due to several new tissue technologies and products moving from development to commercialization marketing selling and general and administrative expenses in were relatively flat compared to in we had higher non cash compensation costs for equity awards and increased marketing and selling expenses compared to the prior year offset by lower cash based performance compensation expense compensation expense related to our equity award program was million in compared to million in also in we incurred million in costs associated with the settlement of and legal fees incurred in connection with certain litigation for research and development expenses increased as compared to primarily due to the costs incurred for

selling expenses for were relatively flat compared to as a result in product segment operating income as a percent of revenue declined to compared to in the prior year costs and expenses associated with corporate for the year ended december declined when compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower professional fees and lower performance compensation expense partially offset by severance costs incurred in late total product segment operating income of million for the year ended december declined compared to segment operating income was negatively impacted by higher selling

compared to in the prior year table of contents costs and expenses associated with corporate segment declined for compared to in higher research and development expenses were offset by lower performance compensation expenses while in we also incurred a litigation settlement of million other income expense for the year ended december other expense of million is primarily related to interest expense associated with our capital lease obligation for the year ended december interest income miscellaneous income and expenses and foreign exchange gains and losses were not significant for the year ended december other expenses of million primarily represents million in interest expense associated with our capital lease obligation offset partially by interest income of million and litigation settlement income of million for the year ended december aggregate foreign exchange gains and losses were not significant for the year ended december other expenses of million represents million of interest expense associated with our capital lease obligation partially offset by interest income on invested cash balances of million future foreign exchange gains and losses including those related to intercompany debt may have a material impact on our results of operations in the event of significant changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro although the impact of such gains and losses should not have any impact on consolidated cash flows income tax provision in as a result of incurring a loss for federal tax purposes we did not provide for federal income taxes but did provide a provision for certain state taxes on alternative methods and for foreign taxes in addition as a result of settlement of various uncertain tax positions during the company recorded an income tax benefit for federal state and foreign taxes of in and after the application of available net operating loss carryforwards we provided for federal income taxes based on the alternative minimum tax method as well as provided a provision for certain state taxes on alternative methods and foreign taxes in we also recorded a charge related to our assessment of uncertain tax positions mainly as a result of an ongoing federal tax audit the carryforwards utilized for federal state and foreign purposes carried full valuation allowances our state income tax benefit in was primarily due to the reversal of certain domestic state tax reserves and the filing for a state tax refund related to a prior year partially offset by a provision for minimum state taxes in certain jurisdictions at december and the company evaluated the continuing need for valuation allowances for its domestic and foreign deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board codification topic codification asc income taxes which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable the company has determined based on its assessment that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of such valuation allowances the company intends to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances the company evaluates its position with respect to the valuation allowance each quarter by taking into consideration numerous factors including but not limited to past present and forecasted results the impact in each jurisdiction of operation activities and the anticipated effects of the companys strategic plan we file us state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal foreign and most state authorities including but not limited to the united states france bulgaria and the state of new jersey during the us internal revenue service irs examination of our through federal tax returns the state of new jerseys examination of our through state income tax filings and the french tax authoritys audit of the and tax filings by our french subsidiary were concluded the audits resulted in the payment of a minor amount of taxes as a result of the french tax audit the aggregate amount of our available federal and state of new jersey net operating loss carryforwards nols was not materially impacted certain federal research and development credit carryforwards were eliminated table of contents the components of our unrecognized tax benefits utbs are substantially comprised of deferred tax assets which are subject to a full valuation allowance if we prevail in matters for which either a receivable or a liability for a utb has been established we are required to pay an amount or utilize nols to settle a tax liability or estimates regarding a utb change as a result in changes in facts and circumstances our effective tax rate in a given financial reporting period may be affected a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of utbs is as follows in thousands unrecognized tax benefits january excluding interest and penalties additions related to current period tax positions additions related to prior period tax positions reductions related to prior periods tax positions reductions related to settlements with taxing authorities reductions related to expiration of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits december accrued interest and penalties january additionsreductions charged to expense reductions related to expiration of statute of limitations accrued interest and penalties december at december and the reduction in net federal state and foreign deferred tax assets as a result of utbs was offset by a similar change in the related valuation allowance it is expected that the amount of utbs will change in the next twelve months however we do not anticipate the change to be significant liquidity and capital resources december december in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital stockholders equity year ended december summary of cash flow net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities net cash used by operating activities was million in compared to million provided by operating activities in the change resulted primarily from the net loss for compared to a profit in the prior year and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million during we increased our investment in tissue inventories by million in we increased our investment in additional tissue inventories by which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the prior year and principally relates to the funding of capital expenditures and intellectual property in capital expenditures included the implementation of a new enterprise software system and expenditures for production equipment and facilities for new products we anticipate that for the funding of capital expenditures and patent development will be relatively consistent with our levels table of contents cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december and respectively principal payments on our capital lease obligation were million and million in and respectively in cash inflows of million were generated from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan repurchase of common stock in december our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to million of shares of our common stock may be acquired stock repurchases may be executed from time to time at current market prices through open market and privately negotiated transactions in such amounts as management deems appropriate the final number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the level of our cash and cash equivalents price corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions the repurchase program may be terminated at any time without prior notice during the first quarter of we repurchased shares with an average price paid of per share we made no repurchases during the balance of through december we had acquired shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of per share further liquidity and financing needs at december cash and cash equivalents were million a decline of million from cash and cash equivalents of million at december the decline in cash during was primarily attributable to the net loss payments to vendors funding capital expenditures and making required principal payments on our capital lease obligation for we have instituted plans to recover some of our investments in working capital but we will still fund additional investments in capital expenditures and make payments under the capital lease obligation we are instituting cost reduction programs to align our infrastructure and initiatives with the size of our revenue base in addition we are currently focused on the launch of several new tissue products from our new proprietary technology platforms which we believe will provide revenue growth in future periods revenue growth is the most important factor in achieving the benefits of our internal financial model by leveraging our processing operation and back office infrastructure all of these efforts are important components of our plan to reduce the cash burn rate based on our current projections and estimates we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents credit facility cash generated from operations and the favorable cash impact from the actions noted above will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs for the next twelve months we can provide no assurance our efforts will be successful to recover some of the investments we have made in working capital that our cost reduction programs will be effective that our new products will be accepted in the market or that we will realize the benefits of our internal financial model our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including the progress of our product launches and product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals if any which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development and the resources we devote to the development manufacture and marketing of our services and products should we not attain our current projections and estimates the pace of new product introductions and development can be effected we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plans we can provide no assurance that such additional funds will be available or if available that such funds will be available on favorable terms table of contents credit facility on december we entered into a revolving credit and security agreement the credit agreement with pnc bank national association as lender and agent pnc pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement and upon request we may borrow from pnc up to million subject to a maximum borrowing base that is based upon an amount equal to of our eligible receivables as that term is defined in the credit agreement less such reserves as pnc reasonably deems proper and necessary under the credit agreement we are permitted to use the proceeds of any such borrowings to satisfy our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at one of three variable rates pncs base commercial lending rate plus the federal funds open rate plus or libor plus in no event will the interest rate be less than borrowings are secured by essentially all our assets under the credit agreement we are obligated to pay pnc a quarterly facility fee of per annum on the unused portion of the credit agreement we are also required to maintain compliance with various financial and other covenants and conditions including but not limited to a prohibition on paying cash dividends a requirement that a fixed charge coverage ratio be maintained beginning on march and certain limitations on engaging in affiliate transactions making acquisitions incurring additional indebtedness and making capital expenditures the breach of any of which would permit pnc to accelerate the obligations the credit facility also includes subjective acceleration provisions such provisions are based upon in the reasonable opinion of pnc the occurrence of any adverse or material change in the condition or affairs financial or otherwise of us which impairs the interest of pnc as of december there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and we are in compliance with all covenants net loss carryforwards at december we had aggregate federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and federal research and development and alternative minimum tax credits of million and million respectively which expire in varying amounts beginning in through at december we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million state net operating loss carryforwards which primarily offset new jersey taxable income expire in varying amounts beginning in through in addition we had state research and development manufacturing and other credits of primarily to offset new jersey income taxes which expire in varying amounts beginning in through table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands less than years years more than contractual obligations total one year years capital lease obligation non cancelable operating lease obligations retirement and severance payments asset retirement obligation shrewsbury facility asset retirement obligation eatontown facility reimbursement under tissue supply agreements total represents the future value of the shrewsbury asset retirement obligation as of december this asset retirement obligation will be accreted from its current value as of december of million to its expected future value over the next four years represents the future value of the eatontown asset retirement obligation as of december this asset retirement obligation will be accreted from its current value as of december of million to its expected future value over the next sixteen years represents the minimum reimbursement to be made under our agreement with a supplier for their services of donor recovery and donor eligibility related to the allograft bone tissue to be supplied to us over the current term of the agreement off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are materially likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an on going basis we evaluate the estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available these estimates generally include those related to product returns bad debts inventories including purchase commitments deferred processing costs including reserves for rework excess and obsolescence long lived assets asset retirement obligations income taxes stock based compensation contingencies and litigation we base the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we record reductions to revenue for estimated returns based upon historical experience if future returns are less than historical experience a reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue alternatively should returns exceed historical experience additional allowances would be required which would reduce revenue historically the amount of returns has not been material we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required changes in estimates of collection risk related to accounts receivable can result in decreases or increases in current period operating costs table of contents we recognize patent license fees as other revenue when our performance under the applicable agreement is substantially complete and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize revenue for nonmonetary transactions based on the fair value of the asset received or surrendered whichever is more clearly evident we write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated excess obsolescence or unmarketable tissue grafts and products equal to the lower of cost or market value excess and obsolescence could occur from numerous factors including but not limited to the competitive nature of the market technological change expiration and changes in surgeon preference if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional write downs may be required including provisions to reduce inventory and deferred processing costs to net realizable value in each period we also assess our production activity in relationship to historical experience and normal capacity and evaluate the need to reflect processing costs as either period costs or as a component of deferred processing costs in periods where our actual process activities are less than historical experience and deemed abnormal we charge an appropriate portion of our processing costs directly to cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations in addition we provide reserves if any for the difference between our contractual purchase commitments and our projected purchasing patterns based upon maintenance of adequate inventory levels and forecasted revenues if actual revenue is less favorable than those forecasted by management additional reserves may be required alternatively if revenue is stronger than forecasted by management such reserves would be reduced we continually monitor events and circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets including property plant equipment and intangible assets may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset or discounted estimated future cash flows if fair value is not readily determinable goodwill is tested for impairment based on fair market value measurements on an annual basis as of january and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented the estimates of fair market value and future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning the actual fair market value and cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions we record an asset retirement obligation when an obligation to retire an asset is determined the asset retirement obligation is accrued at its estimated fair value with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset if appropriate we determine the amount of the asset retirement obligation based upon a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment and make adjustments to the asset retirement obligation recorded based on the passage of time or revisions to either the timing or the amount of the undiscounted cost estimate to retire the asset we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income in the event that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made we accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income tax planning strategies and assessments of the timing of taxability of the tax attributes we provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon managements assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected table of contents we measure stock based compensation cost at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award which is recognized as an expense generally on a straight line basis over the employees or consultants requisite service period with an equal amount recorded as additional paid in capital net of income tax benefit if any until such time as the fair value has been fully recognized we account for forfeitures using an estimated rate when determining the fair value of the award litigation is subject to many uncertainties and management is unable to predict the outcome of pending litigation when we are reasonably able to determine the probable minimum or ultimate liability if any which may result from any of the pending litigation we will record a provision for our best estimate of such liability and if appropriate will record a benefit for the amounts covered by insurance if the outcome or resolution of the pending litigation is for amounts greater than accrued an expense will be recorded in the period the determination is made alternatively should the outcome or resolution be for less than accrued we would reduce the expense in the period the determination is made recent accounting developments from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption effective for us beginning september the fasb codification is the source of authoritative united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants the codification superseded all the existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and subsequently the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts but rather issues accounting standards updates the adoption of the codification had no material impact on our financial statements impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations for material changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other foreign currencies primarily the euro as our foreign source revenue grows and represents a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues and profits foreign currency transaction adjustments may impact our operating results to a greater extent the majority of our sales to international stocking distributors are denominated in us dollars generally our results of operations are directly or indirectly positively impacted by a weakening of the us dollar against the euro or a weakening of the us dollar against the other local foreign currencies in countries to which we sell during the first half of the us dollar remained flat against the euro whereas during later half of the us dollar weakened against the euro resulting in a foreign exchange gain of million for the year during the us dollar fluctuated significantly versus the euro especially during the last quarter of the year at december the us dollar closed above the prior year end level however the average exchange rate for the year was effectively equal to the closing rate at december as a result of the timing of our various transactions denominated in euros in we recognized million in foreign exchange losses in we recognized foreign currency losses primarily related to the impact of exchange rates on intercompany indebtedness of million litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings for a complete discussion of these matters see item legal proceedings of part i of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements to item of part ii of this form k it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits table of contents government proceedings in december we were advised that during a november inspection of donor recovery sites in bulgaria by the french regulatory agency afssaps deficiencies were identified as a precautionary measure we temporarily suspended the distribution of allograft tissue grafts processed from tissue recovered by our subsidiary tb osteocentre bulgaria ead ocbg during the third quarter of as a result of a notice from afssaps we began the shipment of allograft tissue grafts processed from tissue recovered by ocbg suspension of shipment of these products had been self imposed by us since december as a result of deficiencies unrelated to product contamination we however need to complete additional procedures which we expect to complete in mid before we release a remaining in tissue product cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that may include statements regarding intent belief or current expectations of osteotech and our management the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement we desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions accordingly we have identified in item a of this form k important risk factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected forecasted estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports proxy statements registration statements and other written communications or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our officers and agents we do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents we do not enter into derivative transactions related to our cash or cash equivalents accordingly we are subject to changes in interest rates based on our december cash and cash equivalents a change in interest rates would impact net income by approximately million our credit agreement entered into in december is a variable rate facility and as such the interest cost should we draw against the facility is therefore variable credit risks we sell our products to hospitals in the united states and to stocking distributors internationally stocking distributors in turn sell to hospitals or other medical establishments and in many instances individual stocking distributors maintain higher individual balances with longer payment terms at december and international stocking distributors accounted for and respectively of our accounts receivable loss termination or changes in financial condition of a distributor as well as a change in medical reimbursement regimens by foreign governments where our products are sold along with changes in the us dollareuro exchange rate or changes in local currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar in international countries where our distributors operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations foreign exchange risks generally sales to international stocking distributors are denominated in us dollars however in certain instances we invoice in currencies other than us dollars and also to a lesser extent make purchases denominated in currencies other than us dollars we therefore are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuations which we do not hedge and are subject to transaction gains and losses which are recorded as a component of other income in the determination of net income additionally the assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates while related revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month in which related transactions occur translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to stockholders equity and included in other comprehensive income table
