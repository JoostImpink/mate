item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a local distribution company ldc serving approximately customers in the states of washington and oregon its service area consists primarily of relatively small cities and rural communities rather than larger urban areas the companys primary source of revenue and operating margin is the distribution of natural gas to end use residential commercial industrial and institutional customers revenues are also derived from providing gas management and other services to some of its large industrial and commercial customers the companys rates and practices are regulated by the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the oregon public utility commission opuc key elements of the companys strategy are as follows continue to efficiently and effectively operate the company to achieve business goals and maintain full compliance with the terms of the merger agreement with mdu resources group inc remain focused on the natural gas distribution business pursue appropriate regulatory treatment including initiatives to decouple the companys earnings from changing customer consumption patterns and remove other regulatory impediments to effective management of the business economic expansion of its customer base by prudently managing capital expenditures and ensuring new customers provide sufficient margins for an appropriate return on the new investment required to acquire the customers continue to focus on operational efficiencies manage cash flow to minimize the need for additional debt financing opportunities and challenges the company operates in a diverse service territory over a wide geographic area relative to the companys overall size and number of customers the economies of various parts of the service area are supported by a variety of industries and are affected by the conditions that impact those industries management believes there are continued growth opportunities in the companys service area especially in the residential and commercial segments factors contributing to these opportunities include general population growth in the service area including some areas of very rapid growth and to a lesser extent low market penetration in many of the communities served overall revenues and margins are negatively impacted by higher efficiency in new home and commercial building construction higher efficiency in gas burning equipment and customers taking additional measures to reduce energy usage the increasing cost of energy in recent years including the wholesale cost of natural gas continues to encourage such measures however the company continues to believe that energy efficiency and conservation are the most viable near term tactics for reducing customer bills and influencing wholesale natural gas prices they also form a vital strategy for stabilizing the cost of gas over the long term the traditional regulatory establishment of rate recovery tied to volumetric sales no longer seems prudent this traditional rate design creates a financial disincentive for utilities to promote conservation the company has filed a rate case in the state of washington along with a request to decouple the margin recovery from volume the company worked with the regulatory staff and other stakeholders in this case to develop an acceptable decoupling mechanism that will enable the company to promote conservation while still recovering its operating costs and earning a fair return on its invested capital similar approaches have been implemented in many states including oregon see below and are endorsed by a variety of organizations including the national association of regulatory utility commissions the results of such rate requests and other initiatives for regulatory relief are subject to significant uncertainties in april the opuc approved the companys request to implement its conservation alliance program which effectively decouples operating margin from the impacts of conservation and weather on gas usage by residential and commercial customers in its oregon service area the filing provides a mechanism where the company will adjust its earnings recovery to fully recover the commission granted level of earnings per customer this is done via a deferral mechanism for both conservation and weather in simple terms the company will book the actual earnings and a deferral for both conservation and normal weather each month the next year depending on the amount of conservation and level of weather the company will adjust its rates either downward or upward to ensure recovery at the allowed level the company agreed to lower its sharing mechanism cap by basis points in exchange for approval of the conservation alliance program the company expects to share earnings during this fiscal year due to this lowering of the cap revenues and margins from the companys residential and small commercial customers in washington are highly weather sensitive in a cold year the companys earnings are boosted by the effects of the weather and conversely in a warm year the companys earnings suffer peak requirements also drive the need to reinforce our systems ie increase capacity our operations group considers innovative approaches such as temporarily utilizing mobile gas supply rather than making large investments in long term capacity increases which may not be fully utilized management believes that prospects for continuing strong residential and commercial customer growth are excellent the pace of new home and commercial construction remains steady in communities served by the company in addition management believes that potential for growth also exists for converting homes and businesses located on or near the companys current lines to gas from other fuels as well as for expanding the system into adjacent areas customer count growth in this sector has been more than double the average of us gas utilities the company earns approximately one third of its operating margin from industrial and electric generation customers loss of major industrial customers or unfavorable conditions affecting an industry segment would have a detrimental impact on the companys earnings many external factors over which the company has no control can significantly impact the amount of gas consumed by industrial and electric generation customers and consequently the margins earned by the company such factors may include base load electricity demand refinery operations and electricity price in a market impacted significantly by hydroelectric generation additional electric generation and industrial customers may be active if there is peaking demand for electricity other external factors that impact different segments of the industrial market include weather temperature seasonality of processes energy commodity pricing price of natural gas supplies profitability of industrial segments and regional economic conditions in november our customer service call center organization voted to accept union representation the company is attempting to negotiate an agreement that will support our efforts to cost effectively provide superior customer service the results of negotiations are uncertain we carefully analyze the economics of our capital spending to support growth when justified under our tariffs we work with developers business owners and residents to share certain construction costs to assure a fair return to the company non revenue generating spending is also managed to assure that we use the most economically attractive solutions while providing for a safe and reliable system where possible we work with developers and customers to utilize shared trenches significantly reducing the cost of main extensions and service connections we also maintain the flexibility through variable overtime and the use of outside contractors to adjust our capital construction levels to each periods requirements management continuously seeks improvement opportunities in all areas our discussion above covering regulatory change labor relations operating practices our organization and our investment to maintain and expand our gas delivery system are examples concurrent with supporting the required activities to complete the proposed merger management will continue these efforts to maintain and continuously improve cascades operational performance within the terms of the

industrial therms delivered electric generation industrial operating margin electric generation industrial gas management services mark to market valuations other service revenue oregon earnings sharing estimates versus residential and commercial operating margin revenue minus gas costs and revenue taxes is primarily a function of customer growth and gas usage per customer residential and commercial margins increased by million for the year customer growth at with the net addition of over new customers contributed million to margins while higher average consumption improved margins by million with cooler weather average residential and commercial consumption increased by and respectively when measured in degree days this fiscal year was cooler than the prior year the difference between the consumption rates and the weather is attributed to weatherization efforts and consumer behavior encouraged by significant gas cost increases occurring nationwide early in the fiscal year miscellaneous services provided and revenues recognized relating to the may implementation of weather and conservation decoupling in oregon added changes relating to the treatment of oregon gas cost differentials increased the reported margin by when compared to fiscal electric generation margins from sales to electric generation plants increased by million over primarily due to two contract settlements totaling million oregon earnings sharing operating margins in reflect in accrued oregon earnings sharing reported for the fiscal year compared to last years reversal of in accrued sharing an april agreement to institute weather and conservation decoupling reduced the target rate of return for when sharing is required with our oregon customers together these adversely impacted the year to year comparison by million versus residential and commercial the net addition of approximately billed residential and commercial customers in contributed approximately of additional margin compared to fiscal this was mostly offset by reductions in gas usage per residential and commercial customer of and respectively which reduced margins by the addition of more efficient homes and businesses reduced consumption per consumer and slightly warmer weather compared to drove the lower consumption rates weather statistics indicate that fiscal was warmer than fiscal and warmer than the average of the previous five years industrial margin from natural gas deliveries to industrial customers decreased by year to year this reduction is due to a variety of reasons including contract changes reducing minimum requirements a decline in the number of customers and reduced usage by several sectors including chemical and paper manufacturing electric generation margin from natural gas deliveries to electric generation customers decreased for the year with the decline attributable to lower cost hydroelectric supplies and the increased wholesale price of natural gas looking ahead gas usage by generation customers will continue to depend on the variables of regional demand for power availability of hydro resources and the relationship between the market price of electricity and the cost of gas gas management gas management services margin was down from the company has lost sales and margin as a result of increased competition for the sale of gas supplies to large volume customers oregon earnings sharing the change in oregon earnings sharing amounts are the result of revised estimates of liability for refunds to oregon customers related to opuc requirements as of the end of the company estimated its liability to be based on a final analysis approved by the opuc and earnings were not sufficient to trigger a sharing with customers and in the estimate was reversed cost of operations versus full year cost of operations operating expense depreciation and amortization and property and miscellaneous taxes increased by compared to net of merger related costs of million full year cost of operations was million lower favorable items include million in transition costs recognized in fiscal a million reduction in employee benefits costs and another in reduced spending across a broad range of operating costs offsetting these savings was a million reduction in capitalized expenses related to management initiatives to reduce spending on capital projects bad debts expense increased due to higher revenues and customer bills depreciation increased reflecting higher depreciable assets resulting from capital spending versus the primary drivers of the increase in operating expenses are organizational changes in costs of were recognized related to the replacements of the companys chief executive and chief financial officers the expenses were primarily made up of severance compensation for the retiring executives hiring expenses and signing bonuses for the new executives in the fourth quarter of the company eliminated employee positions resulting in in severance expenses operating expenses in included the write off of in capital projects determined to no longer be viable the projects were primarily related to development of computer software applications purchased services expenses in were higher by compared to the primary driver of this increase is the costs related to the companys sarbanes oxley compliance work with increased costs of over bad debts expense increased over driving this increase are higher gas costs resulting in higher customer bills management believes the increase also stems in part from the transition of customer service and collections activities from offices to a single consolidated customer service call center employee benefits expense decreased the primary drivers of the decrease were reductions in medical and dental expenses for active employees and in retiree medical expense depreciation and amortization expense increased reflecting higher depreciable assets resulting from capital spending nonoperating expense income an reduction in net nonoperating expense income in is primarily the result of interest income recognized with the receipt of two income tax refunds income taxes the changes in the provision for income taxes from to and from to are attributable to the changes in pre tax earnings as well as an increase in the effective tax rate the company has incurred costs in connection with its pending merger certain of those costs are not deductible on the companys tax return and are permanent differences between book and tax income the resulting increase in income taxes from the non deductibility of these expenses was the changes in the provision for income taxes from to are primarily attributable to the changes in pre tax earnings liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the companys business creates short term cash requirements to finance customer accounts receivable and construction expenditures to provide working capital for these requirements the company has a bank revolving credit commitment this agreement has a variable commitment fee and a term that expires in october the company also has a uncommitted line of credit as of september there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines due to the nature of cascades business which is characterized by reliable payments from a stable customer base and our expectations that capital spending will be primarily funded from internal sources we expect to have limited need to source additional capital during fiscal year for this reason combined with the availability of short term credit and the ability to issue long term debt and additional equity management believes it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its anticipated cash needs the table below shows the companys future commitments under contractual obligations as of september amounts due by fiscal year contract category beyond total dollars in thousands long term debt interest on debt operating leases gas supply interstate pipeline transportation gas storage and peaking services other purchase obligations total operating activities cash provided by operating activities in improved million over last year in addition to improved net income the primary factor was the net reduction in deferred gas cost funded by the company contributing million this improvement was partially offset by million from the reversal of temporary differences between book and tax income related to deferred gas costs investing activities cash used by investing activities was down million compared to part of the difference was due to million of one time specific system reinforcement expenditures and million relating to the completed amr and call center centralization projects in the first three quarters of fiscal year the remainder reflects the companys new investment evaluation process implemented in the first quarter to assure that all capital spending provides an adequate return or is required for safety or regulatory compliance financing activities other than the payment of dividends the companys primary financing activity in fiscal was the million net reduction in short term debt this reduction in debt was facilitated by favorable operating cash flow and reduced capital spending environmental matters there are two claims against the company for cleanup of alleged environmental contamination related to manufactured gas plant sites previously operated by companies that were subsequently merged into the company the first claim was received in and relates to a site in oregon an investigation has shown that soil and groundwater contamination exists at the site there are parties in addition to the company that are potentially liable for cleanup of the contamination some of these other parties have shared in the costs expended to date to investigate the site and it is expected that these and potentially other parties will share in the cleanup costs several alternatives for remediation of the site have been identified with preliminary estimates for cleanup ranging from approximately to it is not known at this time what share if any of the cleanup costs will actually be borne by the company the oregon department of environmental quality deq is currently reviewing a focused feasibility study prepared for the site and is expected to select a preferred alternative from that report it is not known when the decision will be made by deq the second claim was received in and relates to a site in washington a preliminary investigation has determined that there is evidence of contamination at the site but there is also evidence that other property owners may have contributed to the contamination there is currently not enough information available to estimate the potential liability associated with this claim but the company and other parties may become involved in future investigation or remediation of the site as increased interest has been expressed concerning its potential for redevelopment in particular the company is aware that the local city government has secured federal grants for further investigation of the site at this time no formal investigation plan has been communicated to the company management believes it has adequate insurance to cover the costs of the above two claims in the event the insurance proceeds do not completely cover the costs management intends to seek recovery from its customers through increased rates there is precedent for such recovery through increased rates as both the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the oregon public utilities commission opuc have previously allowed regulated utilities to increase customer rates to cover similar costs critical accounting policies the companys financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in following gaap management exercises judgment in selection and application of accounting principles management considers critical accounting policies to be those where different assumptions regarding application could result in material differences in financial statements use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company has used estimates in measuring certain deferred charges and deferred credits related to items subject to approval of the wutc and the opuc estimates are also used in the development of discount rates and trend rates related to the measurement of retirement benefit obligations and accrual amounts allowances for doubtful accounts unbilled revenue valuation of derivative instruments and in the determination of depreciable lives of utility plant on an ongoing basis management evaluates the estimates used based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions revenue recognition the company recognizes operating revenues based on deliveries of gas and other services to customers this includes estimated revenues for gas delivered but not billed to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the accounting period regulatory accounting the companys accounting policies and practices are generally the same as used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under gaap however statement of financial accounting standards fas no accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation requires regulated companies to apply accounting treatment intended to reflect the financial impact of regulation for example in establishing the rates to be charged to the companys retail customers the wutc and the opuc may not allow the company to charge its customers for recovery of certain expenses in the same period they are incurred instead rates are expected to be established to recover costs that were incurred in a prior period in this situation following fas no requires the company to defer these costs and include them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet in the subsequent period when these costs are recovered from customers the company then amortizes these costs as expense in the income statement in an amount equivalent to the amounts recovered similarly certain revenue items or cost reductions may be deferred as regulatory liabilities which are later amortized to the income statement as customer rates are reduced in order to apply the provisions of fas no the following conditions must apply an independent regulator approves the companys customer rates the rates are designed to recover the companys costs of providing the regulated services or products there is sufficient demand for the regulated service to reasonably assure that rates can be set at a level to recover the costs the company periodically assesses whether conditions merit the continued applicability of fas no in the event the company should determine in the future that all or a portion of its regulatory assets and liabilities no longer meet the above criteria it would be required to write off the related balances of its regulatory assets and liabilities and reflect the write off in its income statement pension plans the company has a defined benefit pension plan substantially covering all union employees and salaried employees hired before september the company also provides executive officers with supplemental retirement death and disability benefits these plans are described in the footnotes to the financial statements in part ii item of this report the companys pension costs for these plans are affected by the amount of cash contributions to the plans the return on plan assets and by employee demographics including age compensation and length of service actuarial formulas are used in the determination of pension costs and are affected by actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience key actuarial assumptions include the expected return on plan assets the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs and the assumed rate of increase in employee compensation changes in these assumptions may significantly affect pension costs changes to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs changes in pension plan obligations resulting from these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of pension plan participants the companys funding policy is to contribute amounts equal to or greater than the minimum amounts required to be funded under the employee retirement income security act and not more than the maximum amounts currently deductible for income tax purposes the company contributed in and in to the pension and supplemental executive retirement plans and expects to contribute approximately in the discount rate the company selects for measuring its benefit obligation at september is based on the citigroup pension discount curve updated for yields through september in selecting an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets the company considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan in and the companys assumed rate of return on plan assets was and respectively a reduction in the assumed rate of return would result in increases in pension liability and pension costs derivatives the company accounts for derivative transactions according to the provisions of fas no accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended this standard requires that the fair value of all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the companys balance sheet the company applies fas no to periodic changes in fair market value of derivatives associated with supplies for core customers and records an offset in regulatory asset and regulatory liability accounts most of the companys contracts for purchase and sale of natural gas qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception under fas no and are not required to be recorded as derivative assets and liabilities accordingly for these contracts the company recognizes revenues and expenses on an accrual basis based on physical delivery of natural gas the company applies mark to market accounting to financial derivative contracts periodic changes in fair market value of derivatives associated with supplies for non core customers are recognized in earnings or if hedge accounting is applied in other comprehensive income new accounting standards information on new accounting standards is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item of this report item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has evaluated its risk related to financial instruments whose values are subject to market sensitivity the company has fixed rate debt obligations but does not currently have derivative financial instruments subject to interest rate risk cascade makes interest and principal payments on these obligations in the normal course of its business and may redeem these obligations prior to normal maturities if warranted by market conditions the companys natural gas purchase commodity prices are subject to fluctuations resulting from weather congestion on interstate pipelines and other unpredictable factors the companys purchased gas cost adjustment pga mechanisms assure the recovery in customer rates of prudently incurred wholesale cost of natural gas purchased for the core market the company primarily utilizes financial derivatives and to a lesser extent fixed price physical supply contracts to manage risk associated with wholesale costs of natural gas purchased for customers the fair value of these derivatives as of september is a net liability of million we monitor the liquidity of our financial derivative contracts based on the existing open interest in the contracts held we believe existing contracts to be liquid all of our financial derivative contracts settle within the next four years with the following estimated future cash payments million in million in million in and million in these amounts will change based on market prices at the time contract settlements are fixed with respect to derivative arrangements covering natural gas supplies for core customers periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in regulatory asset or regulatory liability accounts pursuant to authority granted by the wutc and opuc recognizing that settlements of these arrangements will be recovered through the pga mechanism for derivative arrangements related to supplies for non core customers which are not covered by a pga mechanism periodic changes in fair market value are recognized
