important factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the companys future operating results including without limitation general economic conditions changes in interest rates the companys ability to attract deposits and the companys ability to control costs because of these and other factors past financial performance should not be considered an indication of future performance the companys future operating results may vary significantly investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the companys common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and other factors including those discussed below risk factors the following paragraphs discuss certain factors that may affect the companys financial condition and operations and should be considered in evaluating the company interest rates the companys earnings are impacted by changing interest rates changes in interest rates impact the level of loans deposits and investments the credit profile of existing loans the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings significant fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations government regulation and monetary policy the banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation significant new laws or changes in existing laws or repeals of existing laws may cause the companys results to change materially further federal monetary policy particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system significantly affects credit conditions for the company and a material change in these conditions could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations competition the banking and financial services businesses in the companys lines of business are highly competitive the increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers the results of the company may change if circumstances affecting the nature or level of competition change credit quality a source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans the company has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance tracking loan performance and diversifying the companys credit portfolio these policies and procedures however may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the companys results off balance sheet risk webbank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit those instruments involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet for further information with respect to off balance sheet risks please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements non banking activities the company may expand its operations into new non banking activities in although the company has experience in providing bank related services this expertise may not assist in expansion into non banking activities as a result the company may be exposed to risks associated with among other things a lack of market and product knowledge or awareness of other industry related matters and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees with experience in these non banking activities winokur litigation as described in legal proceedings a panel of three retired judges the panel has ruled that andrew winokur is entitled to the termination pay out provision of his employment agreement under this provision mr winokur could potentially be entitled to receive certain compensation based on the proceeds of the sale of webbank if the company rejects an investment bank valuation of webbank while mr winokur would not be entitled to receive any compensation in the event that the sale does not exceed a predetermined amount as provided in the employment agreement the company may be forced to sell webbank if the sale price exceeds the predetermined amount in the employment contract even if the company does not want to sell webbank in addition if the sale price of webbank exceeds the predetermined amount but is less than the investment bank valuation of webbank the company may be required to sell webbank at less than its value item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and asset liability management market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates the companys market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities and other investment activities to that end management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure in connection with the companys lending and deposit activities its profitability may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates a sudden and substantial decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the companys earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed to the same extent or on the same basis the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools the primary measure of the companys exposures to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is an interest rate stress test this test measures the impact on net interest income of an immediate change in interest rates of plus or minus in increments upon review of the companys current and projected earning assets and interest bearing liabilities management believes that in the event of a hypothetical one percent increase or decrease in interest rates the resulting effect on the companys net interest income would not be material the companys primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the companys net interest income and capital while structuring the companys asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk in connection with the consolidated companys other investments the primary objective is to manage the investment portfolio to preserve principal maintain liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields the securities held in the investment portfolio are subject to limited interest rate risk the company employs established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the company places its investments with high quality issuers limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and does not use derivative financial instruments in the investment portfolio the company maintains an investment portfolio of various issuers types and maturities which consist mainly of equities and fixed rate financial instruments these securities are primarily classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity at any time sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings currently the company does not hedge these interest rate exposures after a review of its marketable securities the company believes that in the event of a hypothetical one percent increase or decrease in interest rates the resulting fluctuation in the fair market value of its marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements
