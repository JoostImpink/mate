item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we make forward looking statements in this report which represent our expectations or beliefs about future events and financial performance you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as expect believe anticipate goal plan intend estimate may will or similar words forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and assumptions including those enumerated in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k in light of these risks uncertainties and assumptions the future events discussed in this report might not occur in addition actual results could differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements accordingly you should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made we may not update these forward looking statements even though our situation may change in the future unless we are obligated under federal securities laws to update and disclose material developments related to previously disclosed information we qualify all of our forward looking statements by these cautionary statements for a more complete understanding of our business activities and financial results you should read the analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the audited financial statements included in this annual report on form k overview our business strategy our business strategy encompasses the following components to be a leading specialty steel tubular provider to energy customers we seek to be a premier supplier to the energy industry by providing our customers with a quality product at a competitive price and with industry leading customer service we establish and measure ourselves against key performance indicators in carrying out this strategy to seek rational expansion to meet our customers tubular needs we seek to broaden our ability to meet our customers needs by i selectively increasing our manufacturing and finishing capabilities and ii growing our product offerings for example in we increased our internal heat treat capacity by in order to meet the growing needs of our customers for alloy grade product table of contents to establish a culture that rapidly adapts to changing business environments the energy tubular business is highly cyclical in nature in addition our major costs such as steel raw materials can fluctuate widely due to reasons that may be largely beyond our control as such we pursue a low cost manufacturing philosophy and we seek to establish a culture that rapidly adapts to changing environments therefore we aim to enter into business relationships that can inexpensively flex volumes upward and downward for example we believe purchasing steel coils for our welded tubular operations on both a spot market and contractual basis provides us with maximum flexibility as to price and availability to grow and achieve superior returns on capital employed we measure growth in terms of sales dollars operating income and net income however our primary profitability measure is return on capital employed we are committed to providing increased shareholder value by reinvesting in both internal and external opportunities as well as returning capital directly to shareholders in achieving this goal for example we plan on investing over million in in order to lower costs and improve manufacturing reliability and efficiencies in addition in october we announced a million share repurchase program that expires december also we have a pay for performance philosophy under which a portion of our employees total compensation is at risk and tied to both individual performance and company performance as measured by return on capital employed and pre tax earnings our products and facilities we are a domestic producer of seamless and welded tubular steel products serving the energy industry we conduct our business within a single reportable business segment our tubular products commonly referred to as oil country tubular goods octg are used primarily in oil and natural gas drilling exploration and production operations we also manufacture line pipe which is used as gathering lines for the transmission of petrochemicals and hydrocarbons our products are manufactured and sold under two brands our koppel brand is our seamless tubular product manufactured at our facility located near koppel pennsylvania our newport brand is our welded tubular product manufactured at our tubular facilities located near newport kentucky the primary geographic market for our products is the southwestern western and appalachian regions of the united states as well as western regions of canada we also operate tubular finishing facilities in the southwest united states where we can provide further finishing processes to our products table of contents economic and industry wide factors that affect our business demand for our products over of our revenues are derived from the sale of octg therefore our revenue is directly dependent on the demand for octg which is highly cyclical in nature there are a number of factors that we monitor to assist us in estimating the future demand for our octg products demand for our octg products is dependent on the number and depth of oil and natural gas wells being drilled in the united states and globally the level of drilling activity is among other things dependent on the current and anticipated supply and demand for oil and natural gas oil and natural gas prices are volatile and can have a substantial effect upon drilling levels and resulting demand for our energy related products shipments by domestic producers of octg products may also be positively or negatively affected by the amount of inventory held by producers distributors and end users as well as by imports of octg products table of contents the average number of oil and gas drilling rigs operating in the united states rig count domestic shipments of octg products excluding exports octg imports and inventories for and were as follows average natural gas price per mcf average us rig count domestic octg shipments millions of tons octg imports millions of tons octg inventories millions of tons at year end inventory tons per rig at year end source baker hughes preston pipe and tube report and company estimates the following charts provide graphic illustration of certain information in the above table source baker hughes nymex source preston pipe and tube report table of contents economic conditions in the united states resulted in real gdp growth of in real gdp growth for remained strong at which provided continued support for natural gas demand and prices and resulting in the highest level of rig count activity in years in addition natural gas supply disruptions in the gulf of mexico brought about by hurricane activity during elevated the need for drilling for natural gas for rigs drilling for natural gas represented approximately of the rigs and total average rig count increased over based upon current settlement prices for natural gas futures economists forecasts of real gdp growth in as well as other factors we estimate the rig count will average in the rig count as of march was the amount of octg inventory in the marketplace also affects demand for our products us end users obtain octg from domestic and foreign tubular producers and from draw downs of inventory from the end user distributor or tubular producers while the absolute levels of octg inventories at december increased by over to million tons the amount of inventory tons per rig increased only to which we believe represents a reasonable level of inventory relative to active rigs therefore we believe that current octg inventory levels in the marketplace will not have a detrimental effect on our shipments assuming our estimate of drilling levels imports imports command a significant portion of the domestic octg market we believe import levels are affected by among other things currency exchange rates overall world wide demand for octg freight costs the trade practices of foreign governments and producers and the presence or absence of antidumping countervailing duty or other us government orders that raise the cost or impose limits on imports according to published industry reports imports of octg products in comprised an estimated of the total domestic market compared to in and in since the us government has been imposing duties on imports of various octg products from argentina italy japan korea and mexico in response to antidumping and countervailing duty cases filed by several us companies these duties are subject to sunset reviews in july under the us continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa tariffs collected on dumped imports are required to be directed to the industries harmed these payments are made to cover certain operating expenses and investment in manufacturing facilities in september the world trade organization wto ruled that such payments violate international trade rules the us trade representative appealed this ruling however the wto upheld the ruling in january tariffs under the cdsoa had a negligible impact on us in and we received million in cdsoa payments in table of contents we cannot predict the us governments future actions regarding duties and tariffs or any other future actions regarding import duties or other trade restrictions on imports of octg and line pipe products we expect to continue to experience high levels of competition from imports costs of our products as a manufacturer of tubular steel products the costs of our products include steel raw material costs direct and indirect labor energy costs and other direct and indirect manufacturing costs the primary raw material used in our seamless operations is steel scrap which in represented approximately of the cost of products sold for our seamless products at our welded facility purchased steel coil is the primary raw material which represented approximately of the cost of products sold for our welded products as a result the steel industry which is highly cyclical and volatile in nature can affect our costs both positively and negatively various factors most of which are beyond our control affect the price of steel scrap and coils these factors include supply and demand factors both domestic and global freight costs and transportation availability inventory levels of brokers and distributors the level of imports and exports and general economic conditions our quarterly average cost per net ton of purchased steel scrap used in our seamless operations for the past three years was as follows table of contents the following chart illustrates the average market price of steel coil which is used in our welded operations for the periods presented as reported by the publication american metal market such prices are illustrative of trends that we have experienced with our purchased steel coil the steel component of our cost of products sold lags steel purchase price changes by approximately four to six months a number of the above mentioned factors combined to result in significant increases in the cost of steel scrap and hot rolled coils beginning late in the fourth quarter of and continuing into strong us and international economic growth in led by china significantly increased demand for steel scrap demand by foreign countries and the fall in the value of the us dollar also resulted in historically high levels of us exports of steel scrap in addition export restrictions placed on steel scrap by certain foreign countries affected worldwide supply in these factors resulted in an increase in our average purchased steel scrap cost per ton in as compared to while steel scrap costs declined by from supply and demand fundamentals for steel scrap did not change significantly resulting in continued historically high costs for steel coils were also in high demand in as a result of strong global economic growth us supply was affected by the relatively low level of imports which occurred for several reasons including the low value of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies and the high cost of ocean freight in addition there were steel industry specific factors that contributed to increased steel coil costs such as rising costs of raw materials used by integrated steel companies these factors contributed to the imposition of surcharges and base price increases from steel suppliers in to all steel consuming industries including the octg industry our average purchased hot rolled coil costs increased by per ton over although purchased coil costs have declined significantly from the peak prices incurred in the third quarter of coil prices remained at historically high levels in due in part to the continuance of several of the above factors our average purchased coil cost for increased by per ton over our average purchased coil cost for based upon our view of the factors that impact the price of steel scrap and coils we currently believe our purchased steel scrap and coil costs per ton will approximate our purchased cost per ton table of contents in addition to significantly higher steel prices buyers of steel products including the octg industry have experienced instances of extended lead times on delivery of products and cancellation of steel purchase orders in order to ensure a portion of our expected steel coil needs for the second half of and for and we entered into supply agreements with our major supplier while our customers have purchased our products at higher prices thus compensating us for higher raw material costs there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to pay higher prices for our tubular products and that raw material supply will be consistently available to meet our customer demand a decline in demand for our products may result in lower selling prices which could result in an inability to fully recover our investment in inventory the effects of inflation did not have a material effect on our results of operations in the past three years restructuring of operations in we implemented restructuring initiatives involving certain operations of our business one initiative was to purchase hot rolled coils rather than manufacture them at our welded tubular operations as a result we discontinued the production of hot rolled coils and closed our melt shop and hot strip mill operations at our welded tubular facilities in wilder kentucky effective march in addition we exited the special bar quality business in june which was operated from our koppel pennsylvania facility consequently in the first quarter of we recorded million of restructuring charges including million from asset impairment losses related to machinery equipment and related spare parts inventories to be sold the restructuring charges included a million write down of special bar quality finished goods inventories that was included in cost of products sold see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information in the fourth quarter of we recorded million of additional restructuring charges related to the restructuring the charges included a million impairment loss on assets held for sale and million primarily related to an increase in the estimate of post closure costs for our closed landfill net of employee separation accrual reversals in the fourth quarter of we recorded million of additional restructuring charges resulting from an increase in the estimated cancellation costs of operating contracts in the first quarter of we recorded million in additional restructuring charges primarily related to the settlement of an operating contract for million in april as of december we have no assets of the restructured operations classified as assets held for sale and we consider all material aspects of the restructuring actions to be complete table of contents results of operations compared to net sales change vs amount net sales seamless products welded products revenue per ton tubular seamless products welded products tubular tons shipped seamless products welded products average rig count the increase in net sales in of over was primarily attributable to significant increases in revenue per ton for both our seamless and welded tubular products despite a slight decrease in total shipments the increase in average revenue per ton was primarily due to price increases resulting from the increase in demand for tubular products as evidenced by the increase in average rig count for the year although our seamless tubular facility was operating at full capacity for and seamless shipments in were negatively impacted by an estimated loss of tons due to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita the increase in imports of carbon grade products over the prior year negatively affected our welded product shipment levels table of contents gross profit change vs amount gross profit gross profit gross profit in improved primarily as a result of significant increases in prices partially offset by higher steel coil costs and a decline in welded tubular shipments gross profit percentage increased due to increased pricing and a greater mix of shipments of higher value added products selling general and administrative expenses change vs amount selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses in were higher by million compared to but decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the increase in expenses related primarily to general and product liability claims increases in salaries and personnel and increases in discretionary projects including costs incurred in connection with information system planning table of contents results of operations compared to net sales change vs amount net sales seamless products welded products revenue per ton tubular seamless products welded products tubular tons shipped seamless products welded products average rig count the increase in net sales in of over was primarily attributable to significant increases in revenue per ton for both our welded and seamless tubular products and a increase in shipments which included a change in product mix toward higher priced seamless products the increase in average revenue per ton was primarily due to price increases resulting from the increase in demand for tubular products as well as the pass through of increased steel costs in the form of surcharges and base price increases the increase in shipments was caused by higher consumption of octg products as a result of increased drilling activity during the year table of contents gross profit loss vs amount gross profit loss nm gross profit loss nm our gross profit for was million as compared to a gross loss for of million an increase of million our gross profit percent in was gross profit improved over as a result of significant increases in prices as well as higher production and shipment levels which benefited gross profit and gross profit percent through higher absorption of fixed costs generally we were able to achieve increased pricing during the year in advance of incurring through cost of sales the dramatic increases that we experienced throughout the year in raw material costs particularly hot rolled coil costs our overall gross profit percent began to moderate beginning in the fourth quarter of as peak purchased coil costs used in manufacturing our welded tubular products began to be recognized in cost of sales restructuring charges we recorded million of restructuring charges in related primarily to the settlement of an operating contract that was cancelled in connection with the restructuring of our operations in selling general and administrative expenses change vs amount selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses in were higher by million compared to but decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in decreases experienced in discretionary spending and product claims were more than offset by million of accruals for profit sharing and incentive plans as well as increases in professional fees pertaining to sarbanes oxley requirements in investment income interest expense other net our investment income was million in compared to million in and a loss of million in investment income increased in as a result of increases in average invested cash balances and interest rates investment income in increased as a result of an increase in average invested cash balances impairment losses on long term investments were million in table of contents our recorded interest expense in consists primarily of amortization of deferred financing costs and unused commitment and letter of credit fees during and we reduced our interest expense by paying off our revolving credit facility in and redeeming million in principal of our senior secured notes in july the pay off of the revolving credit facility in was funded from operations the senior note retirements in were funded from existing cash and investment balances and borrowings under our credit facility other net for includes million of cash receipts from favorable claim settlements with electrode suppliers relating to purchases in prior years income taxes in our provision for income taxes resulted in a combined federal and state effective tax rate of approximately this rate reflects the utilization of available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that had been fully reserved by valuation allowances at december this primarily contributed to a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million for in addition the effective rate was impacted by the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets which reverse in periods after december the reversal of these other tax valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by million in the deferred tax asset balance includes million related to state net operating losses and million related to tax credit carryforwards the state net operating losses expire between and the state tax credits are not limited by expiration dates we have recorded deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards in estimating the amount of the valuation allowance required we have considered projected taxable income related to the reversal of temporary differences based on the provisions of enacted tax law we estimate that our combined federal and state effective tax rate for will approximate in our provision for income taxes resulted in a combined federal and state effective tax rate of approximately this rate reflects the utilization of available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that had been fully reserved by valuation allowances at december we exhausted our federal income tax refund capability in and accordingly tax benefits from operating losses in were offset by valuation allowances resulting in no net federal tax benefit being recorded for the loss the million tax benefit recorded in resulted from reclassifying to income the deferred tax benefits related to our long term investments that were sold in liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of liquidity have historically included cash flow from operating activities our revolving credit facility and other sources of financing through the capital markets our business is highly cyclical in nature and therefore our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly we consider working capital items such as accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and accrued liabilities as critical components to managing our liquidity we currently use our cash on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our working capital needs table of contents we estimate that our capital spending in will be approximately million which will significantly enhance our manufacturing reliability reduce costs and improve our information and financial reporting systems the timing of completion of these capital projects is dependant upon our ability to adequately staff the projects and the ability of our suppliers to meet our timing requirements we believe we will be able to fund these capital expenditures from available cash on hand or cash flows from operations at december we had long term debt of million therefore our long term financing commitments are minimal we have a board authorized share repurchase program for up to million shares repurchases under the program are discretionary and the authorization expires december based upon our current market outlook we believe our sources of cash including amounts currently on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital working capital at december was million an increase of million from the million at december and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december was to compared to to at december increases in our cash and equivalents accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by increased income taxes payable accounted for million of the increase in working capital there were no borrowings on our credit facility at december and operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities in was million we had operating income of million which included depreciation and amortization charges of million operating cash flows supported a million net increase in our operating assets and liabilities major components of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities included a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories partially offset by increases of million and million in income taxes payable and deferred revenues respectively the increase in our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances was primarily the result of increased pricing of our products our investment in inventory increased because of higher quantities of finished products on hand to meet anticipated increases in shipment levels table of contents cash provided by operating activities in was million we had operating income of million which included depreciation and amortization charges of million operating cash flows supported a million net increase in our operating assets and liabilities major components of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities included a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories partially offset by increases of million million and million in accounts payable accrued liabilities and deferred revenue respectively the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily the result of increased pricing as well as an increase in shipment levels our investment in inventory increased because of higher quantities of our seamless products on hand to meet increased shipment levels as well as an overall increase in the steel raw material costs component of inventory particularly in our welded operations higher steel raw material costs also contributed to the increase in our accounts payable accrued liabilities increased million as a result of accruals for hourly and salaried profit sharing and incentive plans at december most of our profit sharing and incentive plans are based on annual results and therefore were not paid until the first quarter of the increase in deferred revenue resulted from significantly increased selling prices and a higher level of business activity restructuring liabilities decreased million primarily as a result of a contract settlement payment cash used by operating activities in was million this use of cash was primarily the result of an operating loss of million which included depreciation and amortization charges of million in addition changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of million in major components of these changes included a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories partially offset by increases of million and million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities respectively the increase in our accounts receivable balance was the result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to sales in the fourth quarter of the increase in inventories and accounts payable was the result of increased business levels and incremental investments made in anticipation of raw material cost increases accrued liabilities increased principally as the result of a million increase in deferred revenue resulting from the higher level of business activity we made million in interest payments in or million less than we paid in due to the payoff of our senior secured notes in operating cash flows in included cash receipts of million related to antitrust litigation against manufacturers of graphite electrodes used in the steel making process investing cash flows cash flows used in investing activities were million in while cash flows provided by investing activities were million in and million in capital expenditures were million million and million in and respectively these capital expenditures were primarily related to maintenance and improvements to our tubular manufacturing facilities we received proceeds from sales of assets held for sale of million million and million in and respectively we also received proceeds of million from the sale of long term investments in table of contents financing cash flows we had no outstanding loans under our credit facility as of december and participants in our benefit plans exercised stock options in which provided cash of million on october our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to million shares of our common stock the repurchases may be made by us from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions through december during the fourth quarter we purchased shares for million in we paid off all existing loans under our credit facility and also benefited from the exercise of stock options which generated cash of million in the second quarter of we redeemed the remaining million of our outstanding senior secured notes that were due on july the notes were redeemed at par plus accrued interest and were funded from existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility long term debt maturities for each of the next five years are less than million in july we filed a universal shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale from time to time to the public of up to million in securities including debt preferred stock common stock and warrants the shelf registration was declared effective by the sec in september we have not sold any securities pursuant to the shelf registration we believe the shelf registration affords us the financial flexibility to react to future opportunities in the market under the securities offering reform of we may continue to use this shelf registration statement through november see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our credit facility and shelf registration in and we utilized tax operating loss carryforwards to reduce the amount of taxes we would otherwise be required to pay as of december these carryforwards were utilized and as such beginning in our tax expense and payments will more closely approximate statutory rates you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our federal tax status table of contents contractual obligations and other cash requirements the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations except for the purchase obligations included below we have not included information for recurring purchases of materials used in our manufacturing operations that closely reflect our levels of production and are not long term in nature less than three months certain obligations are described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total thereafter long term debt restructuring liabilities employee benefit plans asset retirement obligations purchase obligations operating leases total we have a million revolving credit facility that expires in march as of december we had no loans outstanding under the credit facility we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million reducing the amount of funds available under the credit facility to approximately million as of december the facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our inventories accounts receivable and property plant and equipment see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we currently purchase electricity for two of our facilities pursuant to contracts that expire in amounts paid under these contracts are not included in the table because they can vary based on the level of our operations we estimate total payments in will approximate million under these contracts table of contents we are subject to various claims lawsuits and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business with respect to environmental matters workers compensation health care and product liability each of which is self insured to certain levels as well as commercial and other matters we accrue for the cost of such matters when the incurrence of such costs is probable and can be reasonably estimated in we decreased our reserves for warranty claims by million as new claims and changes in estimates of existing claims of million were offset by million of settlements see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of product warranty claims while the ultimate amount and timing of payment for loss contingencies can be difficult to determine we do not believe that such amounts and the timing of payment will result in a material adverse affect on our cash flows see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of accrued liabilities critical accounting policies and estimates our managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition product revenues are recognized as sales when revenue is earned and is realized or realizable this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident usually through the receipt of a purchase order the sales price is fixed or determinable delivery has occurred the risk of loss has been passed to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured revenues are also recognized when at the customers request the goods are set aside in storage at the companys facilities and paid for in full freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales and the cost of freight and shipping is included in cost of products sold accounts receivable allowances we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables based on a combination of factors we regularly analyze our customer accounts and when we become aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of the customers operating results or financial position we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible table of contents we also maintain a reserve for customer claims for returns of defective materials this reserve is recorded as a percentage of sales and estimated based upon historical experience the adequacy of reserve estimates is periodically reviewed by comparison to actual experience claims in any future period could differ from our estimates and impact the net sales we report inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market and regularly review the book value to determine if items are properly valued we record adjustments to the value of our inventory based on sales and production forecasts these adjustments are estimates which can vary significantly either favorably or unfavorably from actual amounts if future costs or levels of business activity differ from our expectations generally we do not experience issues with slow moving or obsolete inventory due to the nature of our products if we are not able to achieve our expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value we would have to adjust our reserves accordingly long lived asset impairment we evaluate our long lived assets used in operations consisting of property plant and equipment when indicators of impairment such as reductions in demand or significant economic factors are present when such indicators of impairment exist an evaluation is performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from the asset the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities our annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements as a result our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than reported on our tax return some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and some differences are temporary reversing over time such as depreciation expense these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expenditures which we have already taken a deduction for in our tax return but have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements table of contents inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods although realization is not assured management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized changes in existing tax laws tax rates and their related interpretations may also affect our ability to successfully manage the impacts of regulatory matters we establish reserves when necessary for tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority we review these in light of the changing facts and circumstances and adjust them when significant changes in risk warrant it our accounting represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation and geographic mix of earnings could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate employee benefits plans we record liabilities and expense for deferred compensation agreements salary continuation agreements sca and postretirement health benefit costs based on actuarial valuations all benefits paid under the agreements are unfunded and benefits are paid from operating cash flows the net present value of the benefits provided under the deferred compensation agreements were accrued over the period of the employees active employment from the time the contract was signed to the employees retirement date using a discount rate of eleven percent which approximated our incremental borrowing rate at that time inherent in the valuations for the sca and postretirement health benefits are key assumptions including assumptions about discount rates these assumptions are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions to develop our discount rate we considered the available yields on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations we used discount rates of and to determine the sca and postretirement health benefit liability as of december and respectively the decline in the discount rate used to estimate the sca and postretirement health benefit liability is a result of declining long term interest rates in the united states changes in the related sca and postretirement health benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions primarily changes in the discount rate table of contents restructuring reserves our restructuring reserves reflect many estimates including those pertaining to settlements of contractual obligations and environmental remediation obligations we reassess the reserve requirements for completing the restructuring program at the end of each reporting period actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates additional charges may be required in the future if the estimates of environmental remediation costs differ from our estimates refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information related to restructuring reserves and associated environmental reserves reserves for contingencies we have other potential exposures such as workers compensation claims environmental claims product liability and litigation establishing loss reserves or valuation allowances for these matters requires us to estimate and make judgments with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability we establish accruals for these exposures however if our exposure exceeds our estimates we could be required to record additional charges asset retirement obligations legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets are recognized as a liability in our consolidated financial statements these obligations are measured and recorded at their estimated fair value in determining asset retirement obligations we must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value fair value is developed through consideration of estimated retirement costs in todays dollars inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the asset retirement obligation was incurred changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of asset retirement obligations could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the consolidated financial statements recently issued accounting standards on december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no r share based payment which is a revision of sfas no and supersedes apb opinion no sfas no r requires all share based payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative sfas no r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after january in addition companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no we have elected the modified prospective method of adoption we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows table of contents in november the fasb issued sfas no inventory costs to amend the guidance in chapter inventory pricing of fasb accounting research bulletin no restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins which will become effective for us on january sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage the statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges additionally sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows other matters you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to commitments and contingencies the collective bargaining agreement at erlanger expires in may and covers hourly employees while we expect to negotiate a renewal of the contract failure to renew the contract could impair our ability to manufacture certain of our products and result in increased costs and or decreased sales and earnings item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments for any purpose during the periods shown including trading or speculating on changes in interest rates or commodity prices of materials purchased steel in the form of hot rolled coils and steel scrap represents the largest portion of our cost of products sold the price and availability of steel coils and scrap that we use in our manufacturing processes are highly competitive and volatile various factors most of which are beyond our control affect the supply and price of steel coils and scrap changes in steel coil and scrap costs have had a significant impact on our earnings and we expect that future changes will continue to significantly impact our earnings reference is made to overview economic and industry wide factors that affect our business costs of our products for additional comments regarding steel costs we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates and the fair value of the borrowings are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates as of december we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility table of contents we purchase natural gas and electricity for our operations and therefore have a market risk related to gas and electricity purchases in the open
