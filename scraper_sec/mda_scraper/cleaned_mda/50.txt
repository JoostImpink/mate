effect or prospective impact on our financial condition and results of operations statements in this discussion may be forward looking these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed see cautionary note at the beginning of this report and risk factors in item a for additional discussion of these factors and risks overview we are an independent exploration and production company focused on natural gas shale plays in in the eastern united states principally in the southern appalachian basin we began oil and gas operations in with the acquisition of our wholly owned subsidiary ngas production co which was formerly named daugherty petroleum inc our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ngas production and its subsidiaries and interests in managed drilling partnerships we account for our drilling partnership interests using the proportionate consolidation method with all material inter company accounts and transactions eliminated on consolidation going concern debt covenant defaults on november we reported that we were not in compliance with the leverage coverage covenant under our credit agreement as of end of the third quarter which also triggered a cross default on the convertible notes our third quarter report also disclosed our prior engagement of a financial advisor to assist us pursue strategic alternatives at that time we had million of credit facility debt and million of outstanding convertible notes we subsequently obtained limited forbearance from the covenant defaults conditioned on completing a qualifying transaction that results in the repayment of the credit facility in full and all outstanding convertible notes at a default rate by march or any extension by the credit facility lenders pending sale of the company on december we entered into a definitive agreement with magnum hunter for the acquisition of the company by magnum hunter in an all stock transaction to be implemented as an arrangement under british columbia law where we are organized at the parent company level under the terms of the arrangement agreement each common share of ngas will be transferred to magnum hunter for the right to receive of a share of magnum hunter common stock the consummation of the arrangement is subject to various conditions including approval of the arrangement by the companys shareholders receipt of canadian court approval repayment of the companys senior and convertible debt by magnum hunter and restructuring of the companys gas gathering agreements the transactions contemplated by the arrangement agreement are scheduled to close on or about march although there is no assurance that the acquisition will ultimately be consummated or that our lenders and note holders would continue to forbear on pursuing their legal remedies in that event see risk factors results of operations and revenues the following table shows the components of our revenues for and together with their percentages of total revenue in and percentage change on a year over year basis year ended december of revenue revenue change contract drilling oil and gas production gas transmission compression and processing total total revenues for reflect the impact of reduced drilling activity low gas prices and third party ownership of the appalachian gathering system which eliminated both our revenues and cost savings from these facilities following their sale during the third quarter of without access to capital to ramp up the development of our properties the decline in our revenues could be expected to accelerate on a stand alone basis table of contents contract drilling revenues are driven by the size and timing of our drilling partnership initiatives we generally receive the proceeds from private placements by sponsored partnerships as prepayments under our drilling contracts and recognize contract drilling revenues as the wells are drilled contract drilling revenues for reflect the share of outside investors in the last four wells drilled with our partnership and the wells drilled with our drilling partnership which raised million from a private placement completed at year end our fourth quarterly contract drilling revenues reflect reimbursements for the partnerships share of drilling and completion costs for several wells drilled in advance of partnership funding together with funding for its participation in the balance of its wells production revenues for reflect lower natural gas prices as well as reduced drilling activity during prior periods which contributed to a decrease in production output to mmcfe compared to mmcfe in weighted average prices for our natural gas sales in were per mcf for our appalachian production and per mcf overall compared to and per mcf respectively in approximately half of our natural gas production in was sold under fixed price physical delivery contracts and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices the contraction of gas transmission compression and processing revenues was driven by our sale of the appalachian gathering system in the third quarter of following the sale this revenue base has been limited primarily to gas utility sales monthly operating fees from managed partnerships third party fees from our interest in the rogersville processing plant which we continue to co own with seminole energy and fees for operating the appalachian gathering system see business and properties gas

production expenses represent lifting costs field operating and maintenance expenses related overhead severance and other production taxes third party transportation fees and processing costs the increase in production expenses on a period over period basis primarily reflects higher transportation costs following our sale of the appalachian gathering system during the third quarter last year our ownership of the facilities in prior periods had eliminated all transportation costs for of our appalachian production table of contents our gas transmission and compression expenses as well as capitalized costs for this part of our business have been substantially reduced from our sale of the appalachian gathering system our remaining infrastructure position consists of interests in the gas gathering facilities for our haleys mill and kay jay fields interests in our haleys mill and rogersville processing plants and a interest in the gathering system for our non operated arkoma properties

cost in and in the decrease in depreciation depletion and amortization dda charges reflects a reduction in historical depletion costs following our sale of the appalachian gathering system partially offset by additions to our oil and gas properties dda is recognized under the units of production method for oil and gas properties and on a straight line basis over the useful life of other property and equipment we recognized bad debt expenses of in as write offs or reserves against loans receivable from affiliates see related party transactions and critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts we also recognized refinancing costs of for our convertible note restructuring see liquidity and capital resources cash interest expense in was down from this resulted primarily from lower convertible debt levels following our note restructuring in january and a reduction of million in credit facility debt from our monetization of the appalachian gathering system and separate equity raises in august and may see liquidity and capital resources we recognized non cash interest expense of in for accretion of the debt discount on the convertible notes under the

the challenging economic environment which contributed to a reduction in the size of our drilling partnership compared to the prior years program with a raise of million the partnership participated in horizontal wells of which four wells were drilled during the first quarter table of contents production revenues for reflect year over year declines of in natural gas prices in oil prices and for sales of natural gas liquids the impact of weak commodity prices was partially offset by an increase of in production output to mmcfe compared to mmcfe in the prior year our volumetric growth reflects our transition to horizontal drilling throughout our operated properties in during the year approximately of our natural gas production was sold under fixed price physical delivery contracts and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices realized natural gas prices in averaged per mcf for our appalachian production and per mcf overall compared to an average overall realization of per mcf in the contraction of gas transmission compression and processing revenues was driven by our sale of the appalachian gathering system in the third

of interests in the gas gathering facilities for our haleys mill and kay jay fields interests in our haleys mill and rogersville processing plants and a interest in the gathering system for our non

method of accounting for employee stock options under this method employee stock options are valued at the grant date using the black scholes valuation model and the compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period we also recognized an accrual of for deferred compensation cost in the increase in dda charges reflects additions to our oil and gas properties from drilling initiatives partially offset by a reduction in historical depletion costs for the appalachian gathering system following its sale in the third quarter of cash interest expense in decreased year over year reflecting the reduction of debt levels under our revolving credit facility from proceeds of our infrastructure monetization and equity raise in the third quarter of non cash interest expense of reflects the application of the effective interest method for accretion of the debt discount for the embedded conversion feature of our notes which had a face amount of million prior to the restructuring of our convertible debt in january the carrying amount of the exchange notes issued in the restructuring will be reduced by the initial fair values of the equity components of the exchange transaction the resulting debt discount will be amortized to interest expense though the conversion or repayment dates of exchange notes and the expiration or exercise dates of the warrants we recognized pre tax gains totaling during primarily from our sale of the appalachian gathering system we acquired the open access portion of the system from duke energy in march for million and built out the field wide infrastructure at historical costs totaling approximately million deferred income tax expense recognized in both reporting periods represents future tax liabilities at the operating company level although we generally have no current tax liability at that level due to the utilization of deductions primarily for intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion our consolidated income tax expense is negatively impacted by the non recognition of tax benefits at the parent company level for we had an income tax benefit of from our operating loss other expenses in totaled net of minor income items the recorded expenses include payments and accruals totaling for various guaranteed obligations of a virginia steam company in which we previously held a interest we have also accrued for the unreimbursed part of a personal injury litigation settlement reached in march which we will seek to recoup under our umbrella liability insurance coverage net income loss and eps we recognized a net loss of in reflecting the foregoing factors earnings loss per share eps was on weighted average common shares outstanding compared to net income of realized in with eps of on fully diluted shares liquidity and capital resources liquidity net cash of was provided by operating activities in during the year we used net cash of in investing activities which included approximately million of capital expenditures for developing our oil and gas properties net cash of provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds of approximately million from a second quarter equity raise part of which was applied to debt reduction under our credit facility and proceeds of an installment loan that was used to fund part of our office building acquisition see related party transactions as a result of these activities and related cash management our net cash increased from at december to at december during we generated net cash of from operating activities and from investing activities which included our proceeds from the appalachian gathering system sale all of which were applied to debt reduction under our revolving credit facility our investing activities also included capital expenditures aggregating of which was recorded as net additions to oil and gas properties as a result of these activities net cash increased to at december from at the prior year end we had a working capital deficit of at december primarily reflecting our obligations as of year end under our credit agreement and convertible notes which will be repayable on march or any extension of the forbearance agreements we obtained following the our announcement of a third quarter covenant default under the credit agreement our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december have been prepared on a going concern basis based on the factors described below our ability to continue as a going concern would be subject to substantial doubt if we were unable to consummate our pending sale transaction table of contents capital resources our business involves significant capital requirements historically we have relied on a combination of cash flows from operations bank borrowings and sales of our common stock warrants and convertible debt to fund our reserve and infrastructure development and acquisition activities we have also relied to varying degrees on participation by outside investors in sponsored drilling partnerships during the last two years we have addressed the challenging market conditions in our industry by reducing capital expenditures and returning to our successful partnership model for sharing development costs and returns on operated properties we also completed initiatives to deleverage and rationalize our capital structure by monetizing gas gathering assets and restructuring our convertible debt during the third quarter of we sold miles of our appalachian gas gathering facilities to seminole energy for million of which million is payable in monthly installments through december under a secured promissory note seminole note with interest at per annum cash proceeds of million from the asset sale and approximately million from a contemporaneous equity raise were applied to debt reduction under our revolving credit facility we assigned the seminole note as part of the collateral package under our revolving credit facility and agreed to apply note installments payments to debt reduction under the facility our drilling partnerships raised million in and million in for participation in a total of horizontal wells on our operated properties we contributed proportionately for a interest before payout in each of these annual programs while our partnership model and several joint venture arrangements with industry partners enabled us to meet our annual drilling commitments with million of capital expenditures in this reflected a reduction from our drilling budget as a result of further reductions in drilling activity during our leatherwood farmout was terminated in year end on a block of undeveloped acres for failure to satisfy part of the well drilling commitment for the year on january we issued million principal amount of amortizing convertible notes due may together with a combination of common stock warrants and cash payments of approximately million in exchange for entire million outstanding principal amount of our notes which were maturing before year end the exchanged convertible notes bear interest at per annum payable quarterly in cash and are convertible at per common share subject to certain volume limitations and adjustments for certain corporate events we are required to make equal monthly principal amortization payments on the convertible notes during the last months of their term subject to certain conditions and true up adjustments we may elect to pay all or part of any principal installment in our common shares valued at the lesser of per share or of the day volume weighted average price of the common stock prior to the installment date we elected to pay all of the monthly amortization installments though november in common shares upon an event of default the convertible notes are redeemable at the option of the holders in cash at a default rate equal to of the sum of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest at a default rate and late fees alternatively under the terms of the convertible notes each holder also has the right to rescind a redemption call on any portion of its notes and instead require the conversion price for the rescission amount to be reset to the lowest closing bid price of our common stock from the date of the holders redemption notice to the date of the rescission notice our credit facility is maintained by ngas production under an amended and restated credit agreement with keybank national association as agent and primary lender the credit agreement provides for revolving term loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to million subject to borrowing base thresholds determined semi annually by the lenders with a scheduled maturity in september outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest at rates ranging up to above that rate depending on the amount of borrowing base utilization the facility is guaranteed by ngas and is secured by liens on our oil and gas properties the credit agreement was amended in january in connection with the restructuring of our notes described below the amendment permitted us to complete the note restructuring subject to restrictions on upstream dividends for any principal amortization payments on the new amortizing convertible notes and to monthly borrowing base reductions of million until the next redetermination the borrowing base was redetermined at million as of june and was fully utilized through the end of the third quarter our financial covenants under the credit facility are measured as the end of each quarter and our leverage coverage ratio limits ngas productions funded indebtedness to not more than times its consolidated earnings for the trailing twelve month period before net interest expense income tax expense and depreciation depletion and amortization we were not in compliance with the covenant as of september table of contents on november we filed our third quarter report on form q disclosing our failure to comply with the leverage coverage ratio our ongoing forbearance negotiations with the lenders and our inability to repay our credit facility or redeem our convertible notes under their cross default provisions in the absence of a waiver or forbearance we also reported the our prior engagement of a financial advisor to assist us pursue strategic alternatives that would enable us to retire or replace the credit facility qualifying transaction and could include the sale of assets merger or other type of strategic transaction on november we entered into a limited waiver and amendment to the credit agreement credit agreement amendment as of that date we had million drawn under the facility the credit agreement amendment provided for the termination of all lending commitments the reduction of credit facility debt by monthly installments of under the seminole note an increase in the interest rate and a reduction in the term of the facility from the scheduled maturity in september to march repayment date subject to specified conditions the credit agreement amendment provides for the lenders forbearance from exercising default remedies based on the companys noncompliance with the leverage coverage covenant and the related cross default on the convertible notes from the date of the credit agreement amendment until the repayment date the forbearance conditions included the companys entry into a definitive agreement for a qualifying transaction by december which was subsequently extended to december and the payment of all obligations under the credit agreement by the march st payment date as of december the credit facility had an outstanding balance of million following our announcement of the covenant default under our credit agreement we received a redemption notice based on the resulting cross default from the largest holder of the convertible notes and we entered into negotiations for a waiver or forbearance from the holder we subsequently received redemption notices from the other holders as well as rescission notices for conversion of million principal amount of convertible notes at an average reset price of per share on december we entered into separate agreements note agreements with the holders of our convertible notes to facilitate our sale process by clarifying the impact of the cross default on our capital structure subject to various conditions the note agreements limit the holders conversion rights to an aggregate of million shares of our common stock net of previous conversions between the date of the note agreements and the fifth trading day prior to any shareholder vote on a qualifying transaction conversion period the holders also agreed not to convert any notes after the conversion period the note agreements are conditioned on our meeting the deadline in the credit agreement amendment for consummating a qualifying transaction including any extensions of the original deadline by the credit facility lenders to not later than april for purposes of the note agreements a qualifying transaction must provide for a purchase price at least above the reset conversion price on the date of the note agreements and must result in the complete repayment of all outstanding convertible notes at a default rate equal to of the sum of their unconverted principal amount plus default interest and late fees we had outstanding convertible notes in principal amounts of million as of december and million as of the date of this report the transactions contemplated by the arrangement agreement are scheduled to close on or about march in addition to approval of the arrangement by the companys shareholders and receipt of canadian court approval the consummation of the arrangement is conditioned on a restructuring of the seminole agreements on substantially the terms set forth in a letter of intent we entered with seminole and magnum hunter including the payment of million in cash or magnum hunter restricted stock and the cancellation of approximately million in remaining installments under the seminole note in accordance with the arrangement agreement we have requested an extension of the repayment date under the credit agreement amendment to april although we are in compliance with the forbearance conditions under the credit agreement amendment as of the date of this report there is no assurance that the payment deadline will be extended or that the arrangement will be consummated if we are unable to complete the arrangement or other qualifying transaction for repayment of our senior and convertible debt by the payment deadline or any extension granted by the lenders we could be forced into bankruptcy if the lenders or note holders choose to pursue their legal remedies if the arrangement is completed ngas will become a wholly owned subsidiary of magnum hunter table of contents financial market risk interest rate risk borrowings under our secured credit facility bear interest at fluctuating market based rates accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on current and future indebtedness under the facility foreign market risk we conduct operations solely in the united states as a result our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets except to the extent that global demand may affect domestic energy markets contractual obligations and commercial commitments general our contractual obligations include long term debt operating leases drilling commitments transportation commitments asset retirement obligations and leases for office facilities and various types of equipment the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at december and their future maturities the table does not include commitments under our gas gathering and sales agreements described below operating long term year leases debt and thereafter total excludes an allocation of for the unaccreted debt discount on the convertible notes at december gas gathering and sales commitments we have various commitments under our gas gathering and sales agreements entered with seminole energy in connection with our sale of the appalachian gathering system during the third quarter of our commitments under the seminole agreements include fixed monthly gathering fees of monthly operating fees of plus per mcf of purchased gas and capital fees in amounts intended to yield a internal rate of return for all capital expenditures on the system by seminole energy the gas gathering and compression fees reflect our firm capacity commitment for mcfd and are subject to periodic increases based on operating costs and other contractual adjustments see business and properties gas gathering and processing related party transactions general because we operate through subsidiaries and managed drilling partnerships various agreements and transactions in the normal course of business may be treated as related party transactions our policy is to structure any transactions with related parties only on terms that are no less favorable to the company than we could obtain on an arms length basis from unrelated parties significant related party transactions are summarized below and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report purchase of office building the building in lexington kentucky that houses our principal and administrative offices was acquired during by a company formed for that purpose by our executive officers and a key employee we occupy square feet under lease renewals entered in november for a five year term at monthly rents initially totaling subject to annual escalations on the same terms as our prior lease in february ngas production purchased the building for million of which million was funded from proceeds of a five year installment loan secured by a mortgage on the property as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report the terms of the transaction were negotiated on our behalf by one of our independent directors appointed for that purpose by our board the negotiations were conducted at arms length with the management company for the building and our purchase price was approximately the same as the sale price for the building in the fairness of the consideration was supported by an independent appraisal based on recent sales of comparable office buildings in our locale table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable the critical accounting policies affecting our financial reporting are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report policies involving the most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows are used in impairment tests of goodwill and other long lived assets these estimates are prepared as of year end by independent petroleum engineers and are updated internally at mid year there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures the accuracy of any reserve estimate is dependent on the quality of available data and is subject to engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of our drilling testing and production after the date of these estimates may require future revisions and actual results could differ materially from the estimates impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include property equipment and goodwill long lived assets with an indefinite life are reviewed at least annually for impairment and all long lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate to reflect losses that could result from failures by customers or other parties to make payments on our trade receivables the estimates of this allowance when maintained are based on a number of factors including historical experience aging of the trade accounts receivable specific information obtained on the financial condition of customers and specific agreements or negotiated settlements off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity provide capital resources or for any other purpose item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our major market risk exposure is the pricing of natural gas production which has been highly volatile and unpredictable during the last several years while we do not use financial hedging instruments to manage these risks we do use fixed price fixed volume physical delivery contracts that cover portions of our natural gas production at specified prices during varying periods of time up to two years from the contract date because these physical delivery contracts qualify for the normal purchase and sale exception under derivative fair value accounting standards they are not treated as financial hedging activities and are not subject to mark to market accounting the financial impact of physical delivery contracts is included in our oil and gas revenues at the time of settlement which in turn affects our average realized natural gas prices see business and properties producing activities
