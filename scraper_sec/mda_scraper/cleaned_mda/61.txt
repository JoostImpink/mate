acquisition and borrowed million in to finance the acquisition of five inpatient behavioral health care facilities from umc acquisitions of eap businesses that were later moved to discontinued operations capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes in february as part of an amendment to our revolving credit facility the interest rate margins on borrowings based on libor were increased to a range of to depending upon a certain leverage ratio this interest rate margin was at december for further information on the february amendment to our revolving credit facility see liquidity and capital resources within this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income attributable to noncontrolling interest during and we owned a controlling interest in a joint venture that owned one of our inpatient behavioral health care facilities income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the pro rata portion of each joint ventures net profit belonging to the noncontrolling partner loss on refinancing of long term debt during we incurred a loss on refinancing long term debt of million that consisted primarily of the amount above par value we paid to repurchase our senior subordinated notes due notes the write off of capitalized financing costs associated with our notes and the amount paid to exit the related interest rate swap agreements loss income from discontinued operations net of taxes the loss from discontinued operations net of income tax effect was for the year ended december compared to income from discontinued operations net of income tax effect of for the year ended december during we completed the sale of our eap business elected to close and make the oaks treatment center and cumberland hall of chattanooga available for sale and terminated one contract with a south carolina juvenile justice agency we also elected to close and make nashville rehabilitation hospital available for sale during the year ended december we elected to dispose of a leased inpatient facility and recorded a million write down to fair value of the assets held for sale for this facility additionally two contracts with a puerto rican juvenile justice agency to manage inpatient facilities were terminated in during the year ended december we elected to dispose of one inpatient facility accordingly these operations are included in discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources we currently have million available for borrowings under our million revolving credit facility additionally our cash flow from continuing operating activities was million for the year ended december and we had million of working capital at december we believe that our cash flow from operations revolving credit facility availability and working capital are sufficient to fund our known future cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures we historically spend approximately to of our revenue on routine capital expenditures and currently have plans for construction projects with expected costs of approximately million over the next year which will add approximately new beds to our inpatient facilities as part of our long term growth strategy we are actively seeking acquisitions that fit our corporate growth strategy and may acquire additional inpatient behavioral health care facilities and other operations as well as incur expenditures for the expansion of our inpatient facilities management continually assesses our capital needs and should the need arise we will seek additional financing including debt or equity to fund potential acquisitions facility expansions repayment of indebtedness or for other corporate purposes in negotiating such financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms satisfactory to us failure to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms could have a negative effect on our plans to acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities or expand our facilities working capital at december was million including cash and cash equivalents of million compared to working capital of million including cash and cash equivalents of million at december the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily a result of principal payments in excess of borrowings to reduce debt by million cash used for acquisitions of million and capital expenditures of million offset by cash provided by continuing operations of million and cash received on the sale of our eap business of million net of fees and expenses the net reduction in debt included a million reduction in our revolving credit facility such that there was no balance outstanding at december thereby increasing our borrowing availability to million from million at december working capital includes net current assets held for sale of discontinued operations totaling million and million at december and respectively at december the net current assets held for sale included assets and liabilities of table of contents our eap business that was sold in the fourth quarter of for approximately million net of fees and expenses excluding net current assets held for sale of discontinued operations working capital was million and million at december and respectively this change in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable of million and decreases in other accrued liabilities of million to purchase a hospital building previously leased and current maturities under our revolving credit facility of million offset by decreases in cash of million income tax receivable of million and deferred tax assets of million and an increase in accrued interest expense of million cash provided by continuing operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash flows from continuing operating activities was primarily the result of cash provided by improved operating results improved collections on accounts receivable and a reduction in payments for income taxes and interest income tax payments decreased to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of applying income tax overpayments for to income taxes due for interest payments decreased to million in compared to million in primarily due to decreasing interest rates on our variable rate debt and timing of interest payments during the balance of accounts receivable increased million net of acquisitions compared to an increase of million net of acquisitions during primarily as a result of improved collections on our accounts receivables the increase in the balance of accounts receivable net of acquisitions during was primarily the result of post acquisition receivables generated in from the five facilities acquired from umc in march for which no accounts receivable were purchased our consolidated days sales outstanding were and at december and respectively billings for patient accounts receivable are generally submitted to the payor within three days of the patients discharge or completion of services interim billings may be utilized for patients with extended lengths of stay we verify within a reasonable period of time that claims submitted to third party payors have been received and are being processed by such payors follow up regarding the status of each claim is made on a periodic basis until payment on the claim is received billing notices for self pay accounts receivable are distributed on a periodic basis self pay accounts receivable are turned over to collection agencies once internal collection efforts have been exhausted accounts receivable under our inpatient management contracts are billed at least monthly follow up collection efforts are made on a periodic basis until payment is received our allowance for doubtful accounts for patient receivables primarily consists of patient accounts that are greater than days past the patients discharge date our allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables due under our inpatient management contracts primarily consists of amounts that are specifically identified as potential collection issues accounts receivable are not written off until collection within a reasonable period of time is deemed unlikely cash used by continuing investing activities was million in compared to million in cash used in investing activities in primarily consisted of million paid for purchases of fixed assets million paid for acquisitions and million paid for the acquisition of the real estate of previously leased facilities cash used for routine and expansion capital expenditures was approximately million and million respectively for the year ended december we expect expansion expenditures to continue during as a result of planned capital expansion projects and the construction of new facilities which are expected to add approximately new beds to our inpatient facilities we define expansion capital expenditures as those that increase the capacity of our facilities or otherwise enhance revenue routine or maintenance capital expenditures were of our net revenue for cash provided by discontinued investing activities in primarily consisted of million in proceeds from the sale of our eap business net of fees and expenses cash used in continuing investing activities in consisted primarily of million in cash paid for acquisitions and million paid for purchases of fixed assets acquisitions in consisted primarily of five inpatient behavioral health care facilities acquired from umc cash used in discontinued investing activities in consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions of eap businesses cash used in financing activities was million in compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in cash used in financing activities for consisted primarily of million of net payments on our revolving credit facility million paid for loan and issuance costs and million principal payments on long term debt offset by million received from the issuance of million of our notes at a discount of cash provided by financing activities in primarily resulted from million borrowed under our revolving credit facility used to finance the acquisition of five inpatient behavioral health care facilities from umc and certain eap acquisitions capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes we have filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s and an acquisition shelf registration statement on form s the universal shelf registration statement permits us to sell in one or more public offerings an indeterminate amount of our common stock common stock warrants preferred stock and debt securities or any combination of such securities at prices and on terms satisfactory to us the acquisition shelf registration statement enables us to issue up to million shares of our common stock in one or more business combination transactions including acquisitions by us of other businesses assets properties or securities to date no securities have been issued pursuant to either registration statement table of contents obligations and commitments

lease obligations and other obligations of million which are included in lease and other obligations the fair value of our million in principal amount of notes was approximately million and million as of december and respectively the fair value of our million in principal amount of notes issued in may was approximately million as of december the fair value of our senior secured term loan facility was approximately million as of december the fair values of our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility were approximately million and million respectively as of december the carrying value of our other long term debt including current maturities of million and million at december and respectively approximated fair value we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our senior secured term loan facility as of december at our december borrowing level a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million impact of inflation and economic trends although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations the health care industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases some of the freestanding owned leased and managed inpatient behavioral health care facilities we operate are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market including a shortage of nurses which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in our swb expense in excess of the inflation rate although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies labor management and reasonable price increases the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing health care to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal state and local laws which have been enacted that in certain cases limit our ability to increase prices in addition as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited the behavioral health care industry is typically not directly impacted by periods of recession erosions of consumer confidence or other general economic trends as most health care services are not considered a component of discretionary spending however our inpatient facilities may be indirectly negatively impacted to the extent such economic conditions result in decreased reimbursements by federal or state governments or managed care payors discussion concerning the current economic downturn is included in part i item a under the caption risk factors we are not aware of any economic trends that would prevent us from being able to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants and to meet all required obligations and commitments in the near future critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap in preparing our financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses included in the financial statements estimates are based on historical experience and other information currently available the results of which form the basis of such estimates while we believe our estimation processes are reasonable actual results could differ from our estimates the following represent the estimates considered most critical to our operating performance and involve the most subjective and complex assumptions and assessments allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding patient receivables from third party payors is critical to our operating performance and cash flows table of contents the primary collection risk with regard to patient receivables lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which primary insurance has paid but the portion owed by the patient remains outstanding we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since the patient discharge date we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows the primary collection risk with regard to receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is attributable to contractual disputes we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for these receivables based primarily upon the specific identification of potential collection issues as with our patient receivables we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts allowances for contractual discounts the medicare and medicaid regulations are complex and various managed care contracts may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis by comparing our established billing rates with the amount we determine to be reimbursable given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms most payments are determined based on negotiated per diem rates while the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates these differences are deemed immaterial additionally updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by our management we periodically compare the contractual rates on our patient accounting systems with the medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates or the third party payor contract for accuracy we also monitor the adequacy of our contractual adjustments using financial measures such as comparing cash receipts to net patient revenue adjusted for bad debt expense as of december our patient accounts receivable balance for third party payors was million a theoretical change in the amounts due from third party payors at december could have an after tax effect of approximately million on our financial position and results of operations the following table presents the percentage by payor of our net revenue for the years ended december and and related accounts receivable at year end for the year ended december net revenue accounts receivable net revenue accounts receivable medicaid commercialhmoprivate pay medicare state agency other the following table presents the percentage by aging category of our accounts receivable at december and at december days days days days days days days total our consolidated days sales outstanding were and for the years ended december and respectively our consolidated collections as a percentage of net revenue less bad debt expense was and for the years ended december and respectively table of contents professional and general liability we are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide our operations have professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of million with an insured excess limit of million the self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks are estimated based on historical claims demographic factors industry trends severity factors and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent third party actuary this estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations we have utilized our captive insurance company to manage the self insured retention while claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often limits timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates income taxes as part of our process for preparing our consolidated financial statements our management is required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating the current tax benefit or expense of future deductible and taxable temporary differences the tax effects of future deductible and taxable temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities which are components of our balance sheet management then assesses our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on reversals of deferred tax liabilities and if necessary estimates of future taxable income a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized management must also assess the impact of our acquisitions on the realization of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance to determine if all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be offset by reversing taxable differences or future taxable income of the acquired entity to the extent the valuation allowance can be reversed due to the estimated future taxable income of an acquired entity then our valuation allowance is reduced accordingly as an adjustment to purchase price in order to apply gaap we are required to make significant judgments regarding the recognition and measurement of each tax position changes in these judgments may materially affect the estimate of our effective tax rate and our operating results share based compensation we record share based compensation expense for the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such awards we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options the black scholes model includes certain variables and assumptions that require judgment such as the expected volatility of our stock price and the expected term of our stock options additionally judgment is in the estimation of forfeitures over the vesting period of share based awards item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates with respect to our interest bearing liabilities approximately million of our long term debt outstanding at december was subject to a weighted average fixed interest rate of our variable rate debt is comprised of our senior secured term loan facility which had million outstanding at december and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our net income and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at december in the event we draw on our revolving credit facility and or interest rates change significantly we expect management would take actions intended to further mitigate our exposure to such change by targeting a portion of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates and periodically entering into interest rate swap agreements information on quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is included in part ii item of this annual report on form k under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources
