our access to credit our inability to acquire land at anticipated prices the possibility that we will incur nonrecurring costs that affect earnings in one or more reporting periods decreased demand for our homes or lennar multifamily rental properties the possibility that the tax cuts and jobs act will have more negative than positive impact on us the possibility that the benefit from our

of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events except to the extent we are legally required to disclose certain matters in sec filings or otherwiseoutlook at the end of our fiscal we believe the market has taken a natural pause as higher home prices and rapid interest rate increases have combined to create a mismatch between prices and homebuyer expectations while we saw traffic moderate and sales slow toward the end of with inventories low we believe this is a temporary adjustment as strong employment wage growth consumer confidence and general economic growth drive the consumer to the market we still believe that the housing market is primarily driven by the deficit in housing production that has persisted for over a decade as interest rates have started to ease at the end of and beginning of we have seen traffic pick up additionally if the market continues to remain soft we believe our production oriented focus should allow us to move quickly to realize reduced costs in an accelerated production pace alternatively if the market returns to normalized levels we believe we will have a superior position with more homes started and available to sell and the critically needed trade base to deliver them in spite of softer market conditions towards the back end of the year fiscal was another strong year for lennar enhanced by the successful integration of calatlantic revenues totaled billion representing a increase from this increase was largely driven by our homebuilding business which saw a increase in deliveries to homes primarily as a result of the calatlantic acquisition gross margins and operating margins excluding backlog and construction in process write up were and respectively which is an improvement in operating margins of basis points from this improvement was driven by a reduction in sga as a percentage of home sales revenue to which is an all time fiscal year low from in our new orders increased to up compared to fiscal primarily as a table of contentsresult of the calatlantic acquisition in addition we ended the year with a strong sales backlog of homes or billion up in homes and in dollar valueconsistent with our focus to revert to our core homebuilding platform we sold our rialto investment and asset management platform for million in the fourth quarter of while we continue to hold valuable investment assets of rialto we will no longer oversee nor be engaged in the active management of rialto subsequent to fiscal year end we also sold the majority of our retail title agency business and our wholly owned title insurance carrier in addition we sold our real estate brokerage business in the first quarter of in our financial services segment produced million of pre tax earnings compared to million in the increase was largely due to an increase in the segments title and mortgage operations due to the acquisition of calatlantics financial services operationsour rental apartment business has seen significant pickup in both rents and lease ups the multifamily segment generated million in operating earnings in fiscal which was down from due to a strategic shift from a merchant build to sell model to a build to hold model while we still have a pipeline of merchant build communities with over homes and a total development cost of billion our real focus is to create long term cash flow and value through the build out of our lennar multifamily venture i and iiin fiscal we are very focused on cash flow generation to reduce debt and to opportunistically repurchase shares to further enhance our cash flow generation we are continuing our pivot to a land lighter operating model with an emphasis on controlling more land through options versus a more cash intensive land acquisition and development program we ended the year with approximately of our homesites controlled via option contracts and similar arrangements our goal is to increase this to over in the next several years we expect that this shift in land strategy should increase our returns on inventory and generate additional cash flowwe are excited about our position and business strategy today we expect that our companys main driver of earnings will continue to be our homebuilding and financial services operations as we expect to deliver over homes in fiscal we benefit from the size and scale we have amassed in each of our strategic markets we have shed non core assets to generate cash and have continued to partner with technology companies that can help enhance our customers experience while reducing our overhead our reversion to core and technology investment strategies have combined to enable us to rationalize our overall business recognize significant cash flow and profits and improve our customers experience while reducing headcount by approximately associates from fiscal year end through january this strategy will continue to reduce company overhead and increase efficiency in our core operations overall we believe we are on track to achieve another year of strong profitability in fiscal table of contentsresults of

capital lennar homebuilding debt less lennar homebuilding cash and cash equivalents net lennar homebuilding debt lennar homebuilding net debt to total capital lennar homebuilding net debt to total capital is a non gaap financial measure defined as net lennar homebuilding debt lennar homebuilding debt less lennar homebuilding cash and cash equivalents divided by total capital net lennar homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity we believe the ratio of net lennar homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in our lennar homebuilding operations however because net lennar homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with gaap this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by gaap rather this non gaap financial measure should be used to supplement our gaap resultsat november lennar homebuilding debt to total capital was lower compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in stockholders equity primarily related to the issuance of shares in connection with the calatlantic acquisition and net earnings partially offset by an increase in homebuilding debt primarily related to an increase in lennar homebuilding debt due to the calatlantic acquisitionwe are continually

senior notes the guaranteed notes the guarantees are full and unconditional the principal reason our owned homebuilding table of contentssubsidiaries are guaranteeing the guaranteed notes is so holders of the guaranteed notes will have rights at least as great with regard to those subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt therefore the guarantees of the

when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least million of lennar corporations debt other than the guaranteed notes either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of lennar corporations debt the guarantor subsidiarys guarantee of the guaranteed notes will be suspended therefore if the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing lennar corporations

such time if any as they again are guaranteeing at least million of lennar corporations debt other than the guaranteed notesif our guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing revolving credit lines

term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activityoff balance sheet arrangementslennar homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entitiesat november we had equity investments in homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities of which had recourse debt had non recourse debt and had no debt compared to homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities at november at november the unconsolidated joint ventures includes unconsolidated entities in which calatlantic or a subsidiary is the participant historically we have invested in unconsolidated entities that acquired and developed land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers additionally in recent years we have invested in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry in order to better serve our customers and increase efficiencies through these entities we have primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures the use of these entities also in some instances has enabled us to acquire land which we could not otherwise obtain access or could not obtain access on as favorable terms without the participation of a strategic partner participants in these joint ventures have been land ownersdevelopers other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners joint ventures with land ownersdevelopers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise eg commercial or infill experience of our partner each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partnersalthough the strategic purposes of our joint ventures and the nature of our joint ventures partners vary the joint ventures are generally designed to acquire develop and or sell specific assets during a limited life time the joint ventures are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs we and the other joint venture participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the joint venture in many cases our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions additionally most joint ventures obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition development and construction costs of their communities the joint venture agreements usually permit but do not require the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future however capital calls relating to the repayment of joint venture debt under payment guarantees generally is requiredunder the terms of our joint venture agreements we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentage some joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets such as a specified internal rate of return lennar homebuilding equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro rata share of joint ventures earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions instead we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the joint ventures or reduce the investment in certain cost sharing unconsolidated entities this in effect defers recognition of our share of the joint ventures earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third party homebuyertable of contentsin many instances we are designated as the manager of a venture under the direction of a management committee that has shared power among the partners of the unconsolidated entity and we receive fees for such services in addition we often enter into option or purchase contracts to acquire properties from our joint ventures generally for market prices at specified dates in the future option contracts in some instances require us to make deposits using cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price these option deposits are generally negotiated on a case by case basiswe regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations joint ventures in which we have investments may be subject to a variety of financial and non financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements we monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants for those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investmentour arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants however in certain instances we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do businessas discussed above the joint ventures in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third party debt to finance their activities in some instances the debt financing is non recourse thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments in other cases we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment or maintenance guaranteesmaterial contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above the joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us or another of the joint venture participants who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees however they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them some joint ventures also enter into agreements with developers which may be us or other joint venture participants to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homesthe joint ventures often enter into option or purchase agreements with buyers which may include us or other joint venture participants to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices option deposits are recorded by the joint ventures as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture our unconsolidated joint ventures generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangementsas described above the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle during formation and development activities the entities generally require cash which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing to fund acquisition and development of properties as the properties are completed and sold cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint ventures members thus the amount of cash available for a

from guarantees and does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral or the other assets of the borrowers that are available to repay debt or to reimburse us for any payments on our guaranteesin addition in most instances in which we have guaranteed debt of a lennar homebuilding unconsolidated entity our partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payment in a repayment guarantee we and our venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateralin connection with many of the loans to lennar homebuilding unconsolidated entities we and our joint venture partners or entities related to them have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained if the construction is to be done in phases the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were usedif we are required to make a payment under any guarantee the payment would generally constitute a capital contribution or loan to the lennar homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributesas of both november and the fair values of the repayment and completion guarantees were not material we believe that as of november in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a lennar homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee the collateral is expected to be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or we and our partners would contribute additional capital into the venture in certain instances we have placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities for our joint ventures see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statementsin view of credit market conditions during the past several years it is not uncommon for lenders and or real estate developers including joint ventures in which we have interests to assert non monetary defaults such as failure to meet construction completion deadlines or declines in the market value of collateral below required amounts or technical monetary table of contentsdefaults against the real estate developers in most instances those asserted defaults are resolved by modifications of the loan terms additional equity investments or other concessions by the borrowers in addition in some instances real estate developers including joint ventures in which we have interests are forced to request temporary waivers of covenants in loan documents or modifications of loan terms which are often but not always obtained however in some instances developers including joint ventures in which we have interests are not able to meet their monetary obligations to lenders and are thus declared in default because we sometimes guarantee all or portions of the obligations to lenders of joint ventures in which we have interests when these joint ventures default on their obligations lenders may or may not have claims against us normally we do not make payments with regard to guarantees of joint venture obligations while the joint ventures are contesting assertions regarding sums due to their lenders when it is determined that a joint venture is obligated to make a payment that we have guaranteed and the joint venture will not be able to make that payment we accrue the amounts probable to be paid by us as a liability although we generally fulfill our guarantee obligations within a reasonable time after we determine that we are obligated with regard to them at any point in time it is possible that we will have some balance of unpaid

our investments was related to a basis difference venture fund ii is currently seeded with eight undeveloped multifamily assets that were previously purchased by the lennar multifamily segment totaling approximately apartments with projected project costs of approximately billion as of november the joint ventures are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs we and the other joint venture participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the joint venture except for cost over runs relating to the construction of the project in all cases we have been required to provide guarantees of completion and cost over runs to the lenders and partners these completion guarantees may require us to complete the improvements for which the financing was obtained therefore our risk is limited to our equity contribution draws on letters of credit and potential future payments under the guarantees of completion and cost over runs in certain instances payments made under the cost over run guarantees are considered capital contributionsadditionally the joint ventures obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition development and construction costs of the rental projects the joint venture agreements usually permit but do not require the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future however the joint venture debt does not have repayment or maintenance guarantees neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments in some cases we agree to provide credit support in the form of a letter of credit provided to the bankwe regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations we also monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants for those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants we evaluate table of contentsand assess possible impairment of our investment we believe all of the joint ventures were in compliance with their debt covenants at november under the terms of our joint venture agreements we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentages most joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets such as a specified internal rate of returnin many instances we are designated as the development manager and or the general contractor and or the property manager of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services in addition we generally do not plan to enter into purchase contracts to acquire rental properties from our lennar multifamily joint venturesour arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants however in certain instances we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do businessmaterial contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above the joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us or the other partners who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees however they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage themas described above the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle during formation and development activities the entities generally require cash which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing to fund acquisition development and construction of multifamily rental properties as the properties are completed and sold cash generated will be available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint ventures members thus the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint ventures activities and the stage in the joint ventures life cyclesummarized

of our business option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until we have determined

related to these site improvements these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed as of november there were approximately billion or of anticipated future costs to complete related to these site improvements we do not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds or letters of credit but if any such draws occur we do not believe they would have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flowsour lennar financial services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of billion at

issuances as well as borrowings under our credit facility and warehouse repurchase facilities we also purchase land under option agreements which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the options we try to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believe to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets careful management of the land development process and limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts although we believed our land underwriting standards were conservative we did not anticipate the severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes encountered in the prior economic downturninterest rates and changing pricesinflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction rising interest rates as well as increased material and labor costs may reduce gross margins an increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices conversely deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs therefore either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operationsnew accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive list of new accounting pronouncementscritical accounting policies and estimatesour accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this document as discussed in note the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their applicationbusiness acquisitionsin accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic business combinations asc we account for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price of the transaction to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed any amount of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we believe that the accounting estimate for business combinations is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed we develop our estimate of fair value through various valuation methods including the use of discounted expected future cash flows based on market based assessments these assessments are based on current market valuations as well as the current and anticipated future economic conditions in each of our markets given these estimates and assumptions of cash flows are based on market conditions that are inherently uncertain changes in the accuracy of the estimates and assumptions could be affectedgoodwillwe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in connection with the recent acquisition of calatlantic we record goodwill associated with acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable assets acquired in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other asc we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis we evaluate potential impairment by comparing the table of contentscarrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair values we believe that the accounting estimate for goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units we estimate fair value through various valuation methods including the use of discounted expected future cash flows of each reporting unit the expected future cash flows for each segment are significantly impacted by current market conditions if these market conditions and resulting expected future cash flows for each reporting unit decline significantly the actual results for each segment could differ from our estimate which would cause goodwill to be impaired our accounting for goodwill represents our best estimate of future eventslennar homebuilding and lennar multifamily operationslennar homebuilding revenue recognitionrevenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received the earnings process is complete title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured we believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenuelennar multifamily revenue recognitionour lennar multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development construction and property management of rental projects in joint ventures in which we have investments as a result our lennar multifamily segment earns and receives fees which are generally based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs and a percentage of gross rental collections these fees are included in lennar multifamily revenue and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured in addition our lennar multifamily segment provides general contractor services for the construction of some of its rental projects and recognizes the revenue over the period in which the services are performed under the percentage of completion method we believe that the accounting policy related to lennar multifamily revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because it represents a significant portion of our lennar multifamilys revenues and is expected to continue to grow in the future as the segment builds more rental propertiesinventoriesinventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value inventory costs include land land development and home construction costs real estate taxes deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction we review our inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period the inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community there were and active communities excluding unconsolidated entities as of november and respectively if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair valuein conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level we evaluate among other things the margins on homes that have been delivered margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community projected margins with regard to future land sales and the estimated fair value of the land itself we pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward from this review we identify communities in which to assess if the carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows although gross margin percentages for the year ended november have decreased compared to the year ended november primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments and an increase in direct construction costs revenues have increased for all of our homebuilding segments compared to the year ended november the increase is primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in all of our homebuilding segments and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of our homebuilding segments resulting primarily from the acquisition of calatlanticwe estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model the projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand product type by community homesite sizes sales pace sales prices sales incentives construction costs sales and marketing expenses the local economy competitive conditions labor costs costs of materials and other factors for that particular community every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas these trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above table of contentseach of the homebuilding markets in which we operate is unique as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics each of our homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions our projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions some of the most critical assumptions in our cash flow models are our projected absorption pace for home sales sales prices and costs to build and deliver our homes on a community by community basisin order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales and the assumed sales prices included in our cash flow model we analyze our historical absorption pace and historical sales prices in the community and in other comparable communities in the geographical area in addition we consider internal and external market studies and place greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends which generally include but are not limited to statistics and forecasts on population demographics and on sales prices in neighboring communities unemployment rates and availability and sales price of competing product in the geographical area where the community is located as well as the absorption pace realized in our most recent quarters and the sales prices included in our current backlog for such communities generally if we notice a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters we consider such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjust our historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace and sales prices in the cash flow model for a communityin order to arrive at our assumed costs to build and deliver our homes we generally assume a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with our vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure those costs assumed are used in our cash flow models for our communitiessince the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the futureusing all the available information we calculate our best estimate of projected cash flows for each community while many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change the determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams the discount rate used in determining each assets fair value depends on the communitys projected life and development stage we generally use a discount rate of approximately subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventorywe estimate the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change for example changes in market conditions and other specific developments or changes in assumptions may cause us to re evaluate our strategy regarding previously impaired inventory as well as inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market deterioration occurs and certain other assets that could result in further valuation adjustments and or additional write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs due to abandonment of those options contractswe also have access to land inventory through option contracts which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our options a majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land in determining whether to walk away from an option contract we evaluate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the property under option our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired in which case our investments are written down to fair value we review option contracts for indicators of impairment during each reporting period the most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment with appropriate consideration given to the length of time available to exercise the option such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development changes in any of these factors would cause us to re evaluate the likelihood of exercising our land optionsif we intend to walk away from an option contract we record a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and any related pre acquisition costs associated with the option contractwe believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory has been and could continue to be material to our consolidated financial statements table of contentsour evaluation of inventory impairment as discussed above includes many assumptions the critical assumptions include the timing of the home sales within a community managements projections of selling prices and costs and the discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the homesites within a community on the balance sheet date our assumptions on the timing of home sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates credit availability unemployment levels and consumer sentiment changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price costs to develop the homesites and or absorption rate in a community our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community a higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during changing market conditions actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the futureproduct warrantyalthough we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades we are primarily responsible to homebuyers to correct any deficiencies additionally in some instances we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas we believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgmentat november the reserve for warranty costs was million which included million of adjustments to pre existing warranties from changes in estimates during the current year primarily related to specific claims related to certain of our homebuilding communities and other adjustments as well as million of warranties assumed related to the calatlantic acquisition while we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs additionally there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reservelennar homebuilding and lennar multifamily investments in unconsolidated entitieswe strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties for construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers or for the construction and sale of multifamily rental properties our lennar homebuilding partners generally are unrelated homebuilders land ownersdevelopers and financial or other strategic partners additionally in recent years we have invested in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry in order to better serve our customers and increase efficiencies our lennar multifamily partners are all financial partnersmost of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary or a de facto agent and we have a significant but less than controlling interest in the entities we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as lennar homebuilding or lennar multifamily investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as lennar homebuilding or lennar multifamily equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities as described in note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for most unconsolidated entities we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions on a pro rata basis based upon ownership percentages however certain lennar homebuilding unconsolidated entities and all of our lennar multifamily unconsolidated entities provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets such as a specified internal rate of return advances to these entities are included in the investment balancemanagement looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of or have a controlling interest in an unconsolidated entity factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing experience and financial condition of the other partners voting rights involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement the accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influencewe believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest but rather share control with our partners at november the lennar homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of table of contentsbillion and total liabilities of billion at november the lennar multifamily unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of billion and total liabilities of billionwe evaluate the long lived assets in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity below its carrying amount has occurred which is other than temporary the amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investments carrying amount over its estimated fair valuethe evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities includes certain critical assumptions projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities discount rates applied to the future distributions and various other factorsour assumptions on the projected future distributions from unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions specifically distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the lennar homebuilding unconsolidated entities or operating assets by the lennar multifamily unconsolidated entities such long lived assets are also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities the unconsolidated entities generally also use a discount rate of between and in their reviews for impairment subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory if a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets our proportionate share is reflected in our lennar homebuilding or lennar multifamily equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our lennar homebuilding or lennar multifamily investment in unconsolidated entities we believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates credit availability unemployment levels and consumer sentiment changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derivedadditionally we evaluate if a decrease in the value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary this evaluation includes certain critical assumptions made by management and other factors such as age of the venture intent and ability for us to recover our investment in the entity financial condition and long term prospects of the unconsolidated entity short term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity trends in the general economic environment of the land entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity overall projected returns on investments defaults under contracts with third parties including bank debt recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners and banks if the decline in the fair value of the investment is other than temporary then these losses are included in lennar homebuilding other income net or lennar multifamily costs and expenseswe believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities a higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities because of changes in economic conditions actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the futureconsolidation of variable interest entitiesgaap requires the consolidation of vies in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest a controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vieour variable interest in vies may be in the form of equity ownership contracts to purchase assets management services and development agreements between us and a vie loans provided by us to a vie or other partner and or guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties we examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing experience and financial condition of other partners voting rights involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions representation on a vies executive committee existence of unilateral kick out rights or voting rights level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partners and contracts to purchase assets from viesgenerally all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared among all partners in particular business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners usually management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other partners generally we purchase less than a majority of the jvs assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at markettable of contentsgenerally our unconsolidated entities become vies and consolidate when the other partners lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity as a result we continue to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions the accounting policy relating to variable interest entities is a critical accounting policy because the determination of whether an entity is a vie and if so whether we are primary beneficiary may require us to exercise significant judgmentlennar financial services operationsrevenue recognitiontitle premiums on policies issued directly by us are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the title policies and escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed usually upon the close of escrow revenues from title policies issued by independent agents are recognized as revenue when notice of issuance is received from the agent which is generally when cash payment is received by us expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment interest income on loans held for sale and loans held for investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates we believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenueloan origination liabilitiessubstantially all of the loans our lennar financial services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released non recourse basis after the loans are sold we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry standard representations and warranties related to loan sales over the last several years there has been an industry wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements a number of claims of that type have been brought against us we do not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on our businessour mortgage operations have established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors we establish reserves for such possible losses based upon among other things an analysis of repurchase requests received an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans as well as previous settlements while we believe that we have adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations additional recourse expense may be incurred this allowance requires managements judgment and estimates for these reasons we believe that the accounting estimate related to the loan origination losses is a critical accounting estimaterialto mortgage finance loans held for salethe originated mortgage loans are classified as loans held for sale and are recorded at fair value we elected the fair value option for rmfs loans held for sale in accordance with asc topic financial instruments which permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis changes in fair values of the loans are reflected in rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations interest income on these loans is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and is recorded in rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in securitizations on a servicing released non recourse basis although we remain liable for certain limited industry standard representations and warranties related to loan sales we recognize revenue on the sale of loans into securitization trusts when control of the loans has been relinquished we believe this is a critical accounting policy due to the significant judgment involved in estimating the fair values of loans held for sale during the period between when the loans are originated and the time the loans are sold and because of its significance to our rialto segmentitem aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments loans held for sale loans held for investment and outstanding variable rate debt for fixed rate debt such as our senior notes changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows for variable rate debt such as our unsecured revolving credit facility and lennar financial services and rmfs warehouse repurchase facilities changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the outstanding borrowings on the debt facilities but do affect our earnings and cash flows table of contentsin our lennar financial services operations we utilize mortgage backed securities forward commitments option contracts and investor commitments to protect the value of rate locked commitments and loans held for sale from fluctuations in mortgage related interest ratesto mitigate interest risk associated with rmfs loans held for sale we use derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to risk from the time a borrower locks a loan until the time the loan is securitized we hedge our interest rate exposure through entering into interest rate swap futures we also manage a portion of our credit exposure by buying protection within the cmbx and cdx marketswe do not enter into or hold
