item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein please note that unless otherwise specifically indicated discussion of our results relate to our continuing operations this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate see disclosure regarding forward looking statements below executive summary we are the second largest non hazardous solid waste management company in the united states as measured by revenues we provide non hazardous solid waste collection transfer recycling and disposal services in states and puerto rico geographically identified as the midwestern northeastern southeastern southwestern and western regions our revenues result primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection transfer recycling and disposal services we generally provide collection services under direct agreements with our customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities commercial and municipal contract terms generally range from one to five years and commonly have renewal options our landfill operations include both company owned landfills and landfills that we operate on behalf of municipalities and others we consistently invest capital to support the ongoing operations of our landfill and collection business landfills are highly engineered sophisticated facilities similar to civil works each year we invest capital at our owned or operated active landfills to provide sufficient capacity to receive the waste volume we handle in addition we have approximately collection vehicles and approximately million containers to serve our collection customers our vehicles and containers endure rough conditions each day and must be routinely maintained and replaced during the year ended december we invested million of capital into the business see note property and equipment for detail by fixed asset category in total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million cash flows in our business are generally predictable as a result of the nature of our customer base and the essential service we provide to the communities where we operate this predictability has enabled us to consistently reinvest in the business and to service our debt obligations as a result we have incurred debt to acquire the assets we own and we have paid cash to acquire existing cash flow streams this financial model should continue to allow us over time to transfer the enterprise value of the company from debt holders to shareholders as we continue to use our cash flow from operations after capital expenditures and other investments in our business to reduce our debt balance during the first and third quarters of we sold hauling transfer recycling and landfill operations in the midwestern and southeastern regions as well as the stock in an unrelated immaterial subsidiary for net proceeds of approximately million the combined losses from the sale of these assets of million primarily relating to the write off of associated goodwill of million were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations we sold certain operations during which did not qualify as discontinued operations for net proceeds of approximately million and recognized net loss on divestitures of million including divested goodwill of million the loss was primarily attributable to divested operations in our southeastern region additionally we recognized asset impairments of million of which million related to a landfill in our midwestern region that until recently was managed by a third party according to a partnership agreement these charges were included in loss on divestitures and asset impairments in our consolidated statement of operations table of contents income from continuing operations for the year ended december increased to million or per diluted share from million or per diluted share for the year ended december the increase was primarily attributable to higher operating income inclusive of higher losses from divestitures and asset impairments and lower interest and income tax expenses our organic revenue growth was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december revenue during increased across all lines of business except for our roll off and landfill disposal lines of business operating income inclusive of higher losses from divestitures and asset impairments in increased by million over the same period in driven by improvements in revenue primarily as a result of price growth partially offset by higher selling general and administrative expenses costs of operations remained comparable to the prior year selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the impact of higher compensation as a result of improved performance in loss on divestitures and asset impairments increased by million primarily due to an asset impairment charge associated with a landfill in the midwestern region resulting from changes in anticipated long term closure and post closure costs interest expense for decreased by million compared to as a result of interest savings associated with the decrease in our outstanding debt balance as well as lower interest rates from the refinancing transactions during the year interest expense in included million of premiums paid and write off of deferred financing costs associated with our bond redemptions and other financing activities income tax expense for decreased by million compared to as a result of million of income tax benefits recognized in primarily associated with the reversal of accrued interest expense on uncertain tax matters as a result of favorable developments during the year and the absence in of million of income tax charges recognized in primarily associated with interest charges and adjustments applicable to prior years partially offset by increased tax expense in associated with higher pre tax income our pricing programs and operational effectiveness initiatives continue to drive improved profitability and improved returns on invested capital these programs contributed to our cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreasing to in compared to in in addition we continue to focus on improving our return on invested capital by evaluating the return potential of new capital expenditures and by evaluating opportunities to divest operations that do not provide an adequate return accordingly we divested of operations primarily in the midwestern and southeastern regions during we spent million on capital expenditures during we plan to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during a portion of which relates to investment in our fleet we expect this investment along with improved maintenance practices to continue to have a favorable impact on maintenance costs and route productivity maintenance and repairs for the year ended december decreased approximately from prior year as we continued to benefit from a newer fleet coupled with improved maintenance practices implemented throughout the past three years we employed a strategy of reducing our debt balance by using our cash flow from operations after capital expenditures and other investments in our business as this occurs the relative cost of debt has declined upon achieving optimal credit ratios we should have the opportunity to choose the best use of any excess cash flow further repay debt pay a dividend to the extent permitted by our debt agreements repurchase stock or reinvest in our company we may take advantage of opportunities that arise to repay debt in advance of maturities as long as the opportunities are economically advantageous we also explore and evaluate other ways to enhance shareholder value accordingly where appropriate we may pursue acquisitions divestitures joint ventures and other transactions or investments in our business that complement or enhance our strategic position services geographical footprint or assets or otherwise drive shareholder value in march we issued million of senior notes due and used the proceeds to fund a portion of our tender offer for our senior notes due we also completed the amendment to our credit facility which included re pricing the revolver and a two year table of contents maturity extension for all facilities under the credit facility the interest rate and fees for borrowings and letters of credit under the revolver were reduced by basis points in addition our fee for the unused portion of the revolver was reduced by basis points we expensed approximately million of costs related to premiums paid write off of deferred financing and other costs in connection with these transactions we expect the refinancing transactions to generate approximately million in annual interest savings in may we renewed and increased our accounts receivable securitization program from million to million additionally we increased the accounts receivable securitization program by million to million in october during the third and fourth quarters of we made prepayments of million and million respectively on the term loan these payments were made with excess cash flow from operations and proceeds from the upsizing of our securitization program and the sale of assets in september we redeemed million of our senior notes due with available cash and a temporary borrowing under the revolver we expensed million of costs related to premiums paid write off of deferred financing and other costs in connection with the redemption we expect the bond redemption to generate approximately million in annual interest savings throughout we completed four offerings of unsecured tax exempt bonds with an aggregate value of million the proceeds of which are used to finance qualifying expenditures at our landfills transfer and hauling facilities the tax exempt bonds mature between and we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow from operations after capital expenditures and other investments in our business we seek opportunities to create additional cash flow through reductions in interest cost while continuing to support our fixed asset base with appropriate capital expenditures and where appropriate pursue acquisitions divestitures joint ventures and other transactions or investments in our business that complement or enhance our strategic position services geographical footprint or assets or otherwise drive shareholder value our debt to total capitalization ratio was and at december and respectively subsequent events in january we repaid million of our senior notes at the stated maturity with available cash we also completed an offering of million variable rate unsecured tax exempt bonds maturing in proceeds from the tax exempt bonds are used to finance qualifying expenditures at our landfills transfer and hauling facilities on february we paid to the irs million for tax and interest related to our income tax return this payment does not represent a settlement with respect to the potential tax interest or penalty related to this matter nor does it prevent us from contesting the irs tax adjustment applicable to our taxable year in a federal refund action at the end of january we reduced our workforce by approximately in mid february we realigned our organizational structure and reduced the number of our geographic regions from five to four the workforce adjustment demonstrates the operating efficiencies realized from our standardized practices the regional realignment reflects the development of our management team and organizational effectiveness and will allow us to redirect resources into other areas of the business to derive additional future benefits we anticipate estimated labor savings from these actions of approximately million net of the related restructuring charge of approximately million which will be incurred in the first quarter of table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations and percentage relationship that the various items bear to revenues for the

shareholders revenues we generate revenues primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection transfer recycling and disposal services although we consider our core business to be our collection and disposal operations we also generate revenue from the sale of recycled commodities we record revenue as the services are provided with revenue deferred in instances where customers are billed in advance of the service being provided national accounts revenue included in other revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas and as such the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset by the corresponding subcontract costs the following table shows our total reported revenues by service line intercompany revenues have been eliminated revenues by service line in millions year ended december collection residential commercial roll off recycling total collection disposal landfill transfer total disposal recycling commodity other total revenues consists of revenue generated from commercial industrial and residential customers from waste collected in roll off containers that are loaded onto collection vehicles consists primarily of revenue from our national accounts business where the work has been subcontracted revenue generated from transporting waste via railway or truck and revenue from liquid waste disposal table of contents our operations are not concentrated in any one geographic region at december we operated in markets in states and puerto rico our regional teams focus on developing local markets in which we can operate a vertically integrated operation and maximize operating efficiency as a result we may choose not to operate in a market where our business objectives cannot be met effective october we modified our field organizational structure by reducing the number of our operating regions to five from nine realigning some of our districts among the regions and increasing our regional support staff to add functional expertise and oversight in areas that are aligned with our strategic value drivers the following table shows our revenues by geographic region in total and as a percentage of total revenues revenues by region in millions except percentages year ended

are amortized at a rate per ton of waste disposed amortization of landfill assets is impacted by several factors including rates of inflation landfill expansions and compaction rates the following tables provide the components of our depreciation and amortization and as a percentage of revenues in millions except percentages year ended december depreciation of fixed assets landfill and other amortization total depreciation and amortization landfill disposal capacity and operating lives we had available landfill disposal capacity of approximately billion tons as of december we classify this disposal capacity as either permitted having received the final permit from the governing authorities or probable expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable throughout the year landfill was closed and was divested leaving active landfills as of december the number of sites with probable expansion disposal capacity increased to from in the prior year as new probable expansions were added at sites and sites were reclassified from probable expansion due to successful expansions in addition to these sites we had increases in overall permitted capacity at sites where the disposal capacity was not previously classified as probable expansion see critical accounting judgments and estimates and note organization and summary of significant accounting policies for our requirements to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion table of contents the following table reflects disposal capacity activity for active landfills we owned or operated for the year ended december disposal capacity in millions of tons probable permitted expansion disposal disposal total disposal capacity capacity capacity balance as of december acquisitions divestitures and closures additions to probable expansion disposal capacity net change to permitted disposal capacity disposal capacity consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december relates primarily to increased density of waste at our landfills resulting from improved operational procedures optimization of daily cover materials and improved utilization of compaction equipment the following table reflects the estimated remaining operating lives of our landfill assets based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes at december at december number of sites percent of total number of sites

expense gross interest income interest capitalized for development projects accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs costs incurred to early extinguish debt interest expense allocated to discontinued operations total interest expense and other from continuing operations years ended december and revenues revenues increased over the prior year the revenue increase within the collection business was primarily attributable to the increases in the commercial and recycling lines of business disposal revenue increased as the increase in transfer revenue more than offset the decrease in landfill revenue recycling commodity revenue increased due to cardboard and newspaper commodity price increases other revenue increased as a result of increases associated with the subcontracted portion of our national accounts following is a summary of the change in revenues in millions reported revenues in core business organic growth increase from average base per unit price change increase from fuel recovery fees decrease from net volume change net divested revenues and adjustments increase in recycling and other reported revenues in table of contents we analyze our revenue by organic growth which excludes the effect of net divested revenues and adjustments and revenue from recycling and other we generated organic revenue growth of and during and respectively revenue increased million or from core business pricing growth during within the collection business average per unit pricing increased and respectively in the commercial roll off residential and recycling collection lines of business within the disposal line of business landfill and transfer average per unit pricing increased and respectively the fuel recovery fee program implemented in to mitigate our exposure to increases in fuel prices generated million or of the total price growth in this fee fluctuates with the price of fuel and consequently any increase in fuel prices would result in an increase in our revenue which should be more than offset by an increase in our fuel expense core business volume decreased for compared to prior year primarily due to volume decreases in the roll off and landfill lines of business within the collection business the commercial roll off residential and recycling collection lines of business experienced volume declines of and during within the disposal business landfill and transfer volume decreased and respectively the volume decreases were primarily attributable to conditions reflective of the general economy in particular the decline in the housing market and to a lesser extent customer loss from pricing increases cost of operations cost of operations in remained comparable to the prior year driven by decreases in transfer and disposal costs labor costs and risk management expenses partially offset by increases in cost of goods sold landfill operating costs and fuel expenses transfer and disposal costs decreased primarily due to volume decreases during the year the decrease in labor costs is attributable to lower volume as well as the continued benefits from our headcount reduction initiative in and our operating efficiency programs the decrease in risk management expenses was attributable to favorable adjustments associated with risk and health insurance resulting from favorable claims experience cost of goods sold increased in due to increases in commodity pricing the increase in landfill operating costs is primarily attributable to increased accretion expense landfill maintenance and higher leachate costs fuel costs increased due to higher market rates partially offset by decline in volume our fixed price purchase contracts expired as of march and unless new contracts are executed all future fuel purchases will be at market rates when economically practical we may enter into new or renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk we expect that our fuel recovery fee will offset a portion of the volatility in fuel costs arising from future market price fluctuations at december approximately of our customers participated in the fuel recovery fee program selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to primarily due to increases in salaries and professional fees the increase in salaries included the impact of annual compensation adjustments and higher incentive compensation as a result of improved performance in the increase in professional fees in was attributable to our pricing and procurement initiatives billing system conversion and organizational development activities during the year depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased in as compared to depreciation expense related to vehicles and equipment increased primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in recent years landfill amortization decreased in compared to the prior year due to reduced landfill amortization rates and disposal volume loss from divestitures and asset impairments during we recognized loss on divestitures and asset impairments of million divestitures throughout the year which did not qualify as discontinued operations generated a net loss of million of which million related to the divestiture of certain operations in the southeastern region in the third quarter of also during we completed the evaluation of the long term closure and post closure obligations at one of our landfills in the midwestern region that until recently was managed by a third party according to table of contents a partnership agreement the evaluation indicated an increase in the asset retirement obligation and a resulting impairment of the landfill asset totaling million during we recorded losses of approximately million related to divestitures and asset impairments asset sales completed as a result of our market rationalization focus generated a loss of approximately million these losses primarily related to operations in our northeastern and midwestern regions during we also recorded landfill asset impairment charges of approximately million as a result of managements decision to discontinue development and or operations of three landfill sites additionally during we recognized a million expense associated with the relocation of our operations support center interest expense and other gross interest expense decreased during as a result of debt repayments and the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates in connection with the repayment and refinancing transactions during and we incurred costs to early extinguish and refinance debt of million and million respectively relating to premiums paid write off of deferred financing and other costs income tax expense the effective tax rate for was compared to in income tax expense decreased by million or from million in to million in as a result of million of income tax benefits recognized

state income taxes discontinued operations during we sold certain operations in the midwestern and southeastern regions for net proceeds of approximately million the results of these operations including those related to prior years have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we recognized losses from discontinued operations net of tax of million primarily from the write off of goodwill in there were no divestitures in that had been presented as discontinued operations in and we recognized net income from discontinued operations of million and million respectively dividends on preferred stock dividends on preferred stock were million and million in the years ended december and respectively the decrease of million in resulted from the conversion of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock series c preferred stock on april into approximately million shares of common stock eliminating approximately million in annual dividends years ended december and revenues revenues increased over the prior year as all lines of business increased except for recycling commodity the revenue increase within the collection business was primarily driven by increases in the commercial and roll off lines of business the revenue increase within the disposal business was primarily attributable to landfill revenue increases recycling

subcontract and transportation revenues within the collection business the commercial and roll off lines of business experienced volume increases of and respectively volume for the residential line of business decreased slightly while recycling collection volume declined during within the disposal business both landfill and transfer volumes decreased by the decline in landfill volume was primarily due to reductions in special waste volumes in the current year we improved our pricing structure and return criteria for special waste jobs in an effort to improve the returns on this area of landfill volume subcontract and transportation volume increased and respectively primarily driven by the growth associated with our national accounts in cost of operations cost of operations increased in compared to the prior year driven by increases in fuel transportation and subcontractor costs partially offset by decreases in risk management and other expenses the increase in transportation and subcontractor costs primarily reflected our volume growth in our national accounts and fuel cost increases risk management costs decreased due to favorable adjustments associated with risk and health insurance resulting from favorable claims experience other expense decreased partly as a result of an million favorable adjustment to our environmental reserves in primarily due to the selection by the us environmental protection agency of a lower cost remediation plan for a superfund site at which we are a potentially responsible party fuel costs increased because of higher fuel prices and the expiration of certain fixed price purchase contracts a significant portion of these contracts expired in early our fixed price purchase contracts expired as of march and unless new contracts are executed all future fuel purchases will be at market rates for the year ended december the contracts in place reduced fuel costs by million when compared to then current market prices we expect that our fuel recovery fee will offset a portion of the volatility in fuel costs arising from future market price fluctuations at december approximately of our customers participated in the fuel recovery fee program labor costs remained constant in primarily due to our on going labor efficiency efforts maintenance and repairs costs increased only slightly compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increased level of vehicle purchases and improved maintenance practices in the prior two years these costs actually declined in the second half of compared to the same period in table of contents selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to primarily relating to salaries professional fees and other expenses the increase in salaries included the impact of higher incentive compensation resulting from improved performance in severance costs associated with an initiative to control labor costs and other unrelated separations that occurred during in addition the increase in salaries in also reflected the impact of normal inflation benefits costs and stock option expense recognized due to the adoption of sfas r as of january professional fees increased as a result of consulting fees related to initiatives to standardize sales programs invest in national accounts systems improvements and implement procurement programs during the year the increase in other expense was primarily attributable to a million reversal of litigation reserves during depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased in the year ended december as compared to depreciation expense related to vehicles and equipment increased primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in recent periods for the year ended december landfill amortization increased slightly due to increased amortization rates partially offset by volume decreases loss from divestitures and asset impairments during we recorded losses of approximately million related to divestitures and asset impairments asset sales completed as a result of our market rationalization focus generated a loss of

result of managements decision to discontinue development and or operations of three landfill sites additionally during we recognized a million expense associated with the relocation of our operations support center interest expense and other interest expense and other decreased by in as compared to gross interest expense increased slightly during the year as a result of rising interest rates on the variable portion of our debt offset by lower debt levels as a result of our continued de leveraging strategy and the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates in the first quarter of and second

quarter of there were no divestitures during that have been presented as discontinued operations discontinued operations in included million of pre tax income from operations million income net of tax dividends on preferred stock dividends on preferred stock were million and million for the years ended december and respectively the decrease of million for the year ended december resulted from the conversion of the series c preferred stock into approximately million shares of common stock on april eliminating approximately million of annual dividends this decrease was partially offset as a result of having the series d table of contents mandatory convertible preferred stock series d preferred stock issued in march outstanding for the full year liquidity and capital resources our capital structure consists of debt and equity at december the majority of our debt was incurred to acquire solid waste companies between and we incurred and assumed over billion of debt to acquire bfi in since the acquisition of bfi we have repaid debt with cash flow from operations asset sales and the issuance of equity we intend to continue to use our cash flows after capital expenditures to improve long term shareholder returns this could include continued debt payment investments in operating assets and strategic assets or other investments in our business we believe that additional debt repayment should reduce our cost of debt increase liquidity and provide more flexibility in evaluating the most appropriate use of our cash flow to improve shareholder value we may refinance or repay portions of our debt to maintain a capital structure that supports our operating plan as well as continue to seek opportunities to extend our maturities in the future with actions that are economically beneficial the potential alternatives include continued application of cash flow from operations asset sales and capital markets transactions we continue to evaluate the performance of and opportunities to divest operations that do not maximize operating efficiencies or provide an adequate return on invested capital capital markets transactions could include issuance of debt with longer maturities issuance of equity or a combination of both we generally meet operational liquidity needs with operating cash flows our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital capital expenditures for vehicles containers and landfill development capping closure post closure and environmental expenditures debt service costs cash taxes and scheduled debt maturities when we cannot meet our short term liquidity needs with operating cash flow we meet those needs with borrowings under our credit facility we have a billion commitment until under our credit facility which we believe is adequate to meet our liquidity needs based on current conditions at december we had no loans outstanding and million in letters of credit drawn on the revolver leaving approximately billion of

our working capital needs and reducing debt we are committed to efficiently investing in our capital asset base our goal is to generate returns that are above our weighted average cost of capital our capital expenditures are primarily for the construction and build out of our landfills for the vehicles and containers used by our collection operations and for heavy equipment used in both our collection and landfill operations we maintain a level of annual capital expenditures in order to control repair and maintenance costs improve productivity and improve quality of customer service we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million in we expect this investment along with improved maintenance practices to reduce the total cost of our truck fleet ownership following is a summary of capital expenditures for the years ended december in millions vehicles containers and heavy equipment landfill development other total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions includes land and improvements buildings and improvements and furniture and office equipment financing activities we continuously seek opportunities to increase our cash flow through improvements in operations and reduction of our interest cost historically we have used bank financings and capital markets transactions to meet our refinancing and liquidity requirements under our credit facility we are required to meet certain financial covenants our objective is to maintain sufficient surplus between the required covenant ratios and the actual ratios calculated according to the credit agreement we monitor the surplus carefully and will seek to take action if the surplus becomes too small we have not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt we expect to continue to seek such opportunities in the future to the extent they are available to us we cannot assure you opportunities to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt will be available to us on favorable terms or at all see also debt covenants in contractual obligations and commitments significant financing events in in march we issued million of senior notes due and used the proceeds to fund a portion of our tender offer for our senior notes due we completed an amendment to our credit facility which included re pricing the revolver and a two year maturity extension for all facilities under the credit facility the interest rate and fees for borrowings and letters of credit under the revolver were reduced by basis points in addition our fee for the unused portion of the revolver was reduced by basis points we expensed approximately million of costs related to premiums paid table of contents write off of deferred financing and other costs in connection with these transactions we expect the refinancing transactions to generate approximately million in annual interest savings in may we renewed and increased our accounts receivable securitization program from million to million additionally we increased the accounts receivable securitization program by million to million in october during the third and fourth quarters of we made prepayments of million and million respectively on the term loan these payments were made with excess cash flow from operations and proceeds from the upsizing of our securitization program and the sale of assets in september we redeemed million of senior notes due with available cash and a temporary borrowing under the revolver we expensed million of costs related to premiums paid write off of deferred financing

exempt bonds with an aggregate value of million the proceeds of which are used to finance qualifying expenditures at our landfills transfer and hauling facilities the tax exempt bonds mature between

indentures relating to our senior notes contain financial covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions pay dividends incur indebtedness make investments and take certain other corporate actions see note long term debt to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our primary financial covenants at december we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facility we are not subject to any minimum net worth covenants failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facility as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under the credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement this could also have an adverse impact on availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on the credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore these would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration of maturities were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under the credit facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity and or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the credit facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated prepayments under our credit facility if we generate cash flow in excess of specified levels we must prepay a portion of our term loan borrowings annually prior to the stated maturity to make these payments if required we may have to use the revolver to accommodate cash timing differences factors primarily increasing excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement could include increases in operating cash flow lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements net divestitures or other favorable cash generating activities in addition we are required to make prepayments on the credit facility upon completion of certain transactions as defined in the credit agreement including asset sales and issuances of debt securities financial assurances we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and post closure costs and or related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy the financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies or trust deposits the table of contents amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and post closure costs is determined by the applicable state environmental regulations which vary by state the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and post closure costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurances required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurances during although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change at december we had the following financial assurance instruments and collateral in place in millions landfill closure contract riskcasualty collateral for post closure performance insurance obligations total insurance policies surety bonds trust deposits letters of credit total these amounts were issued under the revolver the incremental revolving letter of credit and the institutional letter of credit facility under our credit facility these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of our company since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations we do not expect this to occur off balance sheet financing we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position we do not guarantee any third party debt interest rate risk management we believe it is important to have a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to provide financing flexibility our policy requires that no less than of our total debt is fixed either directly or effectively through interest rate swap agreements at december approximately of our debt was fixed all directly from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging variability of interest expense and interest payments on our long term variable rate bank debt and maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt our strategy is to use interest rate swap agreements when such transactions will serve to reduce our aggregate exposure and meet the objectives of our interest rate policy these contracts are not entered into for trading purposes at december we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding table of contents contingencies for a description of our commitments and contingencies see note income taxes and note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k related party transactions for a description of related party transactions see note related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our financial position and results of operations and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our reportable segments we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in these accounting policies residual accounting and business risk is defined as the inherent risk that we face after the application of our policies and processes which is generally outside of our control or forecasting ability landfill accounting landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein our landfill assets fall into the following two categories each of which require accounting judgments and estimates landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset we use the life cycle accounting method for our landfills and the related capping closure and post closure liabilities in life cycle accounting all capitalizable costs to acquire develop and retire close and monitor a site are recorded as amortization expense as disposal capacity is consumed estimates of future landfill disposal capacity are updated periodically at least annually based on aerial surveys landfill development costs site permit in order to develop construct and operate a landfill we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs prior to the receipt of all required permits residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process these changes could make it more difficult and or costly to obtain a landfill permit table of contents studies performed could be inaccurate which could result in the revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions conditions could exist that were not identified in the study which make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the revocation of a permit revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset actions by neighboring parties private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain maintain or expand permits could result in revocation or suspension of a permit which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit improved technical information as a project progresses or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project which could result in an asset impairment technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design these changes could make it more difficult and or costly to meet new design standards technical design requirements as approved may need modifications at some future point in time technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs or difficulty in obtaining a permit landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill residual risks estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions including waste compaction practices site design climate and the nature of the waste capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons the number of tonscubic yard varies by type of waste development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred table of contents residual risk actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions regulatory changes or legislative changes landfill development asset amortization in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfills operating life the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfills estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based upon market value amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors residual risk changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in an asset impairment on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually landfill retirement obligations we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure monitoring landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above residual risk changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping closure activities or post closure monitoring activities types and quantities of materials used or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates closure and post closure monitoring closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is closed we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period which generally extends for years costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap table of contents landfill retirement obligation liabilityasset estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually in both and the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill capping closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred in and in the retirement obligation is increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liability this accretion expense is charged to cost of operations actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liability as they are made a corresponding retirement obligation asset is recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and post closure liabilities the retirement obligation asset is amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the recorded retirement obligation assets net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill residual risks actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping closure and post closure liabilities changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities assets and expense changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow cost estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design post closure monitoring requirements or the inflation or discount rate on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and post closure liabilities and corresponding retirement obligation asset changes in the asset resulting in changes to the amortization rates are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed disposal capacity as described previously disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates which relate to table of contents additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought all geological and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met or an exception from such requirements has been received or can reasonably be expected to be received the political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved we are actively pursuing the expansion permit and have an expectation that the final local state and federal permits will be received within the next five years senior operations management approval has been obtained after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and post closure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity residual risk we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated both costs and disposal capacity will change which will generally increase the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping closure and post closure accruals an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment environmental liabilities environmental liabilities arise from contamination existing at our landfills or at third party landfills or other sites that we or a predecessor company have delivered waste to these liabilities are based on our estimates of future costs that we will incur for remediation activities and the related litigation costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the extent of contamination at each identified site the most appropriate remedy the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable residual risks actual settlement of these liabilities could differ from estimates due to a number of uncertainties such as the extent of contamination at a particular site the final remedy the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties actual amounts could differ from the estimated liability as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution including both legal and remedial costs an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to operating expense table of contents we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood and amounts of remediation as necessary as the timing of cash payments for these liabilities is uncertain the liabilities are not discounted changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made summary we have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of december and of approximately million and million respectively represents the most probable outcome of these matters cash paid for environmental matters during and was million and million respectively we do not expect that adjustments to estimates which are reasonably possible in the near term and that may result in changes to recorded amounts will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity financial position or results of operations however based on our review of the variability inherent in these estimates we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate outcome of environmental matters excluding capping closure and post closure costs could result in approximately million of additional liability due to the nature of these matters the cash flow impact would not be immediate and would most likely occur over a period greater than five years self insurance liabilities and related costs we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability automobile liability and workers compensation coverages ranging from million to million we determine our insurance claim liabilities primarily based upon our past claims experience which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims our insurance claim liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis we are the primary obligor for payment of all claims therefore we report our insurance claim liabilities on a gross basis in other current and long term liabilities and any associated recoveries from our insurers in other assets as of december and we had approximately million and million of insurance claim liabilities and amounts due from insurers of million and million on our balance sheet cash paid for insurance claims during and was million and million respectively residual risks incident rates including frequency and severity could increase or decrease during a year causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to increase or decrease the settlement costs to discharge our obligations including legal and health care costs could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance liability to change loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liability managements assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable if a contingent liability is only reasonably possible we will disclose the potential range of the loss if estimable we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency table of contents residual risks actual costs can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by their nature unpredictable if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial position and result of operations in the period or periods in which such judgment or settlement occurs asset impairment valuation methodology we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets residual risk if events or changes in circumstances occur including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings evaluation criteria we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life residual risk our most significant asset impairment exposure other than goodwill see discussion below relates to our landfills a significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments or density changes could trigger an impairment charge recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value goodwill recoverability valuation methodology we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit we define reporting units as our five geographic operating segments we estimate fair value based on projected net cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital which was approximately in and in residual risk the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change with changes in our capital structure cost of debt interest rates actual capital expenditure levels ability to perform at levels that were forecasted or our market capitalization for example a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting units to below their carrying value which would trigger an impairment charge similarly an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment charge table of contents evaluation criteria we test goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable for example a significant adverse change in our liquidity or the business environment unanticipated competition a significant adverse action by a regulator or the disposal of a significant portion of a reporting unit could prompt an impairment test between annual assessments recognition criteria we recognize an impairment if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds the related fair value at the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within a reporting unit goodwill of the reporting unit is allocated to that business unit based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to the total fair value of the reporting unit and a gain or loss on disposal is determined subsequently the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment which could result in an impairment charge residual risk in the past we have incurred non cash losses on sales of business units driven primarily by the goodwill allocated to the business units divested if similar divestitures are made in the future we could incur additional non cash losses summary at december and we had recorded goodwill of billion and billion respectively all of which was considered to be recoverable from future operations based on estimated future discounted cash flow income taxes we account for income taxes using a balance sheet approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than non deductible goodwill and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets including net operating loss capital loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the future benefits giving rise to the deferred tax asset we account for income tax uncertainties under fasb interpretation fin no accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no fin which provides guidance on the recognition derecognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions we recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense residual risks the balance sheet classification and amount of the income tax accounts established relating to acquisitions are based on certain assumptions that could possibly change based on the ultimate outcome of certain tax matters as these tax accounts were established in purchase accounting future changes relating to these amounts will result in an adjustment to goodwill through december effective january such adjustments will be charged or credited to earnings pursuant to sfas r business combinations changes in estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to income tax expense we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years the internal revenue code irc and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge accordingly we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken and benefited under fin are disallowed by the taxing authorities table of contents summary as of december we have federal and state net operating loss capital loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards with an after tax benefit totaling million most of which will expire if not used valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that certain of the state carryforwards may not be used also as of december we had unrecognized tax benefits of million defined benefit pension plans we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan bfi pension plan as a result of allieds acquisition of bfi in the bfi pension plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plans benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon acquisition our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the internal revenue code irc as amended by the pension protection act of no contributions were required during the last three years and no contributions are anticipated for the pension plans assets are invested as determined our retirement benefits committee at december approximately of the total plan assets of million were invested in fixed income bond funds and approximately in equity funds we annually review and adjust the plans asset allocation as deemed necessary residual risk changes in the plans investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and of fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the pension plan are determined based on assumptions such as discount rate expected rate of return and average rate of compensation increase we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the pension plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate increases or decreases by our benefit obligation would decrease or increase by million in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate long term expected and historical actual returns on the plan assets which give consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of our plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned less than of plan participants continue to earn service benefits our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary assumptions used to determine our defined benefit pension obligations are as follows percent discount rate average rate of compensation increase table of contents assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost are as follows percent discount rate average rate of compensation increase expected return on plan assets residual risks our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates a decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets varies from the expected returns we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans in our balance sheet in accordance with the recognition provisions of sfas no employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no and r sfas we will change our measurement date for the benefits obligations to our year end reporting date for the year ending december in accordance with the measurement provisions of sfas we plan on utilizing the one measurement approach under which we measured our benefits obligations as of september and will recognize the net benefit expense for the transition period from october to december in retained earnings as of december new accounting

or decrease by approximately million million after tax this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings see note long term debt to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding how we manage interest rate risk fuel prices fuel costs represent a significant operating expense historically we have mitigated fuel cost exposure with fixed price purchase contracts these contracts expired in the first quarter of when economically practical we may enter into new or renewal contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in an increase in our costs of operations a smaller increase in our revenues from the fuel recovery fee and a decrease in our operating margin percentage since the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in a decrease in our costs of operations a smaller decrease in our revenues and an increase in our operating margin percentage at our current consumption levels a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million million after tax on an annual basis which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenues and costs of operations commodities prices we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities as a result changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations revenues from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in and were approximately million and million respectively table of contents
