that may affect future results in item of this report beginning on page and the risks discussed in the risk factors sections included in the companys registration statement on form s as declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on november reg no general cardiometrics was founded in to develop a catheter based system for the continuous measurement of cardiac output utilizing doppler ultrasound techniques in cardiometrics discontinued development of its continuous cardiac output measurement device due to cardiometrics assessment of the products inability to meet the performance expectations of the market at this time cardiometrics restructured its operations under new management to focus on a new business strategy the development and commercialization of the flowireflomap system in cardiometrics received fda k clearance for its flowire and began marketing and selling the flowire primarily to clinical research sites in the us europe and japan during the japanese ministry of health granted the flowireflomap system official reimbursement status resulting in significant sales growth in japan and in the us and cardiometrics received fda clearance for its flowire in cardiometrics substantially increased its manufacturing capacity including adding a second shift to meet significant back orders for the flowire product in japan after supplying the flowire devices to meet the back orders cardiometrics adjusted its manufacturing capacity to one shift and reduced its manufacturing headcount during increasing uncertainty concerning health care reform slowed capital expenditures on medical equipment in the united states in response cardiometrics changed its us marketing approach in from a capital equipment focus to an emphasis on routine clinical usage of the flowire and resulting sales of disposable devices in the us market cardiometrics began offering hospitals the option to obtain the use of the flomap in exchange for a commitment to purchase a minimum number of flowire devices per month for a period of one to two years this change was accompanied by a reduction and reorganization of the us sales force and resulted in a decrease in flomap sales in cardiometrics continued to invest in clinical outcome studies and to develop its sales and marketing capabilities in august cardiometrics introduced its flomap ii product a compact version of the flomap for installation in each cath lab room at a lower price point than the portable but freestanding flomap in november cardiometrics completed an initial public offering of shares of common stock with net proceeds of million based on the outcome of the debate clinical study presented in early cardiometrics began to focus its sales and marketing efforts on the use of the flowire to assess post procedural results of angioplasty to support this new focus two new clinical studies destini cfr and debate ii were started in the second half of in december cardiometrics filed a fda k premarket notification for the wavewirewavemap pressure system and its first clinical use was demonstrated in europe during the same month on january cardiometrics endosonics corporation a delaware corporation endosonics and river acquisition corporation a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of endosonics merger sub entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization the reorganization agreement pursuant to which merger sub will be merged with and into cardiometrics the merger with cardiometrics surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of endosonics the consummation of the merger is subject among other things to the approval of the merger by the stockholders of cardiometrics at a stockholders meeting currently expected to be held in may and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions cardiometrics has not been profitable since inception and as of december had an accumulated deficit of million million of which has been incurred since cardiometrics restructured its operations in further growth in the sales volume of cardiometrics products and the resulting gross profit will be needed to offset future investments in research and development principally clinical outcome studies and selling general and administrative expenses results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected statement of operations information of cardiometrics as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated year ended december percentage of sales sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest income expense net net loss year ended december compared to year ended december sales sales increased during the period ended december over the period ended december to from this increase was primarily the result of an increase in sales of flowire units primarily in japan and the us and to a lesser extent an increase in the average realized selling price of flowire units these increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of accutrac smartmap and smartwire units cost of sales cost of sales increased during the period ended december over the period ended december to from cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to in the period ended december from in the period ended december this decrease was the result of a greater percentage of flowire sales which carry higher gross margins than instrument sales the decrease was also the result of unit manufacturing cost reductions for flowire devices these cost reductions were achieved through lower manufacturing overhead cost per unit due to increased volumes research and development research and development expenses increased for the period ended december over the period ended december to from as a percentage of sales research and development expenses increased to in the period ending december from in the period ended december the increase was primarily the result of increased spending on clinical studies which cardiometrics includes in research and development expenses these studies include destini cfr and debate ii which were new studies commenced in and which will continue in and the increase in research and development was also the result of and increased spending for personnel and outside services related to new product development cardiometrics plans to continue its expenditures in research and development including additional clinical studies selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses increased in the period ended december over the period ended december to from as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased to in the period

angioplasty guide wire cost of sales cost of sales increased during the period ended december over the period ended december to from cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to in the period ended december from in the period ended december this decrease is principally the result of unit manufacturing cost reductions for flowire devices these cost reductions were achieved through lower manufacturing overhead cost per unit due to increased volumes and manufacturing efficiencies such as just in time techniques to reduce throughput time improved yields reduced scrap costs and out sourcing of non proprietary fabrication and assembly processes research and development research and development expenses decreased for the period ended december over the period ended december to from as a percentage of sales research and development expenses decreased to in the period ending december from in the period ended december the decrease was primarily due to a temporary reduction in spending on clinical studies which cardiometrics includes in research and development expenses as a result of the completion of patient recruitment for major studies started in and selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses increased in the period ended december over the period ended december to from as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased the increase in selling and marketing expenses relates primarily to increased sales volume and additional sales and marketing programs commenced in late and early liquidity and capital resources since inception cardiometrics has financed its operations primarily through the private sales of equity securities raising approximately million and through an initial public offering in november with net proceeds of approximately million in addition cardiometrics has financed a substantial portion of its capital equipment requirements to date through notes payable issued under a million equipment loan and security agreement in and cardiometrics cash used in operations was and respectively the decrease in cash used in operations from to was primarily due to increases in product sales and gross margin improvements which were partially offset by increases in net inventory and accounts receivable at december cardiometrics principal sources of liquidity included an aggregate of in cash cash equivalents and short term investments cardiometrics expects to incur substantial additional costs including costs related to sales and marketing and research and development including additional clinical outcome studies and the purchase of capital equipment cardiometrics believes that the remaining net proceeds of the november initial public offering will provide sufficient funds for cardiometrics anticipated funding requirements through at least and for the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that cardiometrics will not require additional financing or that if required such financing will be available on terms acceptable to cardiometrics
