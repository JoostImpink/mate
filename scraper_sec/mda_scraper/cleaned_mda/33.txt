item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed under item a risk factors in this annual report on form k overview we are engaged in the design manufacture and supply of communications equipment services and systems for global communications infrastructure markets our products are used in the infrastructure for traditional wireless networks third generation g technologies voice data video and internet services as well as applications for microwave and satellite communications and other specialized applications we operate in two groups comprised of five reportable segments our antenna and cable and satellite communications segments comprise our antenna and cable products group and our base station subsystems network solutions and wireless innovations segments comprise our wireless network solutions group with the exception of satellite communications all of our operating segments sell products and services to the wireless infrastructure market our financial results are influenced by factors in the markets in which we operate and by our ability to successfully execute our business strategy marketplace factors include competition for customers raw material prices product and price competition economic conditions in various geographic regions foreign currency exchange rates interest rates changes in technology fluctuations in customer demand patent and intellectual property issues litigation results and legal and regulatory developments we expect that the marketplace environment will remain highly competitive our ability to execute our business strategy successfully will require that we meet a number of challenges including our ability to accurately forecast sales demand and calibrate our manufacturing to such demand develop manufacture and successfully market new and enhanced products and product lines control overhead spending successfully integrate acquired businesses and attract motivate and retain key personnel to manage our operational financial and management information systems on november we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our satellite communications business to resilience capital partners resilience we expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar year in fiscal we acquired ems wireless ems a division of ems technologies inc a major designer and manufacturer of base station antennas based in norcross georgia in fiscal we completed a number of acquisitions we acquired skyware radio systems gmbh skyware a german manufacturer of electronic products for broadband satellite communications networks and precision antennas ltd precision a stratford england based designer and manufacturer of microwave antennas for use in carrying point to point radio signals primarily for cellular network backhaul we also acquired cellsite industries csi a provider of wireless equipment repair services we believe the acquisition of csi provides us with a lower cost platform for warranty and repair services on june we entered into a definitive merger agreement with commscope inc commscope under the terms of the agreement each share of andrew common stock will be converted into the right to receive comprised of per share in cash and an additional per share in either cash commscope common stock or a combination of cash and commscope common stock totaling per share at commscopes election the merger agreement contains termination rights for both commscope and andrew under certain circumstances including if our board of directors recommends a superior proposal to our stockholders and the merger agreement is terminated as a result thereof we would be required to pay commscope a termination fee of million following the close of the transaction andrew will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of commscope the merger is subject to regulatory and governmental reviews in the united states and elsewhere as well as approval by andrews shareholders table of contents results of operations our sales for fiscal were million an increase of from fiscal the sales increase resulted from incremental year over year sales from recent acquisitions of approximately million a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately million and increased organic sales growth of microwave and base station antennas these sales increases were offset by sales declines in base station subsystems and satellite communications products wireless infrastructure capital investment continued to grow in fiscal across all major geographic regions except for north america which was impacted by a reduction in spending by two key customers of over million compared to fiscal the fundamental sources of wireless infrastructure and network growth include increased minutes of usage increased use of data applications and the global growth of wireless subscribers sales for fiscal were million an increase of from fiscal the sales increase resulted from higher sales in antenna and cable products and base station subsystems offset by an expected sales decline in network solutions our top customers accounted for of our sales in fiscal compared to of sales in both fiscal and major oems accounted for of our sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and ericsson and nokia siemens networks accounted for and of our sales respectively in fiscal no single customer accounted for more than of sales in fiscal in fiscal cingular wireless accounted for of total sales gross profit margin was in fiscal a decrease of basis points from our fiscal gross profit margin of due mainly to a geographic mix shift in sales and approximately million of costs associated with our transition to new cable and antenna manufacturing facilities in joliet illinois and goa india gross profit margins decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal due primarily to higher commodity costs especially copper and a decrease in network solutions margin contribution resulting from the completion of united states us e upgrade installations operating expenses were million in fiscal included in operating expenses were million of non cash asset impairments to reduce goodwill and other long lived assets to their fair value including million of goodwill and million of capitalized software for base station subsystems million for satellite communications goodwill intangibles and long lived assets and million of intangible assets and a product license for network solutions also included in fiscal operating expenses were million of litigation expenses related to our intellectual property litigation with trueposition including a million jury award and million of external legal costs and million of expenses related to the merger agreement with commscope sales and administrative expenses were million or of sales in fiscal compared to million or of sales in fiscal primarily due to decreased incentive compensation accruals research and development expense was million compared to million in fiscal operating expenses were million in fiscal or of sales compared with million in fiscal or of sales operating expenses increased million compared to fiscal due primarily to higher sales and administrative costs which increased from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal research and development expenses increased million in fiscal versus fiscal but decreased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of million and million in fiscal and respectively we recorded a loss on the sale of assets of million in income tax expense was million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in income tax expense in fiscal was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets in fiscal we recorded tax expense in international jurisdictions where we are profitable while we did not record a tax benefit for losses incurred in the us and other jurisdictions where cumulative losses in recent years have resulted in a determination that it is more likely than not that we will not realize those benefits in future periods diluted loss per share was in fiscal and in fiscal compared to earnings per share of in fiscal table of contents sales for our five operating segments for the last three fiscal years were as follows dollars in millions change change antenna and cable products antenna and cable satellite communications total antenna and cable products wireless network solutions base station subsystems network solutions wireless innovations total wireless network solutions total sales sales by segment antenna and cable sales were million in fiscal a increase from fiscal strong microwave antenna base station antenna and coaxial cable sales including incremental year over year sales increases of million from the april acquisition of precision and million from the december ems acquisition were partially offset by lower sales of cable assemblies and accessories and a decrease in field services in fiscal the europe middle east and africa emea asia pacific and latin america regions had strong sales growth compared to fiscal partially offset by lower sales in north america sales were million in fiscal an increase of from fiscal due to growth in all geographic markets the largest growth areas in terms of sales dollars contributed were the emea region followed by asia pacific and north american regions the largest product line sales increases were in the coaxial cable and microwave antenna product lines the increase in emea sales was also the result of our acquisition of precision antenna ltd in april which contributed million of revenues in fiscal satellite communications sales were million in fiscal a decrease of from fiscal the primary decrease was in direct to home products in the north america region sales were million in fiscal a decrease of compared to fiscal sales gains in earth station electronics and very small aperture antennas were offset by sales decreases in consumer broadband earth station antenna and mobile antenna products the earth station electronics increase in sales was the result of the february skyware acquisition the decrease in mobile antenna products was the result of andrew exiting that business in fiscal base station subsystems sales were million in fiscal a decrease of from fiscal decreased sales of filters and power amplifiers primarily in the us from two key customers were partially offset by approximately million of incremental year over year sales from the acquisition of csi in may base station sales decreases in the north america and emea regions were partially offset by increased sales in the asia pacific region sales were million in fiscal an increase of from fiscal primarily due to higher filter and power amplifier sales in north america which was offset by decreased sales in emea network solutions sales were million in fiscal a decrease of from fiscal the decline in sales was due to lower geolocation product sales and maintenance contract renewals primarily in the north america market partially offset by increased sales of geolocation products in the middle east and increased service revenue sales decreased million in fiscal or versus fiscal due primarily to a decline in north american geolocation installations as major us service providers completed their e equipment upgrades that were mandated by the us government additionally if we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the trueposition litigation ruling our sales of geolocation products may be adversely affected wireless innovations sales were million in fiscal an increase of from fiscal increased repeater product sales were partially offset by decreased project revenue in fiscal higher asia pacific and north america sales were partially offset by sales decreases in the emea region as compared to fiscal sales were million in fiscal up from fiscal due to increased radiaxreg sales and repeater product sales primarily in north america and emea both of which have experienced increased demand for greater wireless communication coverage in densely populated urban areas table of contents sales by major geographic region dollars in millions change change americas europe middle east africa emea asia pacific total sales sales in the americas decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to decreases across all segments except wireless innovations sales to two key customers in north america decreased over million year over year this was partially offset by increases in sales in latin america increased repeater sales and sales from the acquisition of ems in december sales in the americas increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to strong growth in antenna and cable products power amplifiers and filter sales which were offset by sales decreases in geolocation equipment and satellite products emea sales were million in fiscal an increase of from fiscal due to increased antenna and cable sales as well as the completion of the initial phase of a significant middle east geolocation project partially offset by decreased base station subsystems and wireless innovation sales emea sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to strong antenna and cable sales primarily resulting from the acquisition of precision offset by lower sales of base station subsystems sales asia pacific sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased sales of antenna and cable and base station subsystems products sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased antenna and cable sales primarily in india indonesia and china gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal in fiscal and in fiscal over the past three years rising commodity costs specifically copper changing product mix and geographic sales mix were significant factors that have adversely impacted our gross profit the price of copper has increased over over the past two years we have seen a decrease in higher margin geolocation sales as us service providers have implemented and completed e upgrade installations partially offset by lower margin international geolocation sales in addition gross profit margin decreased in fiscal due to approximately million of costs incurred to relocate to two new facilities in joliet illinois and goa india other major factors that have contributed to the decline in gross margin over the past three years are continued price pressure and higher prices of aluminum petro chemicals and other commodities in the last three years we have experienced significant variability in new lower margin products and services which have put downward pressure on our gross profit margin percentages gross profit by segment gross profit margins vary across our operating segments generally network solutions and wireless innovations gross profit margin percentages are above the corporate average network solutions fiscal gross margin decreased basis points from fiscal the lower margin was due to decreased volume and a change in the geographic mix of sales as higher margin us geolocation sales were partially replaced with less profitable international geolocation sales in fiscal gross margin decreased by basis points in fiscal versus combined with lower fiscal revenues network solutions fiscal gross profit dollar contribution decreased or million versus fiscal wireless innovations gross margin increased basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal due to strong repeater product sales gross margin increased in fiscal by basis points versus fiscal primarily due to higher sales of higher margin radiaxreg cable and repeater products table of contents antenna and cables gross margin was slightly below the corporate average at for fiscal primarily due to increased commodity costs and approximately million of costs to relocate to new manufacturing facilities in joliet illinois and goa india these increased costs were partially offset by increased production efficiencies in the new facilities in fiscal gross margin was consistent with the corporate average rate of but declined slightly by basis points versus fiscal due to higher raw material costs we use commodities such as copper and petrochemicals in the manufacture of our cable products the most significant of these commodities is copper the market price of copper has increased from per pound as of september to per pound as of september an increase of over the two year period we took steps to mitigate the impact of rising copper prices by implementing a copper surcharge and price increase program in fiscal with all customers in all markets implementation of this copper surcharge and price increase program enabled us to partially offset the large increase in the cost of copper to mitigate some of the fluctuation in copper prices we buy copper on a forward purchase contract basis for a portion of our projected needs additionally our cable sales in international markets as a percentage of total sales have increased in each of the last three years this has negatively impacted our overall gross margins as certain international service providers generally use smaller diameter lower margin cable in their networks base station subsystems is comprised of active components such as filters and power amplifiers that carry a lower gross margin than the overall corporate average base station subsystems gross margins decreased basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal due to decreased overall sales volumes higher inventory reserves for slow moving products and a less favorable product mix margins increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased warranty and product recall costs additionally we transitioned considerable filter production to our china facility and in fiscal we experienced positive results from this transition satellite communications is our lowest gross profit margin segment in fiscal gross margin increased basis points from fiscal due to a sales reduction in lower margin dth products in fiscal margins in this segment decreased basis points versus fiscal primarily due to higher per unit manufacturing costs of our dth satellite products additional costs related to a long term customer contract and transition costs related to our acquisition of skyware research and development rd expenses were million in fiscal a decrease of approximately million from fiscal lower rd spending for base station subsystems and network solutions was partially offset by increased rd costs in the other segments rd expenses were of sales in fiscal of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal while research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of sales they increased million in fiscal or from fiscal the majority of our research and development spending over the last three years has been focused on our active electronic components especially amplifiers filters and repeaters and related products we have continued to invest heavily in the development of new products specifically our base station antenna and repeater products sales and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in fiscal in fiscal and in fiscal sales and administrative expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased incentive compensation expense in fiscal sales and administrative costs increased million or from fiscal factors causing this increase were higher sales expenses to support sales growth in emerging markets and the growing direct to carrier sales channels higher administrative costs of recent acquisitions that had not been fully integrated and million of incremental stock option expense intangible amortization was million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal intangible amortization is primarily related to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the allen telecom and celiant acquisitions the decrease in intangible amortization in fiscal and was due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions excluding any new acquisitions we expect that intangible amortization will decrease to approximately million in fiscal as more intangible assets become fully amortized restructuring expenses were million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal these costs are primarily severance and other costs associated with integrating our acquisitions streamlining operations and other cost cutting initiatives the expense during fiscal related to the following segments base station subsystems million antenna and cable million and unallocated sales and administrative and other segments million the majority of the base station subsystems expense resulted from the downsizing of our filter operations in italy and mexico the other expenses were primarily due to cost cutting initiatives to reduce headcount in specific departments we believe that the outsourcing of filter production and the shifting of production to our low cost china facility as well as reduced overhead costs associated with these headcount reductions will increase the future profitability of base station subsystems we currently estimate the annual benefit from these cost savings to be approximately million which we began to realize in the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal we incurred million of severance costs as part of a plan to reorganize our management and operating groups in addition to other cost cutting initiatives during the year table of contents merger costs were million in fiscal consisting of legal and other external costs associated with our pending merger with commscope merger costs were million in fiscal due to a million fee to terminate our proposed merger with adc telecommunications inc and other legal and professional costs related to the merger agreement litigation expenses were million in fiscal these costs relate to external legal expenses and a million accrual of the unfavorable judgment in the intellectual property litigation with trueposition asset impairment charges were million in fiscal consisting of non cash asset impairments recorded to reduce goodwill and other long lived assets to fair value including million of goodwill and million of capitalized software costs for base station subsystems million for satellite communications goodwill intangible and long lived assets and million of intangible assets and a product license for network solutions in fiscal asset impairment charges were million for impaired software costs that were capitalized in accordance with sfas no accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed the capitalized software impairment charges are for products that we no longer emphasize and for which the future undiscounted cash flows no longer support the assets carrying value pension termination gain was million in fiscal as a result of eliminating pension obligations due to the termination of the frozen allen telecom defined benefit plan in fiscal we initiated the process of terminating the frozen defined benefit plan assumed as part of the allen telecom acquisition we fully funded and terminated the plan during fiscal when we purchased a non participating group annuity contract from john hancock life insurance company for all participants of the allen telecom plan in fiscal we made additional contributions of million to fully fund the plan gain loss on the sale of assets was a gain of million in fiscal a gain of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal the fiscal gain was primarily the result of the fee we received from the cancellation of the sale of land in orland park illinois and the sale of our broadband cable product line the gain in fiscal was primarily the result of the million gain on the sale of a portion of land at our orland park illinois facility in fiscal we recorded a loss of million from the sale and disposition of certain manufacturing assets see note sale of assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements operating income loss was a loss of million in fiscal and income of million and million in fiscal and respectively we use operating income as our internal measurement of segment profit and loss operating income loss by operating segment for the last three years is as follows dollars in millions antenna and cable products antenna and cable satellite communications total antenna and cable products wireless network solutions base station subsystems network solutions wireless innovations total wireless network solutions items not included in segments unallocated sales and administrative costs intangible amortization merger costs pension termination gain loss on sale of assets total operating income loss for purposes of internal management reporting we do not allocate costs that benefit more than one operating segment costs such as finance accounting human resources information systems legal and executive management are not allocated to operating segments the only sales and administrative expense that is allocated to operating segments is the cost of our global sales force which sells all of our products antenna and cables operating income has increased over the last three years due to sales growth partially offset by declining gross profit margins table of contents base station subsystems operating loss in fiscal was due to lower sales and gross profit margins and the asset impairment charges of million for goodwill and million for capitalized software costs operating loss decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased direct to carrier revenues lower warranty costs and higher margins resulting from the transition of substantial filter manufacturing operations to china in fiscal base station subsystems operating loss was a result of higher warranty costs a decrease in filter margins and costs associated with moving filter production to china network solutions operating loss in fiscal was primarily the result of a million accrual for the trueposition intellectual property litigation million of asset impairments and continued decreases in north american geolocation sales operating income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as geolocation sales decreased as a result of the anticipated decline in north american geolocation installations continuing a trend from fiscal most us service providers have substantially completed their e equipment upgrades in fiscal that were mandated by the us government wireless innovations operating income has continued to grow as this segments sales have increased over the last three years profit resulting from higher sales volume was partially offset by increased rd expenses satellite communications operating loss in fiscal included million of asset impairment charges and an million loss from operations the fiscal million loss from operations was consistent with fiscal operating loss increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to decreased sales and higher cost of sales due to higher per unit manufacturing costs of dth satellite products additional costs related to a long term customer contract and transition costs related to our acquisition of skyware unallocated sales and administrative costs were million in fiscal a decrease of million from fiscal primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense unallocated sales and administrative costs increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher administrative costs of recent acquisitions that had not been fully integrated and million of incremental stock option expense unallocated sales and administrative costs have decreased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to of sales in fiscal and in fiscal other expenses primarily consist of interest expense interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses other expenses were million in fiscal and interest expense was million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal the largest portion of our interest expense was related to the million of convertible notes issued in august and the long term debt assumed from allen telecom interest income was million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income in fiscal included million of interest received from a favorable resolution of certain tax related matters other expenses were million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal the majority of other expenses were foreign exchange gains and losses the foreign exchange losses in fiscal and were primarily due to movements in the british pound euro and indian rupee against the us dollar income tax expense was million million and million in fiscal and respectively and as a percentage of pre tax income loss from continuing operations was in fiscal in fiscal and in fiscal the negative income tax rate for fiscal results from the inability to book net tax benefits for losses in the us and other jurisdictions to offset the tax expense recorded on income in jurisdictions where we have been historically profitable income tax expense for fiscal was higher than the statutory rate due to an million charge to establish a full valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax assets and the establishment of valuation allowances for the tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions which offset the favorable impact of foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates and a million tax benefit from repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings under the american jobs creation act of the effective tax rate for fiscal was higher than the statutory rate due to an unfavorable geographic mix shift of earnings and the establishment of valuation allowances for tax benefits associated with state and foreign losses our effective tax rate is materially affected by the level of pre tax income or loss generated in the us the earnings mix in foreign countries where the statutory rates are higher or lower than the federal statutory rate and by changes in tax laws to the extent we are able to generate taxable income in the us or other jurisdictions in which we have recorded valuation allowances against our deferred taxes our tax provision will be reduced due to reductions of the valuation allowance as our deferred tax assets are utilized we are subject to examination of our tax filings by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities we regularly review and assess the potential outcome of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves table of contents net income loss available to common shareholders was a loss of million and million in fiscal and respectively net income available to common shareholders was million in fiscal and includes preferred stock dividends of million as part of the allen telecom acquisition we issued shares of convertible preferred stock issuing one share for each share of allen telecom convertible preferred stock in fiscal we converted all remaining convertible preferred shares into andrew common shares liquidity and capital resources we generated million of cash from operations in fiscal despite the significant loss from operations cash and cash equivalents were million at september a decrease of million from september working capital was million at september compared to million at september the significant decrease in working capital is due to the classification of our million convertible subordinated notes as current liabilities on the balance sheet as of september as the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes in august however we anticipate that these notes will be converted to equity or repurchased in connection with the commscope acquisition we believe that our working capital position ability to generate cash flow from operations and ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement will allow us to meet our normal operating cash flow needs for the foreseeable future in fiscal we entered into a new million revolving credit agreement with a group of lenders that expires in september discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the terms of this facility we are subject to various quarterly covenant requirements including maintaining a ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda to total debt including letters of credit maintaining a ratio of ebitda to senior debt maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio and limiting the amount of assets that we can dispose of in a fiscal year these requirements may limit the amount of borrowing under this credit agreement as of september we were in violation of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant principally due to the million liability recorded for the trueposition intellectual property litigation and the classification of convertible notes as current liabilities as the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes in august we obtained a waiver from the lenders that allows us to utilize the entire million until the earlier of december or the closing of the proposed commscope transaction in fiscal we filed a universal shelf registration statement that allows us to publicly issue up to million of debt or equity through december this shelf registration statement gives us the flexibility to take advantage of strategic initiatives and other favorable long term opportunities to enhance liquidity cash flows the following table sets forth certain information from our consolidated statements of cash flows dollars in millions net income loss non cash charges for depreciation amortization asset sales gains losses pension termination gain stock based compensation asset impairments and deferred income taxes restructuring costs change in operating assets and liabilities net cash from operations net cash used for investing activities net cash from used for financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash decrease in cash for the period net cash from operations was million million and million in fiscal and respectively in fiscal cash from operations decreased compared to the prior year due to a larger net loss for the year in fiscal our net cash from operations was relatively flat compared to fiscal as increased sales and operating income was offset by higher inventory and accounts receivable amounts in emea and asia pacific to support our growing business in those geographic markets table of contents in fiscal cash flow from operations was due to a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for asset impairments and million for depreciation and amortization and million for stock based compensation operating assets and liabilities decreased cash flow from operations by million during fiscal operating asset and liability cash inflows were million due to a decrease in inventory caused by higher sales and million due to higher accrued liabilities which primarily resulted from the trueposition litigation expense these cash inflow amounts were offset by cash outflows of million due to an increase in accounts receivable caused by higher sales and million due to an increase in other assets caused by the timing of tax payments and receipts accounts receivable was million as of september compared to million as of september the fourth quarter of fiscal had record sales of million days sales outstanding dso was days as of september compared to days and days as of september and respectively the increase in dso is primarily due to a higher percentage of fiscal sales from the asia pacific and emea regions where collection terms are longer than in the us and consolidation of oems in the industry leading to longer payment cycles inventory decreased from million as of september to million as of september inventory turns were x at september compared to x and x at september and respectively in fiscal cash flow from operations was the result of a net loss of million million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization a gain on the sale of assets of million a million non cash gain on the termination of the allen telecom pension plan a net million non cash charge for deferred income taxes million stock based compensation cash restructuring costs of million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a million decrease in cash flow in fiscal cash flow from operations was the result of net income of million million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization a million non cash charge for deferred income taxes cash restructuring costs of million million of stock based compensation a loss on the sale of assets of million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a million decrease in cash flow to meet increased sales levels we increased inventory resulting in a million decrease in cash flow higher accounts payable and other liabilities increased cash flow by million recent legislation enacted in the united kingdom uk has accelerated the rate of funding required for the uk pension plan in march we proposed to the uk pensions regulator a plan to fund a pension deficit as of september by march in fiscal we made cash contributions of million the following schedule below shows the timing of the additional cash payments we currently intend to make the schedule is subject to change based on future valuations of the pension plan dollars in millions march march march contribution amount net cash used for investing activities was million million and million in fiscal and respectively we spent million on capital expenditures in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal we acquired ems for million and paid additional consideration of million for csi which was originally acquired in fiscal in fiscal we spent million on the acquisition of businesses in february we acquired skyware for million in april precision was acquired for million and csi for million in fiscal we spent million on acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal we acquired certain assets of atc tower services inc a provider of site installation services in north america for million in cash and the assumption of million in capital leases in the second quarter of fiscal we acquired xenicom ltd a united kingdom based provider of software solutions that help wireless operators plan launch and manage wireless networks for million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expanded our market leading geometrix mobile location system product line with the acquisition of certain assets of nortels mobile location business for million also in fiscal we acquired the remaining interest in a czech republic subsidiary that was acquired in the allen telecom acquisition for million finally we paid million for a yantai fine cable earn out payment in fiscal we received million from the maturity of our note receivable with cambridge positioning systems ltd table of contents proceeds from the sale of product lines were million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal we sold our yantai china facility and inventory and equipment related to our broadband cable product line the yantai sale to andes industries inc andes for million in cash and million of notes receivable payable over a two year period concurrent with the sale we exercised the conversion feature of a note receivable from andes obtained in a previous transaction for a equity ownership interest in andes the yantai sale resulted in a gain of million of which million was recorded in the statement of operations and the remaining million of the gain was recorded as a reduction of our investment in andes in fiscal we received net cash proceeds of million from the sale of selected assets of our mobile antenna product line to pctel inc proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment were million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal we received million in a sale lease back transaction of our joliet illinois facility and million for the sale cancellation and return of escrow funds for the second parcel of land in orland park illinois and million from the sale of other fixed assets in fiscal we sold a portion of land at our orland park illinois facility for million net of transaction costs and sold certain filter manufacturing assets and inventory to a contract manufacturer for million the most significant transactions in fiscal were the sale of a facility in reynosa mexico acquired from allen telecom the sale of unimproved land in suzhou china and the sale of a facility in livonia michigan that was acquired from allen telecom we paid million in fiscal and million in fiscal to settle patent infringement litigation with trueposition inc as part of litigation brought against allen telecom prior to the acquisition by us this settlement was accounted for as an increase in liabilities assumed from allen telecom net cash from financing activities was million in fiscal compared to a use of cash of million and million in fiscal and respectively we made payments on our long term debt of million million and million in fiscal and respectively we periodically borrow under our various credit agreements to meet our short term cash needs net borrowings under these credit agreements were million million and million in fiscal and respectively payments to acquire treasury shares were million for million shares in fiscal million for million shares in fiscal and million for million shares in fiscal we received cash from the sale of stock under employee and director option plans under these plans we received million million and million in fiscal and respectively payments for preferred stock dividends and conversion premium payments were million in fiscal dividend policy although we have never paid dividends to common shareholders the board of directors periodically reviews this practice and to date has elected to retain earnings in the business to finance future investments and operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the first footnote to our consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies describes the major accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements estimates are used for but not limited to accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts sales returns inventory reserves revenue recognition warranty costs depreciation and amortization goodwill and intangible impairments contingencies taxes pension liabilities and restructuring and merger integration costs actual results could differ materially from these estimates a material change in these or other estimates could potentially have a material impact on results of operations the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments assumptions and estimates revenue recognition during fiscal approximately of our total revenue was recognized when products were shipped and title passed based on statement of position sop no software revenue recognition based on eitf no revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables based on sop no accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and based on when services were performed table of contents revenue for software products is recognized pursuant to the provisions of sop no software revenue recognition and related interpretations the fair value of each revenue element is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value determined by stand alone pricing of each element these contracts typically contain post contract support pcs services which are sold both as part of a bundled product offering and as a separate contract revenue for pcs services is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs contract revenue for certain of our products relates to multiple element contracts the fair value of these revenue elements is based on negotiated contracts and stand alone pricing for each element allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable although we believe that the current allowance is sufficient to cover existing exposures there can be no assurance against the deterioration of a major customers creditworthiness or against defaults that are higher than what has been experienced historically if our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us are overstated it could have an adverse impact on results of operations inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out method inventory obsolescence reserves are maintained based on managements estimates historical experience and forecasted demand for our products a material change in these estimates could adversely impact gross profit warranty costs we offer warranties on most of our products the specific terms and conditions of these warranties vary depending upon the products sold we accrue for warranty costs based on the number of units sold the type of products sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim we regularly review these forecasts and makes adjustments as needed if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience gross profit could be adversely affected goodwill we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter july or at an interim date if circumstances dictate we manage our business as five operating segments in accordance with sfas no goodwill and other intangible assets we determined these operating segments were our reporting units we test each reporting unit for possible goodwill impairment by comparing each reporting units net book value to fair value the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the purpose of our annual or periodic analyses we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses as well as fair value on a comparable business basis we use both the discounted cash flow dcf method and the comparable business cb method for determining fair value of our reporting units the cb method is a valuation technique by which the fair value of the equity of a business is estimated by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business the multiples of key metrics of other similar companies revenue and or ebitda are generally applied to the historical or projected results of the business being valued to determine its fair market value the dcf method considers the future cash flow projections of the business and the value of those projections discounted to the present day while the use of historical results and future projections can result in different valuations for a company it is a generally accepted valuation practice to apply more than one valuation technique to establish a range of values for a business since each technique relies on different inputs and assumptions it is unlikely that each technique would yield the same results however it is expected that the different techniques would establish a reasonable range on at least an annual basis we assess the current business environment changes in the operations of each reporting unit deviations from projected results and the results of the prior year goodwill impairment test we then determine if the dcf method the cb method or both will be used in performing the current year goodwill impairment test when both methods are used for a reporting unit we consider the similarities of each valuation to the underlying business to determine the weight given to each method in and we weighted the two methods equally in determining the value of the reporting units that used both methods because we believe both methods have an equal probability of providing an appropriate fair value in fiscal we used both the dcf and the cb method for all five of our reporting units in fiscal we used the dcf method for all reporting units and the cb method for base station subsystems wireless innovations and satellite communications as these represented managements best estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit table of contents when using the cb method we select comparable companies that operate in the same market place as the reporting unit because of the limited number of companies that operate in the same market and are of the same size as the reporting unit we focus on companies that closely match the reporting unit from a product offering and customer base standpoint regardless of size when considering the multiples of the comparable companies we factor in the size of the comparable companies when selecting the appropriate multiple to use in the valuation generally the cb method has resulted in a higher valuation of our reporting units than the dcf method this is indicative of the future prospects and higher values that the market places on companies that operate in our industry although our cash flow forecasts used in the dcf method are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives if actual results are different from our forecasts future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill which could result in non cash charges adversely affecting our results of operations in fiscal we recorded asset impairment charges related to goodwill for two of our reporting units we recorded an impairment charge for base stations subsystems due to an interim test of goodwill and we recorded an impairment of satellite communications goodwill based on our annual impairment test as a result of the losses generated by the base station subsystems reporting unit in the first six months of fiscal in excess of our plan we determined that a potential indicator of impairment had occurred and an interim test for goodwill impairment was required we performed a step one impairment test in accordance with paragraph of sfas on this reporting unit as of march based on the test we determined that a potential indicator of impairment existed and a step two test in accordance with sfas was required in the third quarter of fiscal we completed the step two test of the base station subsystems reporting unit and recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal decreased spending levels from two major customers caused us to reevaluate our projected level of sales earnings and cash flows for the base station subsystems reporting unit this review resulted in a reduction in projected sales operating earnings and cash flows as compared to the july valuation the july valuation included higher sales volumes and a projected sales mix that was more dependent on historically lower margin high volume products the sales and operating earning projections in the march valuation include a more focused rationalization of product lines which had the primary effect of decreasing projected sales levels over the next several years the lower market multiples were based on base station subsystems size and operating results compared to other market participants the assumptions used in the valuation of base station subsystems as of march were also used for the july valuation listed below as a result of the announced plan to sell the satellite communications business in the third quarter of fiscal we determined a potential indicator of impairment had occurred and an interim test of goodwill was required we determined at the time that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment existed in the fourth quarter of fiscal we reevaluated the satellite communications business and determined that as a result of continuing operating losses and lower short term business prospects as compared to previous forecasts and despite significant numbers of initial indications of interest the low number of then remaining substantive bids that had resulted from our effort to sell the satellite communications business the fair value of the satellite communications reporting unit was less than its carrying value and an indicator of impairment existed we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test and recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal reducing the balance of the satellite communications goodwill to zero the following tables summarize the significant assumptions in the dcf fair value calculations revenue growth rate projected as of july valuation date terminal antenna

network solutions for the valuation because these reporting units had continued positive results in fiscal had large amounts of headroom in fiscal and had fiscal projected results that indicated continued revenue and ebit margin growth b for the satellite communications and network solutions valuations the valuation of base station subsystems valuation and the satellite communications and base station subsystems valuations we applied the multiples to projected revenue and ebitda margins from our dcf model instead of historical amounts historical amounts did not accurately reflect changes in the business and the projected amounts were considered a more accurate view of the reporting units long term performance c ebitda was not used for the cb method in as the comparable companies for wireless innovations provided an inconsistent range of multiples the following table illustrates the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of september and and the amount of headroom which represents the percentage difference between each reporting units fair value and carrying value as of our annual impairment test july and as follows goodwill headroom a september july in thousands antenna and cable satellite communications b c base station subsystems network solutions wireless innovations a headroom fair value carrying valuecarrying value b satellite communications goodwill was written off as of september c as a result of the negative headroom we had an indicator of impairment and ultimately recorded an impairment charge for satellite communications goodwill the increase in antenna and cable headroom is due primarily to the use of a lower discount rate and higher long term growth projections the conservative nature of the projections in comparison to the historical operating results of the reporting unit as well as market conditions surrounding the industry in which the antenna and cable reporting unit operates indicated a need to reduce the discount rate satellite communications as discussed above had lower than expected results and thus lower future projections resulting in an impairment of all of the reporting units goodwill the decrease in wireless innovations headroom was the result of lower projected long term operating margins as continued increases in revenue growth were more than offset by increased costs to achieve that growth rate network solutions has continued to produce positive results however because of the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the cash flow projections there is a greater risk of potential future impairment especially if the business is adversely impacted by the resolution of the trueposition intellectual property matter table of contents if one or more of these assumptions differ from our

primarily related to net operating losses and tax credits carried forward to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration we are required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of the deferred tax assets the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant management judgment and is based upon our best estimate of anticipated taxable profits in the various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated changes in expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes valuation allowances have been established for the portion of deferred tax assets representing net us and italian deferred tax assets including book and tax asset basis differences federal and state loss carryforwards and federal and state tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign loss carryforwards and book and tax asset basis differences in jurisdictions where management feels future realization is sufficiently uncertain see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements no valuation allowances have been established for the remaining net deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions as management expects future taxable income based on a recent history of taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities will make the realization of such deferred tax assets more likely than not we currently anticipate that we will be required to earn taxable profits of approximately million in various foreign jurisdictions in order to fully utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets these deferred tax assets are primarily related to book and tax asset basis differences table of contents restructuring at september we had a restructuring reserve of million for restructuring and integration activities these accruals are based on our best estimate of the costs associated with merger integration and restructuring plans including employee termination costs lease cancellations and other costs if actual costs of these activities differ significantly from these estimates results of operations could be impacted defined benefit plans some of our employees are covered by defined benefit plans approximately current and former employees of our united kingdom subsidiary andrew ltd participate in a defined benefit plan the costs and obligations recorded for these plans are dependent upon actuarial assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest costs expected compensation increases benefits earned mortality rates and other factors if actual results are significantly different than those forecasted or if future changes are made to these assumptions the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods the discount rate enables management to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we estimate that a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased benefit expense in fiscal by million a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased benefit expense in fiscal by million to determine the expected return on plan assets management considers the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical returns on plan assets a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on pension plan assets would have decreased or increased pension expense in fiscal by million off balance sheet arrangements as of september we do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements the term off balance sheet arrangement generally is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which we have i made guarantees ii a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets iii any obligation under certain derivative instruments or iv any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to a company or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services within a company table of contents aggregate contractual obligations and commitments as of september expected future cash payments under contractual obligations and commitments and the estimated timeframe in which such obligations are expected to be fulfilled were as follows payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt a operating leases b capital leases b purchase obligations c copper purchases d benefit plan obligations e total a long term debt includes maturities and interest obligations included in the long term debt obligations are million of convertible subordinated notes due fiscal we may not redeem the notes prior to august after which time we may redeem the notes at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any holders may require us to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on august therefore the million convertible notes are classified as current liabilities on the balance sheet refer to note financing in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the use and availability of debt and revolving credit agreements b see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of leases c purchase obligations of million represent purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory as well as other goods and services in the ordinary course of business and exclude balances for purchases currently recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet d in order to reduce our exposure to copper price fluctuations we have entered into contracts with various suppliers to purchase approximately of our forecasted copper requirements for fiscal which represents contracts to purchase million pounds of copper for million e benefit plan obligations of million include estimated future contributions and benefit payments under our defined benefit and post retirement medical and life insurance plans to the extent the plans are not sufficiently funded see note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our benefit plan obligations the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations we believe that our existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commitments and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodities as follows interest rate risk we had million in debt outstanding at september in the form of debt agreements and capital lease obligations at both fixed and variable rates we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our variable rate debt which totaled million or of our total debt a basis point increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we currently do not use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk foreign currency risk our international operations represent a substantial portion of our overall operating results and asset base in many cases our products are produced at manufacturing facilities in foreign countries to support sales in those markets during fiscal sales of products exported from the united states or manufactured abroad were of total sales our identifiable foreign exchange rate exposures result primarily from accounts receivable from customer sales anticipated purchases of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies we primarily manage our foreign currency risk by making use of naturally offsetting positions that include the establishment of local manufacturing facilities that conduct business in local currency we also selectively utilize derivative instruments such as forward exchange contracts to manage the risk of exchange fluctuations these instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes these contracts are not designated as hedges for hedge accounting and are marked to market each period we estimate that a hypothetical increase or decrease in all non us dollar currencies would have decreased or increased respectively reported net loss by approximately million in fiscal commodity risk we use various metals in the production of our products copper which is used to manufacture coaxial cable is the most significant of these metals as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in the price of copper in order to reduce this exposure we have implemented price increases on our coaxial cable products and have entered into forward purchase contracts with various copper suppliers as of september we entered into contracts to purchase approximately of our forecasted copper requirements for fiscal which represents contracts to purchase million pounds of copper for million we estimate that a change in the price of copper could increase or decrease the cost of our forecasted fiscal copper purchases that are not under contract at september by approximately million we also use certain petrochemicals for cable coatings and a change in the price of these petrochemicals would have an estimated million impact on our forecasted cost of products sold in fiscal table of contents
