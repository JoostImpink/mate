item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business we are engaged in providing pressure pumping services and other oilfield services to the oil and natural gas industry worldwide services are provided through four business segments usmexico pressure pumping canada pressure pumping international pressure pumping and the oilfield services group the usmexico canada and international pressure pumping segments provide stimulation and cementing services to the petroleum industry throughout the world stimulation services are designed to improve the flow of oil and natural gas from producing formations cementing services consists of pumping a cement slurry into a well between the casing and the wellbore to isolate fluids that might otherwise damage the casing and or affect productivity or that could migrate to different zones primarily during the drilling and completion phases of a well see business included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more information on these operations the oilfield services group consists of casing and tubular services process and pipeline services chemical services completion tools and completion fluids services in the united states and in select markets internationally baker hughes merger agreement on august we and baker hughes incorporated baker hughes entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement pursuant to which we will merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of baker hughes and each share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of baker hughes common stock and in cash the merger completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions including i approval of the merger by our stockholders ii approval by the stockholders of baker hughes of the issuance of baker hughes common stock to execute the merger iii applicable regulatory approvals including the termination or expiration of the applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of as amended iv the effectiveness of a registration statement on form s relating to the baker hughes common stock to be issued in the merger and v other customary closing conditions under the merger agreement we agreed to conduct our business in the ordinary course while the merger is pending and to generally refrain from acquiring new businesses incurring new indebtedness repurchasing treasury shares issuing new common stock or equity awards or entering into new material contracts or commitments outside the normal course of business without the consent of baker hughes under certain circumstances we or baker hughes may be required to pay a termination fee of million to the other party if the merger is not completed when and if the merger is approved or completed certain contractual obligations of the company will or may be triggered or accelerated under the change of control provisions of such contractual arrangements examples of such arrangements include stock based compensation awards severance and retirement plan agreements applicable to executive officers directors and certain employees and the equipment partnership described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements we and baker hughes are working to comply with the department of justices second request for additional information and documentary material issued october and to complete the merger as quickly as practicable and we currently expect the merger to be completed during our second fiscal quarter of fiscal however we cannot predict with certainty when the merger will be completed because completion of the merger is subject to conditions both within and beyond our control market conditions our worldwide operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled the depth and drilling conditions of such wells the number of well completions and the level of workover activity drilling and workover activity in turn is largely dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas and the volatility and expectations of future oil and natural gas prices our results of operations also depend heavily on the pricing we receive from our customers which depends on activity levels availability of equipment and other resources and competitive pressures these market factors often lead to volatility in our revenue and profitability especially in the united states and canada where we have historically generated in excess of of our revenue table of contents historical market conditions are reflected in the table below for our fiscal years ended september change change rig count us canada international commodity prices average crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes inc rig count information excludes canada and includes mexico rig count of and for the fiscal years ended september and respectively us rig count demand for our pressure pumping services in the united states is primarily driven by oil and natural gas drilling activity which tends to be extremely volatile depending on the current and anticipated prices of crude oil and natural gas during the last years the lowest annual us rig count averaged in fiscal and the highest annual us rig count averaged in fiscal with the retraction of oil and natural gas prices since their peak in july tightening and uncertainty in the credit markets and the global economic slowdown drilling activity in the united states has rapidly declined from peak levels of rigs at september to a recent low of rigs at june before gradually improving during our fiscal fourth quarter us rig count was rigs at october the near term and longer range outlook for us drilling activity is uncertain and will ultimately be influenced by a number of factors including commodity prices global demand for oil and natural gas production and depletion rates of oil and natural gas reserves and government policy with respect to the financial credit crisis energy and environmental issues and other issues impacting our business canadian rig count the demand for our pressure pumping services in canada is primarily driven by oil and natural gas drilling activity and similar to the united states tends to be extremely volatile during the last years the lowest annual rig count averaged in fiscal and the highest annual rig count averaged in fiscal similar to activity in the united states drilling rig activity in canada has declined significantly since late september rig count in canada typically encounters significant seasonal fluctuations decreasing during the spring break up period when snow and ice begin to melt and heavy equipment is not permitted on the roads restricting access to well sites and therefore resulting in lower drilling activity the spring break up period typically begins in late february or march and extends through may drilling activity in canada was generally slow to resume after spring break up in fiscal due to adverse market conditions at october the canadian drilling rig count was rigs international rig count many countries in which we operate are subject to political social and economic risks which may cause volatility within any given country however our international revenue in total is less volatile because we operate in approximately countries which helps to offset exposure to any one country due to the significant investment and complexity of international projects we believe drilling decisions relating to such projects tend to be evaluated and monitored with a longer term perspective with regard to oil and natural gas pricing additionally the international market is dominated by major oil companies and national oil companies which tend to have different objectives and more operating stability than the typical independent producer in north america during the last years the lowest annual international rig count excluding canada and including mexico averaged in fiscal and the highest annual international rig count averaged in fiscal international rig count declined during fiscal compared to fiscal but at a much lower rate than north america in response to prevailing market conditions we have implemented a number of cost reduction measures in the united states canada and certain markets outside of north america such measures include reducing personnel levels managing our supply chain to reduce material costs reducing capital spending and controlling our investment in working capital table of contents results of operations consolidated dollars in millions change change revenue operating income operating income margin worldwide rig count estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes inc rig count information results for fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal the impact of the global economic downturn and decreased demand for oil and natural gas combined with intense price competition in north america negatively affected each of our reporting segments compared to the prior year consolidated revenue for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal and consolidated operating income decreased primarily as a result of decreased demand and intense price competition for our products and services most notably in the united states and canada results for fiscal included unusual charges including a non cash charge of million related to the settlement of a us defined benefit pension plan employee severance costs of million million in non cash charges related to excess or idle fixed assets million of non cash inventory write downs and million of costs related to the pending merger with baker hughes these unusual charges during fiscal represented of consolidated revenue for fiscal consolidated operating income margin decreased to from in fiscal results for fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal with all of our reportable segments showing sequential revenue growth revenue from usmexico pressure pumping services increased from fiscal as a result of higher activity levels largely offset by lower pricing for our products and services revenue from our canada and international pressure pumping services increased and respectively the canadian increase was primarily attributable to favorable exchange rates and the international increase was the result of increased activity in the middle east asia pacific and latin america during our oilfield services groups revenue increased largely as a result of increased international activity and to a lesser extent the acquisition of innicor subsurface technologies inc in may despite improved revenue from all of our reportable segments consolidated operating income margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal declining prices for our products and services in the north american market as well as increased material and fuel costs led to the overall decline in operating income margin see discussion below on individual reporting

decrease was primarily the result of lower pricing and decreased demand for our products and services within the us market partially offset by increased activity in mexico usmexico pressure pumping operating income margin decreased from in fiscal to for fiscal as increased competition in the united states resulted in lower pricing for our products and services the results for fiscal also include

showed improved revenue from fiscal while us activity increased for fiscal compared to fiscal the prices we received for our products and services declined usmexico pressure pumping operating income margin decreased from in fiscal to for fiscal a decline in prices coupled with increased material maintenance and fuel costs caused the fiscal operating income margin decline canada pressure pumping

hughes inc rig count information results for fiscal compared to fiscal canadian pressure pumping revenue decreased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal average drilling rig count in canada was down for the comparable periods the weaker canadian dollar compared to the us dollar during the comparable periods accounts for approximately million of the revenue decrease in addition decreased demand and lower pricing during the second half of fiscal negatively impacted revenue for the comparable periods relative to the us dollar the average canadian dollar exchange rate decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal thereby decreasing the us dollar equivalent of revenues earned in canada operating income margin for fiscal declined to compared to for fiscal decreased drilling activity and increased pricing pressures in fiscal contributed to the operating margin decline results for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenue for canada pressure pumping for fiscal was almost entirely due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar the average canadian dollar exchange rate increased in fiscal compared to fiscal thereby increasing the us dollar equivalent of revenues earned in canada activity levels had little impact on the revenue increase as the canadian average active drilling rigs for fiscal remained unchanged from the prior year operating income margin for fiscal was consistent with fiscal despite improved revenues the region operating income margin was negatively impacted by increased pricing pressures and cost increases in fiscal table of contents international pressure pumping segment dollars in millions change change revenue operating income operating income margin international rig count estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes inc rig count information excluding canada and mexico our international pressure pumping segment has four operating segments our europe segment includes the north sea continental europe nigeria and the west africa coastal area north of nigeria our middle east segment includes the arab countries india central asia and north africa including algeria libya and egypt our latin america segment includes south america central america and west africa countries south of nigeria including angola and gabon we completed our contractual obligations and shut down our pressure pumping operation in russia during fiscal consequently our russia pressure pumping operations are now classified as discontinued operations results for fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes the percentage change in revenue for each of the operating segments within the international pressure pumping reportable segment comparing fiscal to fiscal change inrevenue europe middle east asia pacific latin america international pressure pumping revenue of billion in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal consistent with the decline in average international drilling rig activity the increased revenue in asia pacific is largely attributable to increased activity in malaysia and thailand offset by lower activity in china and new zealand the decline in latin america revenue was largely the result of industry wide labor strikes in argentina during much of the second half of fiscal partially offset by activity related increases in brazil in the middle east the favorable impact of increased activity and new service contracts in north africa was more than offset by lower rig activity in saudi arabia india and kazakhstan revenues in europe decreased in fiscal largely as a result of unfavorable exchange rates primarily in early fiscal which caused local currency billings to translate into fewer us dollars combined with lower activity and lower pricing in the north sea operating income margin from our international pressure pumping operations decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily as a result of lower volume of activity and lower pricing in certain countries within the middle east and latin america regions fiscal results in the international pressure pumping segment included severance costs totaling million associated with our initiative to align our workforce with current market conditions a million charge related to a denied value added tax refund claim in the asia pacific charges of million for unfavorable outcomes of a tax court ruling and a customer dispute and million of fixed asset impairment charges results for fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes the percentage change in revenue for each of the operating segments within the international pressure pumping reportable segment comparing fiscal to fiscal change inrevenue europe middle east asia pacific latin america table of contents international pressure pumping revenue increased for fiscal compared to fiscal increased activity in our middle east and latin american operations primarily accounted for the overall revenue increase our middle east operations benefited from the introduction of two stimulation vessels into the india market as well as improved revenues from algeria and activity increases in saudi arabia kazakhstan and azerbaijan our latin american operations experienced significant growth in brazil argentina venezuela and in gabon when comparing fiscal revenue to fiscal primarily as a result of increased drilling and completion activity in those countries average active drilling rigs in the region increased when compared to the prior year in asia pacific revenue increased with average active drilling rigs in the region increasing most major markets within the region experienced revenue growth declines in revenue from our offshore stimulation vessel in the north sea due to its relocation to india as well as a revenue decline from our northern west africa operations caused the decrease in revenue for europe for fiscal compared to fiscal operating income margin remained consistent with fiscal at with declines in revenue from our asia pacific operations offsetting positive contribution to operating income from our other operating regions oilfield services group

operating segments within the oilfield services group comparing fiscal to fiscal change inrevenue tubular services process pipeline services chemical services completion tools completion fluids revenues from our oilfield services group decreased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal while worldwide average drilling rig count declined tubular services declined primarily as a result of lower service activity in the us gulf of mexico and asia pacific process pipeline services revenue declined as a result of decreased activity in north america and the conclusion of several large international projects in fiscal chemical services revenue declined at a lower rate than other oilfield services businesses as increased capillary work in the united states and internationally substantially offset the revenue impact of lower drilling and completion activity in north america completion tools revenue declined as a result of lower activity in the us gulf of mexico and lower international sales the impact of which was somewhat offset by the inclusion of a full year contribution from the innicor subsurface technologies business which was acquired in may completion fluids revenue decreased primarily as a result of lower activity in the us gulf of mexico partially offset by new contract work in mexico operating income margin for the oilfield services group in fiscal declined to from in the prior year primarily as a result of lower activity and to a lesser extent lower pricing and an unfavorable productservice mix table of contents results for fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes the percentage change in revenue for each of the operating segments within the oilfield services group comparing fiscal to fiscal change inrevenue tubular services process pipeline services chemical services completion tools completion fluids all of the operating segments within our oilfield services group except completion fluids which was negatively impacted by a decline in offshore deepwater activity in the gulf of mexico showed improved revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal process pipeline services benefited from increased international and us activity while chemical services benefited primarily from increased revenue from capillary services and increased us activity levels in may we acquired innicor subsurface technologies inc this acquisition along with increased project oriented sales in international markets accounted for our completion tools revenue improvement excluding the effect of the innicor acquisition completion tools revenue improved tubular services also showed improved revenue as a result of increased activity in international markets operating income margin for the oilfield services group in fiscal declined to from in fiscal positive contributions from our process pipeline services chemical services and tubular services groups were offset by declining operating income margins from our completion tools and completion fluids operating segments within the oilfield services group other operating expenses the following table sets forth our other operating expenses dollars in millions ofrevenue ofrevenue ofrevenue research and engineering marketing general and administrative loss on disposal of assets net pension settlement research and engineering research and engineering expense decreased million or

a percentage of revenue fiscal marketing expense increased slightly to compared to in fiscal table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expense remained flat at million in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting the impact of cost reduction measures introduced in offset by costs related to the pending baker hughes merger increased stock based compensation expense and other expenses incurred in we incurred million of costs related to the merger in our corporate segment in fiscal primarily including investment banking fees and outside legal fees associated with the merger agreement the regulatory approval process and the stockholder litigation discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense was in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily as a result of the lower revenue base in fiscal in fiscal general and administrative expense increased million or compared to fiscal primarily as a result of increased personnel costs and depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense was in fiscal consistent with fiscal loss on disposal of assets net loss on disposal of assets net of gains increased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of non cash fixed asset impairment charges totaling million recorded in the third quarter of these charges related to certain cementing and stimulation equipment that was not economical to repair or maintain in the current market environment pension settlement in september we entered into an agreement with an insurance company to settle our obligation with respect to the us defined benefit pension plan plan assets of approximately million were used to purchase an insurance contract to fund the benefits and settle the plan in december we received approval from the pension benefit guaranty corporation and the internal revenue service and were relieved of primary responsibility for the pension benefit obligation consequently we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million in connection with the settlement in the first quarter of fiscal in our corporate segment interest expense and interest income the following table shows a comparison of interest expense and interest income in millions interest expense interest income net interest expense interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases in interest expense are primarily attributable to lower average outstanding borrowings when comparing the respective periods outstanding debt balances decreased from million at september to million at september and to million at september interest income decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of lower prevailing interest rates in invested cash balances despite significantly higher average cash and cash equivalents balance throughout fiscal fiscal interest income increased slightly compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher average invested cash balances other expense net other expense net of other income for the fiscal years ended september is summarized as follows in millions minority interest non operating net foreign exchange gain loss loss gain from sale of equity method investments legal settlements other net other expense net the increase in other expense net for fiscal compared to fiscal relates to increased minority interest as a result of improved operating results from our international joint venture operations partially offset by a fiscal loss on the sale of our hungarian joint venture not repeating in fiscal in fiscal we recorded a million loss on the sale of our interest in a hungarian joint venture operation and we received a million cash settlement in a litigation matter for additional information see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements table of contents income tax expense primarily as a result of lower profit in our north american operations and the resulting change in the geographic mix of our pre tax income in fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to of pre tax income from continuing operations in fiscal compared to in fiscal we earned profits in relatively low tax jurisdictions outside of north america and recorded significant pre tax losses in the relatively high tax jurisdictions of the united states and canada the us losses can be carried back to offset taxes paid in previous years our effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the effect of a statutory tax rate decrease in canada a greater percentage of income earned in international tax jurisdictions and an increase in the domestic production activity deduction section of the us internal revenue code in fiscal discontinued operations we completed work on our final pressure pumping contract in russia in july consequently we classified the russia pressure pumping unit an operating segment within the international pumping services segment as a discontinued operation accordingly the assets and liabilities of this business along with its historical results of operations have been reclassified for all periods presented as soon as our contractual obligations were fulfilled we began the process of redeployment and liquidation of the assets associated with this business and other exit activities we recorded charges totaling million in connection with these exit activities including employee separation costs fixed asset and inventory impairment charges we expect to incur additional exit costs during fiscal in the range of million as we complete the exit activities associated with our russia pressure pumping business summarized operating results from discontinued operations are as follows year ended september in millions revenue loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the completion of our contractual service obligations and subsequent exit activities related to our russia pressure pumping operations fiscal results included million of inventory impairment million of fixed asset impairment and million of employee termination costs fiscal included a million goodwill impairment charge related to our russia pressure pumping operations we recognized this goodwill impairment charge when our analysis indicated that all goodwill associated with that business would not likely be recoverable as a result of competitive pressure in the areas in which we operate cost inflation currency risks and concerns over future activity reductions income tax expense related to discontinued operations was minimal for the three year period ending september due to accumulated operating losses in russia for which no benefit was realizable table of contents liquidity and capital resources historical cash flow the following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the years ended september in millions cash provided by operations cash used in investing cash used in financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash change in cash and cash equivalents fiscal cash flow from operating activities of million in fiscal decreased million or compared to the million of cash provided from operations in fiscal net income from continuing operations of million in fiscal was million lower than in fiscal and million lower than fiscal primarily as a result of the market downturn and corresponding lower demand for our services and products non cash items included in net income primarily including depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense pension settlement net loss on disposal or impairment of assets bad debt reserves and deferred income taxes totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal changes in working capital and other operating accounts generated cash of million in fiscal compared to using cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal primarily as a result of the decline in market activity which led to reductions in working capital cash used in investing decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting a decrease in capital expenditures primarily as a result of lower expansion capital needed due to lower demand for our products and services cash used in financing activities decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher debt repayments during fiscal compared to fiscal partially offset by a treasury stock purchase of million in fiscal in addition to the treasury stock purchase financing activities in fiscal primarily consisted of million net in payments of short term borrowings and million in dividend payments we also received net proceeds in the amount of million from employee stock purchases and stock option exercises during fiscal fiscal cash flow from operations of million in fiscal increased million or compared to the million of cash provided from operations in fiscal primarily as a result of lower investment in inventories between the two periods net cash flows before changes in operating accounts were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal with the decrease primarily attributable to lower usmexico pressure pumping operating income changes in operating accounts accounted for million of cash usage in fiscal compared to million usage in fiscal this improvement was primarily attributable to the stable inventory levels compared to significant increases in inventory in fiscal increased receivables accounted for a million use of cash primarily as a result of increased revenues particularly internationally the cash flow used in investing during the fiscal was almost entirely due to million of purchases of property plant and equipment and million for the acquisition of businesses principally innicor subsurface technologies inc in may cash flows used in financing consisted of million net in payments of short term borrowings and million in dividend payments during fiscal we also received net proceeds in the amount of million from employee stock purchases and stock option exercises during fiscal further investing activities during the period included the issuance of senior notes due for million in net proceeds in may and the repayment of million of senior notes in june table of contents fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal was million significant uses of cash in fiscal included increased inventory in anticipation of increases in activity increased accounts receivable as a result of increased revenue and days sales outstanding and increased prepaid expenses primarily related to tax payments increased accounts payable also contributed to cash flow from operations mostly from increased activity levels the cash flow used in investing during fiscal was almost entirely due to million of purchases of property plant and equipment including million paid to buy out an equipment partnership established in we also paid million net of cash for acquisitions cash flows used in financing consisted of million net in proceeds from short term borrowings million in repurchases of our common stock and million of dividend payments during fiscal we also received proceeds in the amount of million from employee stock purchases and stock option exercises during fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance of million at september and cash flows from operations are expected to be our primary source of liquidity in fiscal our sources of liquidity also include the available financing facilities listed below in millions financing facility expiration borrowings atseptember available atseptember revolving credit facility august discretionary various times within the next months on may we completed a public offering of million of senior notes due the net proceeds from the offering of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses were used to retire million in outstanding floating rate senior notes which matured june as of september the company had million of the senior notes due and million of the senior notes due issued and outstanding net of discount our amended and restated revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to million in principal amount the revolving credit facility includes a million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a million sublimit for swingline loans swingline loans have short term maturities and the remaining amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility become due and payable in august in addition we have the right to request up to an additional million over the permitted borrowings of million subject to the approval of our lenders at the time of the request depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding under this facility the interest rate applicable to borrowings generally ranges from basis points above libor we are charged various fees in connection with the revolving credit facility including a commitment fee based on the average daily unused portion of the commitment totaling million million and million in fiscal and respectively in addition the revolving credit facility charges a utilization fee on all outstanding loans and letters of credit when usage of the revolving credit facility exceeds there were no material utilization fees incurred in fiscal or there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility at september or and pursuant to the merger agreement their must be no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility on the completion date of the merger in may we entered into a committed credit facility with a commercial bank to finance our acquisition of innicor subsurface technologies inc there were no commitment fees required by this facility and the interest rate was based on market rates on the dates that amounts are borrowed this facility expired in may and was repaid with cash on hand in addition to the revolving credit facility we had available million of unsecured discretionary lines of credit at september which expire at the banks discretion there are no requirements for commitment fees or compensating balances in connection with these lines of credit and interest is at prevailing market rates there was million million and million in outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at september and respectively the weighted average interest rates on short term borrowings outstanding as of september and were and respectively table of contents management believes that cash flows from operations combined with cash and cash equivalents the revolving credit facility and other discretionary credit facilities provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our routine operations meet debt service obligations fund projected capital expenditures pay a regular quarterly dividend and support the development of our short term and long term operating strategies if the discretionary lines of credit are not renewed or if borrowings under these lines of credit otherwise become unavailable we expect to refinance this debt by arranging additional committed bank facilities or through other long term borrowing alternatives the senior notes and the revolving credit facility include various customary covenants and other provisions including the maintenance of certain profitability and solvency ratios none of which materially restrict our activities we are currently in compliance with all covenants imposed cash requirements we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the actual amount of fiscal capital expenditures will depend primarily on maintenance capital requirements expansion opportunities and our ability to execute our budgeted capital expenditures in fiscal our minimum pension and postretirement funding requirements are anticipated to be approximately million we funded million to our pension and postretirement plans during fiscal we paid cash dividends in the amount of per common share on a quarterly basis in fiscal totaling million we anticipate paying a quarterly dividend in fiscal until the merger is completed however dividends are subject to approval of our board of directors each quarter and the board has the ability to change the dividend policy at any time as of september the company had million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due issued and outstanding net of discount we expect cash paid for interest expense to be approximately million in fiscal contractual obligations and off balance sheet transactions the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of september in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term and short term debt interest on long term debt and capital leases capital lease obligations operating leases equipment financing arrangement purchase obligations purchase commitments other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations as discussed below we have notified the partner of our intent to exercise our option to purchase the pumping service equipment in this partnership for approximately million in we have therefore included the option payment in the table above includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have been approved and that specify all significant terms pricing quantity and timing we have entered into agreements with certain suppliers to ensure that certain levels of fracturing materials are maintained in the united states and canada includes expected cash payments for long term liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheet where the amounts and timing of the payment are known amounts include asset retirement obligations known pension funding requirements post retirement benefit obligation environmental accruals and other miscellaneous long term obligations amounts exclude pension obligations in which funding requirements are uncertain and long term contingent liabilities table of contents on october we adopted the guidance under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc income taxes addressing the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements however the timing of future cash flows associated with asc is uncertain and we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore we excluded million of unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table we expect that cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash flows to fund all of the cash requirements described above in we contributed certain pumping service equipment to a limited partnership in which we own a interest the equipment is used to provide services to our customers for which we pay a service fee over a period of at least six years but not more than years at approximately million annually this is accounted for as an operating lease we assessed the terms of this agreement and determined it was a variable interest entity however we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidation was not required the transaction resulted in a gain that is being deferred and amortized over the partnership term the partnership agreement permits substitution of equipment within the partnership as long as the implied fair value of the new property transferred in at the date of substitution equals or exceeds the implied fair value as defined of the current property in the partnership that is being replaced substitution activity during the partnership term has reduced the balance of the deferred gain to zero at september compared to million at september in we have the option to purchase the pumping service equipment for approximately million and we have notified the partner of our intent to do so we routinely issue parent company guarantees pcgs in connection with service contracts or performance obligations entered into by our subsidiaries the issuance of these pcgs is frequently a condition of the bidding process imposed by our customers for work in countries outside of north america the pcgs typically provide that we guarantee the performance of the services by our local subsidiary the term of these pcgs varies with the length of the service contract to date the parent company has not been called upon to perform under any of these pcgs we arrange for the issuance of a variety of bank guarantees performance bonds and standby letters of credit the vast majority of these are issued in connection with contracts we or our subsidiaries have entered into with customers the customer has the right to call on the bank guarantee performance bond or standby letter of credit in the event that we or our subsidiaries default in the performance of services these instruments are required as a condition to being awarded the contract and are typically released upon completion of the contract we have also issued standby letters of credit in connection with a variety of our financial obligations such as in support of fronted insurance programs claims administration funding certain employee benefit plans and temporary importation bonds the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of september in millions other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period totalamountscommitted less than year years years over years standby letters of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments investigations regarding misappropriation and possible illegal payments we have had discussions with the doj and the sec regarding our internal investigation and certain other matters described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements it is not possible to accurately predict at this time when any of these matters will be resolved based on current information we cannot predict the outcome of such investigations whether we will reach resolution through such discussions or what if any actions may be taken by the doj the sec or other authorities or the effect the foregoing may have on our consolidated financial statements table of contents critical accounting policies for an accounting policy to be deemed critical the accounting policy must i have a potentially material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations and ii require us to make estimates based on historical experience or assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known including estimates not deemed critical we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies the selection of accounting estimates including those deemed critical and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the disclosures elsewhere in the notes to consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other asc requires goodwill to be reviewed for possible impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist specifically goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its net book value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net book value no impairment is required and the second step is unnecessary if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value the second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment if any fair value measures include quoted market price present value technique estimate of future cash flows and a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings or revenue the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount equal to that excess the implied fair value is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination that is the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit determining fair value and the implied fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge our estimate of fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flows this approach uses significant assumptions such as a discount rate growth rate terminal value multiples and future rig count and pricing trends during fiscal we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our russia operations with the competitive pressure in the areas in which we operate in russia cost inflation currency risks and concerns over future activity reductions our analysis indicated that our goodwill associated with russia would not likely be recoverable during fiscal we reviewed our goodwill balance for possible impairment and determined that no impairment existed see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill pension and postretirement benefit plans pension expense and postretirement benefit obligation are determined in accordance with the provisions of asc compensation retirement benefits we determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis in determining the annual estimate of net periodic pension cost we are required to make an evaluation of critical assumptions such as discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets and expected increase in compensation levels these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions discount rates are based on high quality corporate fixed income investments a basis point decrease in the discount rate we used in fiscal would have resulted in the recognition of approximately million in additional expense long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation and average annual returns being earned by similar investments a basis point reduction in the expected rate of return on assets of our plans would have resulted in the recognition of approximately million in additional expense in fiscal table of contents the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon our historical salary experience the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense in future periods our postretirement medical benefit plan provides credits based on years of service that can be used to purchase coverage under the retiree plan this plan effectively caps our health care inflation rate at a increase per year increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point would not have a material impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the net periodic postretirement benefit cost because these benefits are capped pursuant to the terms of the plan in accordance with asc any changes in our assumptions or differences between estimated and actual return on plan assets and compensation levels result in unrecognized gainloss which is recorded as a component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income amounts recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension expense in future periods in fiscal we will have a pension and postretirement funding requirement of approximately million we expect to fund this amount with cash flows from operating activities see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension plans income taxes the effective income tax rates applicable to continuing operations were and for the years ended september and respectively these rates vary primarily due to fluctuations in taxes from the mix of domestic versus foreign income deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company in providing for deferred taxes we consider current tax laws estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies this process also involves making forecasts of current and future years us taxable income unforeseen events and industry conditions may impact these forecasts which in turn can affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and impact our future reported earnings our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty accordingly we provide taxes only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings in addition to the aforementioned assessments that have been received from various taxing authorities we provide for taxes in certain situations where assessments have not been received in those situations we accrue income taxes where we consider it probable that the taxes ultimately payable will exceed those amounts reflected in filed tax returns accordingly taxes are provided in those situations under the guidance in asc self insurance accruals and loss contingencies we are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation general liability property damage and employee medical benefits for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported we review the liability on a quarterly basis the liability is based primarily on an actuarial undiscounted basis using individual case based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience however the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for five years or longer this estimate is subject to trends such as loss development factors historical average claim volume average cost for settled claims and current trends in claim costs significant and unanticipated changes in these trends or future actual payouts could result in additional increases or decreases to the recorded accruals we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit to the extent feasible our aggregate exposure to certain claims there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against the company it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and litigation is subject to many uncertainties it is possible that there could be adverse developments in these cases we record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss our results of operations may be positively or negatively impacted table of contents accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued guidance contained in asc generally accepted accounting principles establishing an authoritative united states gaap superseding all pre existing accounting standards and literature this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods after september consequently we have changed the accounting literature references contained in this report but other than that this new standard had no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements in june the fasb issued asc consolidation variable interest entities which addresses the addition of qualified special purpose entities into previous guidance as the concept of these entities was eliminated by guidance under asc this guidance also modifies the analysis by which a controlling interest of a variable interest entity is determined thereby requiring the controlling interest to consolidate the variable interest entity a controlling interest exists if a party to a variable interest entity has both i the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant to the variable interest entity this statement could impact the way we account for our limited partnership discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under lease and other long term commitments asc becomes effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after november and should be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods during that period going forward we will adopt the guidance under asc on october and have not yet determined the impact if any on our consolidated financial statements in june the fasb issued guidance under asc transfers and servicing which eliminates the concept of a qualified special purpose entity and enhances guidance related to derecognition of transferred assets asc becomes effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after november and should be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods during that period going forward we will adopt the guidance under asc on october and have not yet determined the impact if any on our consolidated financial statements on june we adopted guidance under asc financial instruments overall requiring publicly traded companies to disclose the fair value of financial instruments in their interim financial statements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for such disclosure in may the fasb issued guidance in asc subsequent events to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued we adopted this guidance beginning with our june condensed consolidated financial statements in december the fasb issued guidance under asc compensation retirement benefits defined benefit plans requiring the disclosure of major categories of plan assets investment policies and strategies fair value measurement of plan assets and significant concentration of credit risks related to defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans this guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after december and accordingly we will adopt it in fiscal in april the fasb issued guidance contained in asc intangibles goodwill and others general intangibles other than goodwill amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under previously existing literature the objective of this guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under asc and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under asc business combinations asc is effective for the company beginning october and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements in march the fasb issued guidance under asc derivatives and hedging changing the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under asc and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position financial performance and cash flows we adopted this guidance in the second quarter of fiscal we currently have no derivative financial instruments subject to accounting or disclosure under asc therefore the guidance under asc had no effect on our consolidated statements of financial position results of operations or cash flows table of contents in december the fasb issued guidance under asc business combinations that retains fundamental requirements requiring the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination asc defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control asc establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer a recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree b recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase c determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination this guidance is effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after december consequently we will adopt this guidance on october in december the fasb issued guidance under asc consolidation overall transition amending previous guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary asc requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest it also requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statement of income of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest and requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated asc requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary and shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which initially applied except for the presentation and disclosure requirements the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december our fiscal year beginning october we do not have significant noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries and therefore adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements in february the fasb issued guidance under asc financial instruments providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value under asc companies that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date in addition the guidance establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities the fair value option election is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs asc is effective the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after november and is to be applied prospectively unless the entity elects early adoption consequently we adopted asc effective october and elected not to apply the fair value option in september the fasb issued guidance under asc fair value measurements and disclosures defining fair value outlining a fair value hierarchy requiring market based assumptions be used if available and setting disclosure requirements of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy on october we adopted without material impact on our consolidated financial statements the provisions of asc related to financial assets and liabilities we will adopt the provisions of asc related to non financial assets and liabilities on october and we do not expect the adoption of these provisions to materially impact our consolidated financial statements forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act of concerning among other things our prospects expected revenue expenses and profits developments and business strategies for our operations all of which are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions these forward looking statements include all statements other than historical fact including those identified as outlook and by their use of terms and phrases such as expect estimate project forecast believe achievable anticipate should and similar terms and phrases that convey the uncertainty of future events and outcomes these statements are based on certain table of contents assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends current conditions expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances but that may not prove to be accurate such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to general economic and business conditions global economic activity oil and natural gas market conditions political and economic uncertainty and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report including under item a risk factors if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary materially from those expected estimated or projected forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and other than as required under securities laws we do not assume a duty to update or revise these forward looking statements item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement our major market risk exposure is to foreign currency fluctuations internationally and changing interest rates primarily in the united states canada and europe our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt if the floating rates were to increase by from september our combined interest expense to third parties would increase by a total of thousand each month in which such increase continued at september and we had fixed rate debt outstanding of million and million net of discount respectively these instruments are fixed rate and therefore do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates however the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their rates at september periodically we borrow funds which are denominated in foreign currencies which exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements there were million and million borrowings denominated in foreign currencies at september and respectively when management believes prudent we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations there were no such forward foreign exchange contracts at september or the expected maturity dates and fair value of our market risk sensitive instruments are stated below in millions of us dollars expected maturity dates fair value thereafter total short term borrowings bank borrowings denominated in foreign currencies average rate long term borrowings senior notes due senior notes due total table of contents
