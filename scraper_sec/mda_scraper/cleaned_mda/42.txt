advertisements in newspapers including freestanding inserts fsis magazine advertisements and the internet the graphics process is generally the same regardless of the application the following steps in the graphics process must take place to produce a final image strategic analysis planning and messaging conceptual design content creation file building retouching art production pre media the companys involvement with a clients project may involve all of the above steps or just one of the steps depending on the clients needs each client assignment or job is a custom job in that the image being produced is unique even if it only involves a small change from an existing image such as adding a low fat banner on a food package essentially such changes equal new revenue for the company the company is paid for its graphic imaging work regardless of the success or failure of the food product the promotion or the ad campaign historically a substantial majority of the companys revenues have been derived from providing graphic services for consumer product packaging applications packaging changes occur with regular frequency and lack of advance notice and client turn around requirements

halloween thanksgiving and christmas in addition there are event driven promotions that occur regularly such as the super bowl grammy awards world series indianapolis and the olympics changing regulatory requirements also necessitate new packaging from time to time as do the number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging such as heart healthy low in carbohydrates enriched with essential vitamins low in saturated fat and caffeine free all of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs in each case creating

employees labor the company expects to fund future contractual obligations through funds generated from operations together with general company financing transactions critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the company believes that the following are the most critical accounting estimates that could have an effect on its reported results table of contents accounts receivable the companys clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers retailers and life science companies accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to the company from its normal business activities the companys allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using assumptions of minimum reserve requirement percentages applied to the aging of the companys trade accounts receivable along with specific reserves for known collection issues for example the aging based portion of the companys reserve is determined by applying a percent reserve to amounts overdue by more than days a percent reserve to amounts overdue by more than days and a percent reserve for amounts overdue by more than days in the companys experience this policy as supplemented by specific reserves for known collection issues broadly captures the credit risk in its receivables based on the companys estimates and assumptions an allowance for doubtful accounts of million was recorded at december compared to an allowance of million at december a change in the companys assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value any difference could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the consumer packaging industry a loss of a major customer or several customers a significant decrease in the market value of an asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is used or an adverse change in the physical condition of an asset the company tests long lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances have changed and a potential impairment trigger is indicated impairment is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if this comparison indicates that an asset is impaired the loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the companys impairment losses in regard to long lived assets have in recent years primarily related to surplus properties resulting from restructuring ie facility consolidation actions and customer relationship intangible assets for significant losses the company estimates fair value based on market valuation studies performed by qualified third party valuation experts assumptions used in estimating cash flows include among other things those assumptions concerning periods of operation and projections of revenues and costs of revenues industry trends and market interest rates there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates used in assessing asset impairment and it is possible that impairment charges recognized in a given period would differ if the assessment was made in a different period during the company recorded million for impairment of long lived assets related to customer relationship intangible assets at company locations where projected cash flows did not support the carrying value of the assets the expense is reflected as an impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss at december a change in the companys business climate in future periods including a significant downturn in the companys operations could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the companys long lived assets resulting in future additional impairment charges goodwill and other acquired intangible assets the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill customer relationships and to a lesser extent other intangible assets goodwill is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value other intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances have changed and a potential impairment trigger is indicated events that may indicate potential impairment include a loss of or a significant decrease in volume from a major customer a change in the expected useful life of an asset a change in the market value of an asset a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate unanticipated competition relative to a major customer or the loss of key personnel relative to a major customer impairment is evaluated in a recoverability test including a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if this comparison indicates that an acquired intangible asset is impaired the loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company performs its annual impairment test as of october each year the company performed its and goodwill impairment tests as of october and respectively and determined that no impairment of goodwill was indicated for either year for both years the company performed its annual impairment review on a geographic basis at the operating segment level the company has determined that its operating segments are also its reporting units for goodwill testing using projection of operating cash flow for each reporting unit the company performed a step one assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach ie discounted cash flow or dcf as compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit in addition the company utilized a market approach which assumes that companies operating in the same industry will share similar characteristics and the company values will correlate to those characteristics to validate the results of the income approach valuations however due to lack of comparable industry data the company ultimately relied on the income approach in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units the dcf method was used due to company specific growth and profitability factors best captured in managements projections which are considered most representative of the future outlook for the reporting units table of contents the step one impairment analysis for the october test indicated no potential impairment of the assigned goodwill the following table summarizes the results of the companys step one impairment analysis as of october in millions americas europe asia pacific total fair value of reporting unit carrying value of reporting unit percentage fair value over carrying value goodwill allocated to reporting unit based on the october closing price of the companys common stock the company had a market capitalization of million compared to its estimated fair value of million which indicates an implied control premium of approximately percent the discounted cash flow model used for the income valuation approach was based on the companys ten year projections of operating income for each reporting unit the companys ten year projection assumes revenue growth of to percent annually with a commensurate increase in operating expenses the discount rates used for the cash flow model varied from percent to percent by reporting unit in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units in making this assessment the companys management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results business plans and present value techniques there are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows and managements judgment is required in applying these assumptions and estimates to the analysis of goodwill impairment including projecting revenues and profits interest rates cost of capital tax rates the corporations stock price and the allocation of shared or corporate items many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change from period to period these changes may result in future impairments for example the companys revenue growth rate could be lower than projected due to economic industry or competitive factors or the discount rate used in the companys cash flow model could increase due to a change in market interest rates additionally future goodwill impairment charges may be necessary if the companys market capitalization decreased due to a decline in the trading price of the companys common stock income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized federal state and foreign tax authorities regularly audit the company like other multi national companies and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed the company uses a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes actual outcomes could result in a change in reported income tax expense for a particular period for example the companys effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries which have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries which have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting or other laws regulations principles and interpretations the company is subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against it although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from its historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on the companys operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made see item note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion table of contents the company has provided valuation allowances against deferred tax assets primarily arising from the acquisition of seven in due to the dormancy of the companies generating the tax assets or due to income tax rules limiting the availability of the losses to offset future taxable income during the company released approximately million of certain valuation allowances that were no longer needed principally for certain of the companys united kingdom and australian subsidiaries exit reserves the company records reserves for the consolidation of workforce and facilities of acquired companies the exit plans are approved by company management prior to or shortly after the acquisition date the exit plans provide for severance pay lease abandonment costs and other related expenses a change in any of the assumptions used to estimate the exit reserves that result in a decrease to the reserve would result in a decrease to goodwill any change in assumptions that result in an increase to the exit reserves would result in a charge to income exit reserves are adjusted when facts regarding a particular reserve have changed indicating that the original reserve assumptions are no longer valid for example the sublease assumptions originally used in computing a reserve for a vacant leased property could become invalid because of a change in circumstances of a sublease tenant requiring a recalculation of the correct reserve balance during the company reached an agreement for an early termination of the remaining lease related to exit reserves for acquisitions completed in and and the remaining reserve balance was reversed see item note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further
