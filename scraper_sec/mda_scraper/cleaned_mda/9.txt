statements see forward looking statements for a discussion of uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with these statements overview our business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance we previously reported business segments which included our corporate operations and the operations of each one of our wholly owned subsidiaries in order to better reflect our operations as a diversified media company and to reflect certain changes in the way our management receives internal financial information we determined it appropriate under statement no disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information to aggregate previously reported segments and identify new segments by type of business rather than by names of individual operating entities as a result we changed our reportable business segments in to the following i publishing ii broadcasting iii telecommunications iv printing services and v other our publishing segment consists of a daily newspaper the milwaukee journal sentinel and more than community newspapers and shoppers our broadcasting segment consists of radio stations and television stations in states our telecommunications segment consists of wholesale and business to business telecommunications services provided through a high speed fiber optic telecommunications network that covers more than route miles in states our printing services segment reflects the operations of our printing and assembly and fulfillment business our other segment consists of a label printing business and a direct marketing services business also included in other are corporate expenses and eliminations acquisition and

decrease in classified advertising in our publishing businesses service disconnections and price reductions in our telecommunications business and the consolidation of our u s printing services operations and the continued slowdown in our publication printing services business these decreases were partially offset by increases in olympic political and issue advertising in our television broadcasting business in addition operating revenue in was adversely impacted by million from preempted advertising due to the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations on television and radio stations following the september terrorist attacks the decrease in total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to the decrease in the total cost of newsprint the discontinuation of goodwill broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from our

expense and the adverse impact on third quarter earnings following the september terrorist attacks offset by the decrease in the profit margin on telecommunication services effective january we adopted statement no goodwill and other intangible assets and accordingly we ceased amortizing goodwill broadcast licenses and network affiliation agreements if statement no had been adopted effective january our total operating earnings would have been million our consolidated ebitda in was million an increase of million or compared to million in ebitda is defined as operating earnings plus depreciation and amortization we believe the presentation of ebitda is relevant and useful because it helps improve our investors ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates our management uses ebitda among other things to evaluate our operating performance to value prospective acquisitions and as a component of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel in addition our lenders use ebitda to measure our ability to service our debt ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ebitda should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity ebitda as we calculate it may not be comparable to ebitda measures reported by other companies in addition ebitda does not represent funds available for discretionary use the following table presents a reconciliation of our operating earnings to ebitda by segment for and depreciation

advertising revenue in was million an increase of million or compared to million in the increase is comprised of a million increase in daily newspaper retail preprints and a million increase in community newspaper retail advertising and inserts in part due to rate increases offset by a million decrease in daily newspaper retail rop run of press advertisements we believe the shift toward retail preprints in was due in part to changes in marketing strategies of certain major national retail advertisers additionally in many advertisers reduced or eliminated their newspaper advertisements following the september terrorist attacks classified advertising revenue in was million a decrease of million or compared to million in at the daily newspaper decreases in employment advertising of million and real estate advertising of million were partially offset by increases in automotive advertising of million and general advertising of million the decrease in employment advertising which accounted for almost of total classified advertising in represented a decrease from we believe the decrease in employment advertising resulted primarily from continuing economic uncertainty however with each quarter in compared to the decrease in total classified advertising has reduced the increase in automotive advertising is primarily attributed to auto manufacturers promoting financing programs general advertising revenue in was million an increase of million or compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in general rop

average net paid circulation for milwaukee journal sentinels weekday edition and decrease in average net paid circulation for milwaukee journal sentinels sunday edition a decrease in paid circulation for our community newspapers and greater discounts given to new subscribers in january we eliminated home delivery of the milwaukee journal sentinel in all but counties in southeastern wisconsin as of the end of this decision contributed to a decrease in net paid circulation for the daily and sunday edition of and respectively on june in an effort to increase readership in certain areas of milwaukee county we began offering greater discounts on home delivery and single copy sales circulation in those areas has increased since offering the discounts other revenue which consists primarily of revenue from commercial printing opportunities at the print plants for our community newspapers and shoppers in accounted for of total publishing revenue compared to in other revenue in was million a decrease of million or compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributed to reduced press runs and page counts from existing commercial printing customers and the loss of commercial

telecommunications operating earnings into worldcom and global crossing together accounted for and of our telecommunications revenue in and respectively global crossing filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in january and worldcom filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in july we have a pre bankruptcy receivable net of applicable set off accounts payable from worldcom of million we recorded a

global crossing is currently expected to exit from bankruptcy in may worldcom also has a right to accept or reject our contract with them as part of its exit from bankruptcy which is not currently expected to happen before late or we do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and commercial customers in advance of providing services

requirements over the term of the contract in the unlikely event that newsprint is no longer required in our business our commitment would expire without obligation purchase commitments related to capital expenditures for our daily newspapers new production facility were approximately million as of december we expect to spend up to million on this project scheduled to be completed in early as of december we have spent million on this project in addition we have the right to broadcast certain television programs during the years under contracts aggregating million we have million of standby letters of credit for business insurance purposes critical accounting policies our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related footnote disclosures on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to doubtful accounts property and equipment intangible assets income taxes litigation pension and other postretirement benefits we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors we specifically review historical write off activity by market large customer concentrations customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings credit history etc we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other customers we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment if our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required property and equipment we assign useful lives for our property and equipment based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate the majority of the property and equipment a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a companys assets undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill broadcast licenses and other indefinite lived intangible assets account for and of total assets in and respectively the annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under statement no require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value including assumptions about cash flow growth rates of our businesses additionally the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed accordingly we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement no to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase respectively accrued income taxes the internal revenue service and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns from time to time the irs and the state departments of revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments nonetheless we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions administrative proceedings and claims when necessary we may need to record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims a third party administrator is used to process all claims liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future we rely upon actuarial valuations to determine pension costs and funding we provide the actuarial firms with certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations such as o the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations o the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations o the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on postretirement obligations and o the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid postretirement benefits moodys aa corporate bonds as of the measurement date is the benchmark we use to determine the assumed discount rate which was reduced from in to for we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits such as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreased from in to in and the rate of compensation increase in and changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan we review these assumptions on an annual basis we also rely upon actuarial valuations to determine post retirement benefit costs other than pension we provide the actuarial firms with the assumption of the discount rate and medical cost inflation these assumptions could have a significant effect on our obligation the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation the medical cost of inflation is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations new accounting standards effective january we adopted statement no business combinations and statement no statement no addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations completed after june as required by statement no we performed transitional impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the resulting impairment charges of million million after tax were recorded during the first quarter ended march and are reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of earnings effective january we adopted statement no accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of as well as broadening the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations accordingly the closures of fox cities newspapers and ipc communication services sa as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements have been treated as discontinued operations in june statement no accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued statement no addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies the previous guidance on the subject it requires among other things that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than at the commitment date to the exit or disposal plan the provisions for statement no are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december accordingly statement no may affect when future costs associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized effect of inflation our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation we have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity cost containment programs and where the competitive environment exists increased selling prices however changes in newsprint prices could have an impact on costs which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term notes payable to banks and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business however a change in the interest rate is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings before income taxes in addition we have shut down our operations outside the united states and have not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments many of our unitholders have borrowed funds to pay for their purchase of units dividends on our common stock passed through to our unitholders have in the past helped our unitholders make required periodic interest payments on those loans increases in the interest rates on unitholder loans could result in our unitholders seeking increased dividends from us dividends are established by our board of directors in their sole discretion and we are under no obligation to pay dividends on our common stock a increase in the interest rate on unitholder loans is not expected to have a material impact on dividends declared by our board of directors
