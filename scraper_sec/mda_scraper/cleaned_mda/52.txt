reportable segments fiber and data equipment and telecom a complete overview of the operations of each reportable segment is included in item business beginning on page executive summary highlights in we made progress with our strategy to grow revenue within our business and broadband services all revenue from our fiber and data segment and equipment segment and a portion of our telecom segment revenue in of our total consolidated revenue was from business and broadband services compared to in and in consolidated revenue increased or compared to due to growth in both the wholesale and business channel revenue in our fiber and data segment and growth in our equipment segment partially offset by a modest decline in our telecom segment ebitda of in increased compared to management believes this is an important financial measure as it represents our ability to generate cash flow and is used internally in evaluating our performance a reconciliation of net income to ebitda can be found in the non gaap measures section ebitda growth in our business segments is offsetting the decline in our traditional telecom ebitda net income of declined compared to we completed our million multi year construction of a middle mile fiber network as part of our greater minnesota broadband collaboration project under the broadband technology opportunities program btop of the national telecommunications information administration ntia of which m was reimbursed over the three year grant period we launched a unified brand as enventis across our entire service area business trends the following discussion highlights key trends management believes are affecting our business business and wholesale services we expect demand for advanced business communications services to continue to grow we will focus on delivering integrated voice and data services including high capacity ethernet mpls and other fiber based services as well as expanding our managed and hosted cloud services we believe the demands of commercial and enterprise sized businesses will continue to evolve allowing them to keep connected with cost effective flexible and scalable communication solutions we are focused on offering competitive products and services to meet their business needs we foresee business customers shifting from traditional technology and services to voip and or cloud based services cloud based service offerings will be an area of focus in the future providing our customers a dynamic solution taking advantage of more efficient and flexible technology environments in a cost effective manner continued success will hinge on our ability to offer attractive bundles combining our hosted voip service with internet and data service local or long distance our singlelink unified communications product is a hosted service offering customers a single centrally managed voip communications solution we are focused on selling to customers in targeted geographical markets table of contents demand for our fiber based transport and access services continues revenue in the fiber and data segment is growing despite industry consolidation technological migration customer network optimization and price compression our fiber based and access services provide support to wireless carriers who continue to see growth in data consumption requiring the need for increased bandwidth in the past few years our network has undergone significant enhancements and expansion through capital investments we expanded our fiber network to sioux falls south dakota and fargo north dakota increased our capacity in the des moines iowa market and gained immediate access to the fargo north dakota market with the acquisition of ideaone our greater minnesota broadband collaborative project extended our network to enable us to provide high capacity broadband services to rural communities and connect health care facilities libraries higher education institutions and public offices and provided us alternate paths to duluth minnesota and fargo north dakota more recently we focused on last mile fiber builds expanding our reach directly to customers and wireless carrier networks legacy services revenue associated with our legacy services is anticipated to be adversely impacted by an expected decline in access lines due to intense competition and product substitution as customers opt for alternative technologies such as wireless voip and cable to help mitigate this trend we will continue to focus on providing the customer with exceptional service along with offering competitive multi service bundles with term discounts and the ability for customers to customize their package including digital tv high speed internet voice services and features we remain committed to managing costs as we expect continued declines in the telecom segment net profitability table of contents results of operations fiber and data segment the following table provides detail of the fiber and data

with advanced data services such as ethernet private line mpls dedicated internet voice and voip services we develop data and internet solutions to meet the needs of our customers business revenue increased or in compared to we remain focused on providing business solutions to meet our customers voice and data needs growth in these customer services is driven by sales of data services including ethernet mpls dedicated internet private line and voip services along with continued success in the fargo north dakota market following our ideaone acquisition we face intense competition for business customers in the markets we serve and experience customer loss and revenue erosion as contract terms expire and customers seek low cost alternatives nonetheless we were able to offset lost revenue associated with customer attrition and price compression by offering a comprehensive array of services such as those described above through our veteran sales staff using a value based selling approach wholesale we provide fiber and data services to regional and national service providers including wireless carriers telecom providers and other service providers we provide fiber based

provide a high bandwidth self healing platform to provide reliable service wholesale revenue increased or in compared to with multi media content and applications becoming a larger part of the wireless traffic bandwidth demands are rapidly rising to support current and future traffic growth wireless carriers require a higher bandwidth connection such as ethernet dwdm and mpls technologies which is driving the revenue growth in wholesale services conversely these services continue to be hampered by industry consolidation technological changes customer network optimization and price compression challenging our ability to grow this revenue stream the number of fiber served cell sites we service increased sites from to sites at december we anticipate continued growth in this area by building to additional cell sites and by upgrading bandwidth and services on existing towers which will be tempered by customer network optimization and price compression cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization cost of services increased or in compared to the main contributors include an increase of in wages and benefits reflecting our commitment to support the growth and activity in this segment an increase of in circuit related expenses to support the increase in revenue an increase of in materials expense related to the sale of our voip product an increase of in

sales are non recurring in nature making this revenue dependent upon attracting new sales from existing and new customers as well as leveraging relationships with our current customer base by adding more value through enhanced product and service offerings equipment hardware revenue declined or in compared to this revenue stream is dependent upon timing size and volume of customer orders although we experienced a decline year over year customers continue to invest in technology and it solutions such as unified communication products data center products cloud computing solutions storage data

as a single point of contact for the support of applications systems and infrastructure equipment services revenue increased or in compared to this growth is consistent with our plan to maximize this higher margin service revenue approximately of the increase is primarily attributable to contract services and support fees revenue due an initiative focusing our customer conversations on service offerings and increased activity performed for a large enterprise customer the remainder of the increase is related to an increase in maintenance revenue maintenance revenue is largely tied to equipment installations and contracts are typically three to five years this revenue stream is cyclical in nature and is subject to timing of projects and renewal opportunities our strategy is to focus on selling professional and support services with our equipment solutions leveraging our resources and allowing our clients to focus on their business initiatives limiting their risk in

miscellaneous local services we also receive reciprocal compensation revenue based on interconnection agreements with wireless carriers who use our network to terminate calls local service revenue declined or in compared to similar to other communication companies we have been subject to industry wide access line declines and price compression driven by intense competition and alternative communication options we experienced a access line decline we also continue to be impacted by fcc order issued in november which reforms core parts of the universal service fund and intercarrier compensation negatively impacting local service revenue as well as network access revenue the order mandated elimination of reciprocal compensation from wireless carriers contributing approximately of the annual decline business customers continue to shift from traditional voice services to voip products and services which are offered by our fiber and data segment and competitors to mitigate the expected local service revenue decline we remain focused on customer retention by providing exceptional service and continuing to lead with our competitive service bundles it is expected this will offset some not all of the telecom segment local service declines network access we provide access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long distance calls on our network we also bill subscriber line charges to our customers for access to the public switched network network access revenue is derived from several federally administered pooling arrangements designed to provide support and distribute funding to incumbent local exchange carriers ilec table of contents network access revenue declined or in compared to the decline is attributable to declines in our access lines and minutes of use on our network driven by competition and network groomingoptimization by the carriers this revenue stream was and will continue to be impacted by regulatory decisions particularly fcc order that established a framework for the reform of the universal service fund and intercarrier compensation provisions in fcc order call for reductions of interstate and intrastate access charges through gradual annual reductions in rates for certain access components however the introduction of the connect america fund caf and increased charges to end user subscribers has helped to mitigate this revenue stream decline broadband we provide residential and business broadband services for monthly recurring revenue broadband services include high speed internet digital tv services and business ethernet and data services broadband revenue increased or in compared to the revenue growth is reflective of the success we have experienced in marketing our multi service bundles which helped drive the and growth in our digital tv and high speed internet dsl customer base respectively and the restructuring of our high speed internet services we strive to provide the best service experiences for our customers we are focused on delivering reliable and competitive broadband services and continue to invest in our broadband network we lead with competitive and flexible multi service bundles which provide pricing discounts and incentives when bundling digital tv internet and or voice services additional savings are given if a customer opts into a six month one or two year agreement in july of we offered our updated service bundles and as of december have more than bundle subscribers consisting of both new and existing customers with approximately opting into a two year agreement we believe the bundles positively impact our customer retention other services revenue other revenue consists primarily of long distance directory publishing sales of wholesale contract services late fees applied to subscriber billings and addmovechange revenue on customer premise equipment other revenue declined or in when compared to the decline is primarily due to lower directory revenue as businesses migrate away from traditional printed directories to online media platforms and long distance revenue resulting from a declining customer base and lower billable minutes it is expected there will be continued declines in other revenue partially due to the industry wide trend of access line declines cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization declined or in compared to the main contributors include a decline of in wages and benefits resulting from a smaller workforce and savings in post retirement benefits due to a plan amendment a decline of in access expense which is a result of lower long distance revenue and a declining customer base a decline of in directory expense in direct correlation to the downward trend of directory revenue a decline of in maintenance contracts a decline of in bad debt expense as a result of higher customer retention associated with our bundles a decline of in reciprocal compensation which is related to the declining revenue as a result of fcc order a net decline of in other expenses an increase of in programming costs related to providing our digital tv service attributed to growth in our digital tv subscriber base and subscriber fees we anticipate additional future increases in programming costs an increase of in circuit expenses associated with providing service to our customers beyond the reach of our network an increase of on losses attributable to asset disposals related to our digital tv and internet services an increase of in equipment repair and maintenance associated with customer equipment repair table of contents selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses

corporate and other consolidated results corporate and other operating income bill processing we provide data processing and billing services to other communication service providers we collect a combination of monthly recurring revenue software license fees and integration services revenue from companies with whom we have established long term data processing relationships bill processing revenue declined or in compared to this revenue stream is dependent upon the timing of performance on contract services including project integration services and license fees related to the sale of our suitesolution product bill processing revenue is also impacted as resources shift to internal projects in an effort to streamline and improve our processes interest expense consolidated interest expense decreased or in following a decrease of or in compared to the respective prior year our year end debt balance current and long term of decreased from through mandatory quarterly payments in the debt balance increased from associated with debt obtained for the ideaone acquisition effective interest rates were and in and respectively we expect similar levels of interest expense in as reported in during the changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are primarily recorded as a component of equity due to designation of the derivatives as cash flow hedges as of january in and the changes in the fair value of the swap agreements were recorded as an adjustment to interest expense income taxes income tax expense was which is a decrease of or compared to the effective tax rate was and for and respectively the effective tax rate in was impacted by the release of income tax reserves and associated interest of respectively the effective tax rate would have been in without the release of the income tax reserves and associated interest inflation it is the opinion of management that the effects of inflation on operating revenue and expenses over the past three years have been immaterial management anticipates this trend will continue in the near future liquidity and capital resources working capital working capital current assets minus current liabilities was as of december compared to working capital of as of december the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and as of december and respectively table of contents capital structure the total capital structure long term and current maturities of long term debt obligations plus shareholders equity of hickorytech was at december reflecting equity and debt this compares to a capital structure of at december reflecting equity and debt in the communications industry debt financing is most often based on multiples of operating cash flows specifically our current use of the senior credit facility is in a leverage ratio of approximately times debt to ebitda as defined in our credit agreement well within acceptable limits for our agreement and our industry we employ an extended term payable financing arrangement for the equipment provisioning portion of our equipment segment and view this arrangement as a structured accounts payable that is paid within days with no separate interest charge as such the extended term payable financing amount of and as of december and respectively is not considered to be part of our capital structure and has been excluded from the above amounts see note extended term payable in our primary source of liquidity was from operations in we did not change our equity capitalization and equity was not a new source of liquidity cash and cash equivalents of at december decreased as compared to in cash and cash equivalents at december our cash balance is a product of timing of our capital expenditures and working capital needs in we repurchased of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase plan cash flows management expects to have the ability to meet current and long term liquidity and capital requirements through operating cash flows cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our credit facility for temporary increases in cash demand we use our cash inflow and for more significant fluctuations in liquidity caused by growth initiatives we utilize our senior credit facility these sources coupled with our access to a revolving credit facility presently unused provide further assurance against interruption in our business plans due to financing our expected primary uses of cash include ongoing operating requirements capital expenditures scheduled principal and interest payments on our credit facility temporary financing of trade accounts receivable and the payment of dividends as they are declared while it is difficult for us to predict the impact economic conditions may have on our business we believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term cash requirements primarily through our operating cash flows we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of december and anticipate that we will be able to plan for and match future liquidity needs with future internal and available external resources our senior credit facility will be the sole external source of financing for the foreseeable future we feel we can adjust the timing and or the number of strategic and growth initiatives according to any limitation which may be imposed by our capital structure or sources of financing we do not anticipate our capital structure will limit growth initiatives over the next months dollars in thousands year ended december net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities

continues to be our primary source of funds cash generated from operations was primarily attributable to net income plus non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization cash generated from operations during decreased compared to which was primarily due to normal fluctuations in our working capital balances these fluctuations are often driven by the timing and volume of customer orders

capital expenditures decreased when comparing to after adjusting for the received in and the received in from the ntia btop grant capital spending continues to be our primary recurring investing activity and allows us to expand and enhance our network and service offerings and remain competitive we continue to focus on strategic investments in success based and network expansion projects such as last mile builds to customer premises fiber connections to cellular towers and expansion in key strategic locations along with required spending to add capacity and maintain our network investment in business services will continue to support growth and customer demand in backhaul transport services optimizing long term revenue opportunities during of our capital spending was success based related to network expansion and reliability focused on maintenance and the remainder was for other miscellaneous projects based on current short range planning we expect our capital spending during to range between and unforeseeable situations or opportunities may arise which could either increase or decrease the amount of capital spending our greater minnesota broadband collaborative project which was being funded in part by the ntia btop grant was completed in july of the project extended our fiber optic network across greater minnesota providing the opportunity for governmental educational and healthcare organizations to access a high capacity broadband network all construction was completed as required under the contract agreement total allowable costs of were incurred during the three year grant and subsequent closeout period seventy percent of this amount or was reimbursed by the ntia financing activities primarily consist of borrowings and payments on our credit facility and the payment of dividends to our shareholders on october we amended our current credit facility proceeds from this amendment were used to repay the outstanding obligations under the previous credit facility the primary reason for the decrease in financing activities is due to entering into an incremental term credit facility in to fund the purchase of ideaone telecom as part of our board of directors authorized stock purchase plan in we acquired and retired shares of our common stock for we did not repurchase shares of our common stock in during the year ended december and we used and in cash to make dividend payments to our shareholders respectively our board of directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of per share representing a increase from the previous dividend

above schedule we have an extended term payable liability of as of december payable in this commitment is not included in the above schedule as of december we recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately net of tax excluding interest the liability has not been assigned to any particular year in the table above due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing and necessity of future cash outflows table of contents reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we also use certain non gaap measures including ebitda and ebitda as defined in our credit agreement to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of our historical results and trends these non gaap measures are also used to manage and evaluate the operating performance of our reportable segments these financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss as a measure of performance and net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity ebitda is included as a supplemental

stated in this annual report on form k are based upon hickorytechs consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and where applicable conform to the accounting principles as prescribed by federal and state regulatory authorities we presently give accounting recognition to the actions of regulators where appropriate the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities senior management has discussed the development and selection of accounting estimates and the related management discussion and analysis disclosure with the audit committee for a summary of significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies there were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the year ended december revenue recognition see note summary of significant accounting policies we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery of the product has occurred or a service has been provided iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments uncollectible accounts are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts and removed from the accounts receivable balances when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful this allowance is based on the likelihood of recoverability of accounts receivables based on past experience and managements best estimates of current bad debt exposures if our customers creditworthiness deteriorates actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which would have an impact on our financial results inventories and materials and supplies we value our inventories using the lower of cost or market method we adjust our inventory carrying value for estimated excess obsolete or unmarketable inventory to the estimated market value based on replacement costs or upon assumptions about future consumption technology changes customer demands and market conditions our materials and supplies are valued at cost we adjust our materials and supplies when circumstances indicate the carrying value is not fully recoverable our estimates are based on estimated use in capital projects reductions to the carrying values of inventory and materials and supplies establish a new lower cost basis for inventory and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not restore the former cost basis or increase a formerly established cost basis financial derivative instruments we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of our interest expense we enter into fixed interest rate swap agreements financial derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our variable interest rate debt our interest rate swaps increase or decrease the amount of cash paid for interest depending on the increase or decrease of interest required on our variable rate debt we account for our financial derivative instruments in accordance with asc derivatives and hedging asc requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met the fair value estimate of our interest rate swaps represent the net present value of future cash flows based on projections of the three month libor rate over the life of each swap our interest rate swaps are designated as hedges therefore we record changes in fair value of the effective portions of cash flow hedges as a component of other comprehensive income in the current period and subsequently reclassify into earnings when the underlying hedged transactions affects earnings amounts related to our derivatives will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as interest payments are accrued or made on our variable rate debt the ineffective portion of the fair value of derivatives is recognized directly in earnings hedge ineffectiveness is attributable to the swaps having a non zero fair value at the time they were designated if we were to terminate our interest rate swap positions any related balance in accumulated other comprehensive income would immediately be recognized in earnings or reclassified into earnings as the interest payments are made dependent on the facts and circumstances of the termination the changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings see note financial derivative instruments goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value we perform a second step to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using industry and peer specific valuation methods and trading multiples common to our industry during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test table of contents income taxes in accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes are based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year in providing for deferred taxes we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies if tax regulations operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary from our assumptions we may be required to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense we are required to recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority see additional disclosures in note income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating the current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatments of items such as deferred revenue for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is not likely the carrying value of the deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase an allowance in a period it must be included as an expense within the tax provision in the statements of income we had valuation allowances of and at december and respectively due to uncertainty about the realization of certain benefits associated with net operating losses generated in the states of iowa and minnesota in addition we carry reserves for income tax contingencies these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities we believe our current income tax reserves are adequate however the ultimate outcome may differ from estimates and assumptions could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in the consolidated statements of income post retirement benefits we provide retirement savings benefits and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees the post retirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies these assumptions include but are not limited to the discount rate and the expected health care cost trend rate changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly impact our post retirement benefit costs and obligations see note summary of significant accounting policies along with note employee retirement benefits property plant and equipment depreciation for financial statement purposes is determined using the straight line method based on the estimated economical useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets our regulated ilec operations use a composite depreciation method the composite depreciation rates on the ilec telephone plant were and for and respectively all other property plant and equipment are depreciated over estimated useful lives of to years maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred data on utilization of equipment and asset retirements is reviewed on a consistent basis to determine if adjustments to our depreciation rates are needed significant judgment is required in selecting the appropriate estimated economic life of communications and business property and equipment due to the rapid changes in technology along with the competitive environment see note summary of significant accounting policies incentive and stock based compensation our employee incentive compensation plans provide for distributions based on achievement of specific organizational operating results or individual employee objectives for share based payments we apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for and recording compensation cost compensation charges are recognized over the requisite service period as specified by the stock award plan table of contents performance and stock based awards
