items affecting results special items include restructuring and exit costs years presented are fiscal unless noted otherwiseexecutive summarynet sales of billion in increased from representing a increase from pricemix a increase from the impact of an extra week and a increase in volume the increase in volume was due to an increase in sales of sheet for material handling applications along with increased sales volume of compounds and sheet to the automotive and commercial construction end markets the pricemix changes related to a product mix that included a greater percentage of higher priced products and the impact of changing raw material prices passed through as changes in selling price operating earnings excluding special items increased by million to million in the million increase in earnings was primarily caused by improvements in our operations from our turnaround efforts this increase overcame a million change in bad debt expense from reversals in the prior year the increase for the year also reflects the impact of an additional week which accounts for approximately million of the total change in vs the higher gross margin was caused by increases in sales volume production efficiencies and better product mixduring we showed continued improvements from our turnaround efforts in our color and specialty compounds segment which we began in the first quarter of we also realized continued momentum in our turnaround efforts in the custom sheet and rollstock segment which we began in the third quarter of outlookthe company gained momentum on its key priorities and turnaround efforts in which provided for the improved results and established a stronger foundation for future earnings growth we expect to continue to build on this foundation and execute on our growth strategy which focuses on shifting our product mix towards more specialized and higher margin products we expect continued improvements from our turnaround efforts in our color and specialty compounds and custom sheet and rollstock segments the packaging technologies segment is positioned to capitalize on its expanded customer base in while recent customer order patterns have remained stable and resin costs have experienced downward pressure slow and uncertain demand in the markets we serve and dynamic raw material costs may impact our financial results in future periods we expect low to moderate sales volume growth in as well as higher selling prices and a continued shift in mix to higher margin business which should result in solid improvement in our results for the full year compared to we remain committed to providing value to our stockholders through the completion of our turnaround strategy the shift of mix to more specialty products and focus on sustainable

of asset sales because mandatory prepayments are based on future operating results and events we cannot predict the amount or timing of such prepayments no excess cash flow payment is required to be

interest rates purchase and take or pay obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements the table does not include long term contingent liabilities deferred compensation obligations and liabilities related to deferred taxes because the company is not certain when these liabilities will become due table of contentscritical accounting policies and estimatesin preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we must select and apply various accounting policies our most significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in order to apply our accounting policies we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities shareholders equity revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements in making such estimates we rely on historical experience market and other conditions and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable accounting policies estimates and judgments that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognitionwe recognize revenue as product is shipped and title passes to the customer we manufacture our products either to standard specifications or to custom specifications agreed upon with the customer in advance and we inspect our products prior to shipment to ensure that these specifications are met we monitor and track product returns and the corresponding provisions established despite our efforts to improve our quality and service to customers we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same or better return rates than we have in the past any significant increase in returns could have a material negative impact on our operating resultsallowance for doubtful trade receivableswe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers creditworthiness as determined by our review of their current credit information we monitor market and economic conditions as well as collections and payments from our customers we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical write off experience specific customer collection issues identified and market and economic conditions while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established actual credit loss rates may differ from our estimates any significant increase in credit losses in excess of our expectations could have a material negative impact on the value of our trade receivables and operating results and cash flows inventory valuation and obsolescence we value inventories at the lower of i cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or ii the current estimated market value of the inventory we also buy scrap and recyclable material including regrind material to be used in future production we record these inventories initially at purchase price and based on the inventory aging and other considerations for realizable value we write down the carrying value to realizable value where appropriate we review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete inventory a significant increase in the demand for our raw materials could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand in addition most of our business involves the manufacture of custom products where the loss of a specific customer could increase the amount of excess or obsolete inventory on hand although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and operating resultsproperty plant and equipment property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation major additions and improvements are capitalized maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred depreciation expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets in compliance with asc property plant and equipment fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets such assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets such impairment tests compare estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset if an impairment is indicated the asset is written down to its fair value or if fair value is not readily determinable to an estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows and a corresponding loss is recorded the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of fixed asset impairments and the factors which led to these impairments goodwill we follow the guidance of asc business combinations in recording goodwill arising from a business combination as the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that benefits from the acquired business our annual goodwill impairment testing date is the first day of the companys fourth quarter in addition a goodwill impairment assessment is performed if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount the table of contentsgoodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires the company to make assumptions regarding fair value the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using a number of factors including projected future operating results and business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows discount rates the allocation of shared or corporate items and comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping the estimated fair values of each reporting unit are compared to the respective carrying values which includes allocated goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the recorded and unrecorded assets and liabilities of the reporting unit any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount management believes the estimates of the underlying components of fair value are reasonable the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of goodwill impairments and the factors that led to these impairments other intangible assets costs allocated to customer relationships product formulations and other intangible assets are based on their fair value at the date of acquisition the cost of other intangible assets is amortized on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful life ranging from two to nineteen years in accordance with the asc intangibles goodwill and other all amortizable intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss such an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible asset if the review indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset the carrying amount of the intangible asset is reduced by the estimated cash flow shortfall on a discounted basis and a corresponding loss is recorded the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of intangible asset impairments and the factors that led to these impairments income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are recognized for credit and net operating loss carryforwards and then assessed to determine the likelihood of realization valuation allowances are established to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized expectations of future earnings the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities the ability to carry back losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year and tax planning strategies are the primary drivers underlying our evaluation of valuation allowances deferred tax amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable and expensed if our estimates of future earnings and outcomes of tax planning strategies are ultimately inaccurate deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings on foreign consolidated subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time if those undistributed foreign earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested we would be required to recognize additional income tax expensethe company accounts for income taxes under the updated provisions of asc income taxes under this topic of the asc in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit tax authorities regularly examine the companys returns in the jurisdictions in which spartech does business management regularly assesses the tax risk of the companys return filing positions and believes its accruals for uncertain tax benefits are adequate as of november litigation and other contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business including environmental matters management routinely assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to those matters as well as ranges of probable losses to the extent losses are reasonably estimable in accordance with asc contingencies accruals for such contingencies are recorded to the extent that management concludes their occurrence is probable and the financial impact should an adverse outcome occur is reasonably estimable disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to past experience interpretation of relevant laws or regulations and the specifics and status of each matter if the assessment of the various factors changes the estimates may change that may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in a future reporting periodtable of contentsrestructuring and exit coststhe company follows the guidance of asc exit or disposal cost obligations in recognizing restructuring costs related to exit or disposal cost obligations detailed documentation is maintained and updated to ensure that accruals are properly supported if management determines that there is a change in estimate the accruals are adjusted to reflect this changemerger and transaction costsin conjunction with the definitive merger agreement under which polyone corporation will acquire all the outstanding shares of spartech the company has incurred various costs triggered by and directly related to the merger transaction in the fourth quarter of spartech recognized million of merger and transaction costs including stock compensation expense from the acceleration of vesting of

policies as well as the impact of recently issued accounting standards see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statementsitem a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate riskwe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt facilities at november we had million of debt subject to variable short term interest rates and million of fixed rate debt outstanding based upon the november balance of the floating rate debt a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would cause an estimated million impact on annual interest expense we are not currently engaged in any interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations the fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to changes in interest rates and the november fair values of such instruments are disclosed in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements foreign currency exchange risk we are also exposed to market risk through changes in foreign currency exchange rates including the canadian dollar euro and mexican peso based upon our november currency exposures a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar euro and mexican peso would cause a decrease in future earnings of approximately million million and million respectivelycommodity price riskthe company uses certain commodities primarily plastic resins in its manufacturing processes the cost of operations can be affected as the market for these commodities changes as the price of resin increases or decreases market prices for the companys products will also generally increase or decrease this will typically lead to higher or lower average selling prices and will impact the companys gross profit and operating income the impact on operating income is due to a lag in matching the change in raw material cost of goods sold and the change in product sales prices the company attempts to minimize its exposure to resin price changes by entering into indexed product sales pricing contracts with customers and carefully managing the quantity of its inventory on hand see part i item a risk factors for additional disclosures about market risktable of contents
