accounting policies and estimates executive summary we are a leading independent specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on helping patients attain a healthy and youthful appearance and self image through the development and marketing in the us and canada of products for the treatment of dermatological and aesthetic conditions we offer a broad range of products addressing various conditions or aesthetics improvements including facial wrinkles glabellar lines acne fungal infections hyperpigmentation photoaging psoriasis actinic keratosis bronchospasms external genital and perianal wartscondyloma acuminata seborrheic dermatitis and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin during the fourth quarter of we acquired substantially all of the assets of graceway for approximately million in cash after our successful bid at a bankruptcy auction graceways commercial pharmaceutical product portfolio includes on market prescription products and important development projects primarily in dermatology and womens health specialties also during the fourth quarter of we closed the sale of our liposonix business to solta for aggregate cash consideration of approximately million and continuing milestone payments based upon the commercial success of the liposonix products our current product lines are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields the dermatological field represents products for the treatment of acne and acne related dermatological conditions and non acne dermatological conditions the non dermatological field represents products in the respiratory and womens health specialties and products for the treatment of urea cycle disorder our non dermatological field also includes contract revenues associated with licensing agreements and authorized generic agreements our acne and acne related dermatological product lines include solodynreg and zianareg our non acne dermatological product lines include dysportreg loproxreg perlanereg restylanereg vanosreg and zyclarareg our non dermatological product lines include ammonulreg and buphenylreg sodium phenylbutyrate powder and tablets financial information about segments we operate in one business segment pharmaceuticals our current pharmaceutical franchises are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields information on revenues operating income identifiable assets and supplemental revenue of our business franchises appears in the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof key aspects of our business we derive a majority of our revenue from our primary products dysportreg perlanereg restylanereg solodynreg vanosreg zianareg and zyclarareg we believe that sales of our primary products will constitute a significant portion of our revenue for table of contents we have built our business by executing a four part growth strategy promoting existing brands developing new products and important product line extensions entering into and utilizing strategic collaborations and acquiring complementary products technologies and businesses our core philosophy is to cultivate high integrity relationships of trust and confidence with the foremost physicians in the us and canada we rely on third parties to manufacture our products we estimate customer demand for our prescription products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies the data represents extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies and are estimates of historical demand levels we estimate customer demand for our non prescription products primarily through internal data that we compile we observe trends from these data and coupled with certain proprietary information prepare demand forecasts that are the basis for our purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for our products overestimates of demand and sudden changes in market conditions may result in excessive inventory production and underestimates may result in an inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand as a result miscalculation of customer demand or relatively small delays in our receipt of manufactured products could result in revenues being deferred or lost our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains approximately of our gross revenues are typically derived from two major drug wholesale concerns depending on the customer we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the customer or at the time of receipt by the customer net of estimated provisions as a result of certain amendments made to our distribution services agreement with mckesson our exclusive us distributor of our aesthetics products dysportreg perlanereg and restylanereg we began recognizing revenue on these products upon the shipment from mckesson to physicians beginning in the second quarter of consequently variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses we have distribution services agreements with our two largest wholesale customers we review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers by reviewing periodic inventory reports that are supplied to us by our major wholesalers in accordance with the distribution services agreements we rely wholly upon our wholesale and retail chain drugstore customers to effect the distribution allocation of substantially all of our prescription products we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products based on our review of the periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and the estimated demand for our products based on prescription and other data are reasonable we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers taken as a whole are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies and that our trade practices which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts are typical of the industry we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and retail chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our prescription products consistent with prescriptions written by licensed health care providers because many of our prescription products compete in multi source markets it is important that licensed health care providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not improperly substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended and prescribed medicis brand we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at wholesale and retail chain drugstore customers we believe such availability reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions shortages and backorders which could result in lost sales we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail chain drugstore customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce from time to time we may enter into business arrangements eg loans or investments involving our customers and those arrangements may be reviewed by federal and state regulators table of contents purchases by any given customer during any given period may be above or below reported prescription volumes of any of our products during the same period resulting in fluctuations of product inventory in the distribution channel in addition we consistently assess our product mix and portfolio to promote a high level of profitability and revenues and to ensure that our products are responsive to consumer tastes and changes to regulatory classifications during early we discontinued our triazreg branded products and decided to no longer promote our plexionreg branded products recent developments as described in more detail

intangible assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an table of contents impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows if an asset carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows the asset is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset groupings carrying amount and its present value of anticipated net cash flows based on the best information available including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the assets carrying value when it is determined that the useful lives of assets are shorter than originally estimated and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets we will accelerate the rate of amortization charges in order to fully amortize the assets over their new

december as holders of the old notes may require us to offer to repurchase their old notes for cash on june the old notes were classified as a long term liability as of december accounts receivable net increased million or from million at december to million at december the increase was primarily due to a million increase in gross sales during the month of december as compared to the month of december as our standard payment terms are days orders that occur during the last month of a quarter are typically not due for payment until after the end of the quarter gross sales during the month of december were million or of the total gross sales for the fourth quarter of as compared to gross sales during the month of december of million or of total gross sales for the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding calculated as accounts receivable net as of the end of the reporting period divided by total gross sales for the quarter multiplied by the number of days in the quarter was days as

review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major table of contents wholesalers by reviewing periodic inventory reports that are supplied to us by our major wholesalers in accordance with the distribution services agreements we rely wholly upon our wholesale and retail chain drugstore customers to effect the distribution allocation of substantially all of our prescription products we believe that our major wholesalers are reducing inventory levels during the first two months of the quarter and purchasing up to the distribution agreement levels during the last month of the quarter gross sales of our products are at or below reported prescription levels we also defer the recognition of revenue for certain sales of inventory into the distribution channel that are in excess of eight weeks of projected demand and we defer the recognition of revenue of our aesthetics products dysportreg perlanereg and restylanereg until our exclusive us distributor mckesson ships these products to physicians there has not been a significant change in inventories in the distribution channel during the quarter ended december management believes existing cash and short term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements for the foreseeable future our cash and short term investments are available for dividends milestone payments related to our product development collaborations strategic investments acquisitions of companies or products complementary to our business the repayment of outstanding indebtedness repurchases of our outstanding securities and other potential large scale needs in addition we may consider incurring additional indebtedness and issuing additional debt or equity securities in the

financial condition could change materially in future periods however no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms or at all to fund such activities as of december our short term investments included million of auction rate floating securities our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions during the three months ended march we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for the auction rate floating securities and since that time we have been unable to liquidate our holdings in such securities as a result these affected auction rate floating securities are now considered illiquid and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity or until a future auction on these investments is successful during we liquidated million of our auction rate floating securities at par operating

made on june and or upon the occurrence of a change in control holders of the old notes may require us to offer to repurchase their old notes for cash on june and or upon the occurrence of a change in control holders of the new notes may require us to offer to repurchase their new notes for cash under gaap if an obligation is due on demand or will be due on demand within one year from the balance sheet date even though liquidation may not be expected within that period it should be classified as a current liability accordingly the outstanding balance of old notes along with the deferred tax

million of the old notes and million of deferred tax liabilities were classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the million of deferred tax liabilities were included within

prior to july we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock since july we have paid quarterly cash dividends aggregating approximately million on our common stock in addition on december we announced that our board of directors had declared a cash dividend of per issued and outstanding share of common stock which was paid on january to our stockholders of record at the close of business on january any future determinations to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition operating results capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant fair value measurements we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of our auction rate floating security investments which totaled million at december these securities were included in long term investments at december our auction rate floating securities are classified as available for sale securities and are reflected at fair value in prior periods due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities quoted market prices were readily available which would qualify as level under asc fair value measurements and disclosure however due to events in credit markets that began during the first quarter of the auction events for most of these instruments failed and therefore we determined the estimated fair values of these securities beginning in the first quarter of utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis these analyses consider among other items the collateralization underlying the security investments the expected future cash flows including the final maturity associated with the securities and the expectation of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction these securities were also compared when possible to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us due to these events we reclassified these instruments as level during the first quarter of on july the broker through which we purchased auction rate floating securities agreed to repurchase from us three auction rate floating securities with an aggregate par value of million at par the adjusted basis of these securities was million in aggregate as a result of an other than temporary impairment loss of million recorded during the year

assuming the old notes and new notes will not have any redemptions or conversions into shares of our class a common stock until their respective maturities in and but does not include any contingent interest the amount of interest ultimately paid in future years could change if any of the old notes or new notes are converted or redeemed and or if contingent interest becomes payable if certain future criteria are met other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under research and development and consulting contracts we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of certain product development and license agreements payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental regulatory and or commercial milestones because the achievement and timing of these milestones are not fixed or reasonably determinable such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the above table the total amount of potential future milestone payments related to development and license agreements is approximately million purchase orders for raw materials finished goods and other goods and services are not included in the above table we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are table of contents enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs based on expected demand and are fulfilled by our vendors in most cases with relatively short timetables we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or finished goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our short term expected requirements we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty we have excluded from the table above approximately million in reserves for uncertain income tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which cash settlement with the respective taxing authority will occur if any the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances chargebacks rebates returns and other pricing adjustments depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events which could include among other risks changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns our significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of part iv of this report exhibits financial statement schedules we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition revenue from our product sales is recognized pursuant to asc revenue recognition accordingly revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery of the products has occurred iii the selling price is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel we do not provide any material forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns if the product is damaged or depending on the customer and product if it is returned within six months prior to expiration or up to months after expiration our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers and depending on the customer revenue is recognized based upon shipment fob shipping point or receipt fob destination net of estimated provisions as a result of certain amendments made to our distribution services agreement with mckesson our exclusive us distributor of our aesthetics products dysportreg perlanereg and restylanereg we began recognizing revenue on these products upon the shipment from mckesson to physicians beginning in the second quarter of as a general practice we do not ship prescription product that has less than months until its expiration date we also authorize returns for damaged products and credits for expired products in accordance with our returned goods policy and procedures the shelf life associated with our products is up to months depending on the product the majority of our prescription products have a shelf life of approximately months table of contents we enter into licensing arrangements with other parties whereby we receive contract revenue based on the terms of the agreement the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the level of our continuing involvement in the manufacture and delivery of licensed products if we have continuing involvement the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of continuing involvement in addition if our licensing arrangements require no continuing involvement and payments are merely based on the passage of time we assess such payments for revenue recognition under the collectibility criteria of asc items deducted from gross revenue provisions for estimated product returns sales discounts and chargebacks are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized provisions for managed care and medicaid rebates and consumer rebate and loyalty programs are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the later of the date at which revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is offered in addition we defer revenue for certain sales of inventory into the distribution channel that are in excess of eight weeks of projected demand these deductions from gross revenue are established by us as our best estimate based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves including but not limited to prescription data industry trends competitive developments and estimated inventory in the distribution channel our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on inventory information reported to us by our major wholesale customers for which we have inventory management agreements historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled which we purchase from ims health inc one of the leading providers of prescription based information we regularly monitor internal as well as external data from our wholesalers in order to assess the reasonableness of the information obtained from external sources we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products as well as our internal information regarding our products these deductions from gross revenue are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance as a reserve within current liabilities or as an addition to accrued expenses we identify product returns by their manufacturing lot number because we manufacture in bulk lot sizes can be large and as a result sales of any individual lot may occur over several periods as a result we are unable to specify if actual returns or credits relate to a sale that occurred in the current period or a prior period and therefore we cannot specify how much of the provision recorded relates to sales made in prior periods however we believe the process discussed above including the tracking of returns by lot and the availability of other internal and external data allows us to reasonably estimate the level of product returns as well as estimate the level of expected credits associated with rebates or chargebacks our accounting policies for revenue recognition have a significant impact on our reported results and rely on certain estimates that require complex and subjective judgment on the part of our management if the levels of product returns inventory in the distribution channel cash discounts chargebacks managed care and medicaid rebates and consumer rebate and loyalty programs fluctuate significantly and or if our estimates do not adequately reserve for these reductions of gross product revenues our reported net product revenues could be negatively affected table of contents the following table shows the activity of each reserve associated with the various sales provisions that serve to reduce our accounts

dec reserve for sales returns we account for returns of product by establishing an allowance based on our estimate of revenues recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned in the future we estimate the rate of future product returns for our established products based on our historical experience the relative risk of return based on expiration date and other qualitative factors that could impact the level of future product returns such as competitive developments product discontinuations and our introduction of similar new products historical experience and the other qualitative factors are assessed on a product specific basis as part of our compilation of our estimate of future product returns we also estimate inventory in the distribution channel by monitoring inventories held by our distributors as well as prescription trends to help us assess whether historical rates of return continue to be appropriate given current conditions we estimate returns of new products primarily based on our historical acceptance of our new product introductions by our customers and product returns experience of similar products products that have similar characteristics at various stages of their life cycle and other available information pertinent to the intended use and marketing of the new product changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us we do not provide material pricing incentives to our distributors that are intended to have them assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business our actual experience and the qualitative factors that we use to determine the necessary accrual for future product returns are susceptible to change based on unforeseen events and uncertainties we assess the trends that could affect our estimates and make changes to the accrual quarterly when it appears product returns may differ from our original estimates the provision for product returns was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for product returns increased million from million as of december to million as of table of contents december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and in the reserve during the year ended december was primarily related to additional estimated required reserves for newly launched products the provision for product returns was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for product returns decreased million from million as of december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods was primarily related to additional estimated required reserves for newly launched products if the amount of our estimated quarterly returns increased by percent our sales returns reserve at december would increase by approximately million and corresponding revenue would decrease by the same amount conversely if the amount of our estimated quarterly returns decreased by percent our sales returns reserve at december would decrease by approximately million and corresponding revenue would increase by the same amount we consider the sensitivity analysis of a percent variance between estimated and actual sales returns to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in estimating our sales returns reserves for newly launched products if the returns reserve percentage increased by one percentage point our sales return reserve at december would increase by approximately million and corresponding revenue would decrease by the same amount conversely if the returns reserve percentage decreased by one percentage point our sales returns reserve at december would have decreased by approximately million and corresponding revenue would increase by the same amount we consider the sensitivity analysis of a one percentage point variance between estimated and actual returns reserve percentage to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in estimating our sales returns reserves for newly launched products we also defer the recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue for certain sales of inventory into the distribution channel that are in excess of eight weeks of projected demand the distribution channels market demand requirement is estimated based on inventory information reported to us by our major wholesale customers for which we have inventory management agreements who make up a significant majority of our total sales of inventory into the distribution channel no adjustment is made for those customers who do not provide inventory information to us deferred product revenue associated with estimated excess inventory at wholesalers was approximately million million and million as of december and respectively sales discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers as an incentive for prompt payment generally approximately of the sales price we account for cash discounts by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts expected to be taken by the customers we consider payment performance and adjust the allowance to reflect actual experience and our current expectations about future activity the provision for cash discounts was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for cash discounts increased million from million as of december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods was due to an increase in gross product sales the increase in the reserve for sales discounts during the year ended december was due to the increase in the related eligible outstanding accounts receivable amounts as of december as compared to december the provision for cash discounts was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for cash table of contents discounts increased million from million as of december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods was due to an increase in gross product sales the increase in the reserve for sales discounts during the year ended december was due to the increase in the related eligible outstanding accounts receivable amounts as of december as compared to december contract chargebacks we have agreements for contract pricing with several entities whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price these parties purchase products through wholesalers at the lower contract price and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contract price back to us we account for chargebacks by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable based on our estimate of chargeback claims attributable to a sale we determine our estimate of chargebacks based on historical experience and changes to current contract prices we also consider our claim processing lag time and adjust the allowance periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience although we record an allowance for estimated chargebacks at the time we record the sale typically when we ship the product the actual chargeback related to that sale is not processed until the entities purchase the product from the wholesaler we continually monitor our historical experience and current pricing trends to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated the provision for contract chargebacks was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for contract chargebacks increased million from million as of december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and the reserve during the year ended december was due to an increase in eligible gross product sales and in the number of pricing contracts in place during the comparable periods the provision for contract chargebacks was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for contract chargebacks increased million from million as of december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and the reserve during the year ended december was due to an increase in eligible gross product sales and in the number of pricing contracts in place during the comparable periods managed care and medicaid rebates managed care and medicaid rebates are contractual discounts offered to government programs and private health plans that are eligible for such discounts at the time prescriptions are dispensed subject to various conditions we record provisions for rebates based on factors such as timing and terms of plans under contract time to process rebates product pricing sales volumes amount of inventory in the distribution channel and prescription trends we continually monitor historical payment rates and actual claim data to ensure the liability is fairly stated the provision for managed care and medicaid rebates was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for managed care and medicaid rebates increased million from million as of december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and in the reserve during the year ended december was due to an increase in eligible gross product sales the provision for managed care and medicaid rebates was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for managed care and medicaid rebates increased million from million as of table of contents december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and in the reserve during the year ended december was due to an increase in eligible gross product sales and new managed care contracts entered into during december it is expected that the new managed care contracts entered into during december will result in managed care rebates being a greater percentage of gross sales of our products particularly solodynreg during as compared to consumer rebates and loyalty programs we offer consumer rebates on many of our products and we have consumer loyalty programs we generally account for these programs by establishing an accrual based on our estimate of the rebate and loyalty incentives attributable to a sale we generally base our estimates for the accrual of these items on historical experience and other relevant factors we adjust our accruals periodically throughout each quarter based on actual experience and changes in other factors if any to ensure the balance is fairly stated the provision for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for consumer rebates and loyalty programs increased million from million as of december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and in the reserve during the year ended december was primarily due to the continued growth in consumer rebate programs related to our solodynreg zianareg restylanereg and perlanereg products as well as the dysportreg challenge program that was in place during most of the provision for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million or of gross product sales and million or of gross product sales for the years ended december and respectively the reserve for consumer rebates and loyalty programs increased million from million as of december to million as of december the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and in the reserve during the year ended december was primarily due to the continued growth in consumer rebate programs related to our solodynreg zianareg restylanereg and perlanereg products if our estimates of rebate redemption rates or average rebate amounts for our consumer rebate programs changed by percent our reserve for consumer rebates would be impacted by approximately million and corresponding revenue would be impacted by the same amount we consider the sensitivity analysis of a percent variance in our estimated rebate redemption rates and average rebate amounts to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in estimating our reserve for consumer rebates use of information from external sources we use information from external sources to estimate our significant items deducted from gross revenues our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on inventory information reported to us by our major wholesale customers for which we have inventory management agreements historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled which we purchase from ims health inc one of the leading providers of prescription based information we regularly monitor internal data as well as external data from our wholesalers in order to assess the reasonableness of the information obtained from external sources we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products as well as our internal information regarding our products we use the information from ims health inc to project the prescription demand for our products our estimates are subject to inherent limitations pertaining to reliance on third party information as certain third party information is itself in the form of estimates table of contents use of estimates in reserves we believe that our allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances it is possible however that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues additionally changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our allowances and accruals to fluctuate particularly with newly launched products we review the rates and amounts in our allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in our recorded reserves the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease our reported net revenues conversely if actual returns rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in our recorded reserves the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase our reported net revenues if we changed our assumptions and estimates our related reserves would change which would impact the net revenues we report share based compensation in accordance with asc compensation stock compensation we are required to recognize the fair value of share based compensation awards as an expense determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options option pricing models including the black scholes model also require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility increasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have increased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share conversely decreasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share the expected life of the awards is based on historical experience of awards with similar characteristics stock option awards granted during have a stated term of years and the weighted average expected life of the awards was determined to be years decreasing the weighted average expected life by years from years to years would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts the fair value of our restricted stock grants is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant the fair value of stock appreciation rights sars is adjusted at the end of each reporting period based on updated valuation variables at the end of each reporting period the fair value of sars is most affected by changes in the fair market value of our common stock at the end of each reporting period we are required to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based compensation as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the first quarter of was immaterial we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what was recorded in the table of contents past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions our estimates of these important assumptions are based on historical data and judgment regarding market trends and factors if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors we may be required to record additional stock based compensation expense or income tax expense which could be material to our results of operations inventory inventory costs associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit if future commercial use and future economic benefit are not considered probable then costs associated with pre launch inventory that has not yet received regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense during the period the costs are incurred we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory if the probability of future commercial use and future economic benefit changes due to denial or delay of regulatory approval a delay in commercialization or other factors conversely our gross margins could be favorably impacted if previously expensed pre approval inventory becomes available and is used for commercial sale as of december there were no costs capitalized into inventory for products that have not yet received regulatory approval long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows if an asset carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows the asset is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset groupings carrying amount and its present value of anticipated net cash flows based on the best information available including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets we accelerate the rate of amortization charges in order to fully amortize the assets over their new shorter useful lives during and impairment charges of approximately million and million respectively were recognized related to our review of long lived assets this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a high degree of judgment if these assumptions change in the future we may be required to record additional impairment charges for and or accelerate amortization of long lived assets during we did not recognize an impairment charge as a result of our review of long lived assets if our estimates of future net revenues and gross profit margin for dysportreg were both reduced by percent our intangible asset related to dysportreg would be impaired by approximately million if only our estimates of future net revenues for dysportreg were reduced by percent and our estimates of gross profit margin for dysportreg were reduced by percent or less our intangible asset related to dysportreg would not be impaired similarly if only our estimates of gross profit margin for dysportreg were reduced by percent and our estimates of future net revenues for dysportreg were reduced by percent or less our intangible asset related to dysportreg would not be impaired we consider table of contents the sensitivity analysis of a percent variance in our future estimated net revenues and gross profit margin amounts to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in assessing the potential impairment of long lived assets income taxes income taxes are determined using an annual effective tax rate which generally differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily because of state and local income taxes enhanced charitable contribution deductions for inventory tax credits available in the us the treatment of certain share based payments that are not designed to normally result in tax deductions various expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and differences in tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate changes in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets reserves for tax audit issues and settlements utilization of tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations we recognize tax benefits only if the tax position is more likely than not of being sustained we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating losses and credit carryforwards we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying values to amounts that management believes is more likely than not to be realized based on our historical pre tax earnings we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of substantially all of the existing net deferred tax assets at december we believe the existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which we generate net taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future years certain tax planning or other strategies could be implemented if necessary to supplement income from operations to fully realize recorded tax benefits on november we closed our sale of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of liposonix to solta the transaction resulted in a million capital loss for income tax purposes of which million can be carried back and used to offset capital gains generated in prior tax years accordingly an income tax benefit of million was recognized and is included in the gain from discontinued operations for the year ended december a deferred tax asset was recorded on the portion of the capital loss million that could not be carried back to prior years as a capital loss can only be utilized to offset capital gains we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax asset in order to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to which is the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized the sales price used to calculate the above capital loss consisted of million of cash received at closing million of cash received on november and million of value from future additional contingent cash and milestone payments a deferred tax asset was recorded on the million as it was not recognized as additional selling price for financial reporting purposes we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against this deferred tax asset in order to reduce the carrying value of this deferred tax asset to which is the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we have an option to acquire revance or license revances topical product that is under development through december we have recorded million of charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of the revance investment the reduction in the carrying value of the revance investment is currently an unrealized loss for tax purposes we will not be able to determine the character of the loss until we exercise or fail to exercise our option a realized loss characterized as a capital loss can only be utilized to offset capital gains we have recorded a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this unrealized tax loss in order to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to which is the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized table of contents we have an option to acquire a privately held us biotechnology company through december we have an unrealized tax loss of million related to this option if we fail to exercise our option a capital loss will be recognized a loss characterized as a capital loss can only be used to offset capital gains we have recorded a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this unrealized tax loss in order to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to which is the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs including payments related to products under development and research consulting agreements are expensed as incurred we may continue to make non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and research and development work that has been completed these payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of the recognition of certain development costs in addition this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization for example when we acquire certain products for which there is already an anda or nda approval related directly to the product and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset in addition if we acquire product rights which are in the development phase and as to which we have no assurance that the third party will successfully complete its development milestones we expense such payments legal contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is estimable we disclose material contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts therefore actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain in addition to the matters disclosed in item legal proceedings of part i of this report we are party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business we do not expect the outcome of any pending litigation to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings recent accounting pronouncements in may the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards topic fair value measurement to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards asu no changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements asu no is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december and must be applied prospectively we are currently assessing what impact if any the revised guidance will have on our results of operations and financial condition in june the fasb issued asu no comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income the updated guidance amends the fasb accounting standards codification codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income the components of table of contents net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in both alternatives an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income asu no eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity the amendments to the codification in the asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income asu no will be applied retrospectively asu no is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december with early adoption permitted and will be applied retrospectively it is expected that the adoption of this amendment will only impact the presentation of comprehensive income within our consolidated financial statements in september the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment the updated guidance permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting units fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary the qualitative assessment is optional allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in annual reporting periods beginning after december with early adoption permitted we are currently assessing what impact if any the revised guidance will have on our results of operations and financial condition item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december million of our cash equivalent investments were in money market securities that are reflected as cash equivalents because all maturities are within days included in money market securities are commercial paper federal agency discount notes and money market funds our interest rate risk with respect to these investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned which approximate current interest rates our policy for our short term and long term investments is to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal meets liquidity needs avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an available for sale basis was approximately million as of december and million as of december these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase as of december our investments included auction rate floating securities with a fair value of million our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions the negative conditions in the credit markets from through have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings including their holdings of auction rate floating securities as a result these affected auction rate floating securities are now considered illiquid and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity we may not be able to liquidate the securities until a future auction on these investments is successful table of contents the following table provides information about our available for sale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well are our contingent convertible senior notes which have fixed interest rates we have aggregated our available for sale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollar amounts in thousands interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity as of december financial instruments mature during year ended december thereafter available for sale and trading securities weighted average yield rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate we have not entered into derivative financial instruments we have minimal operations outside of the us and accordingly we have not been susceptible to significant risk from changes in foreign currencies during the normal course of business we could be subjected to a variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations as we discussed above and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
