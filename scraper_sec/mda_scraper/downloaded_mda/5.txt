ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL In recent years, the Company has undergone an extensive restructuring of its operations with the objective of improving its competitive position within the durable medical equipment industry. The restructuring was designed to reduce costs and the eliminate excess manufacturing capacity. Asset sales were undertaken to generate cash to partially finance restructuring activities and reduce debt levels. Credit facilities were modified or expanded as needed to partially fund the overall restructuring, in addition to contributing to the funding of the Companys operations. In early 1992 the Company announced its intention to consolidate its domestic wheelchair manufacturing operations and corporate headquarters by relocating its California based manufacturing and corporate offices to Missouri by the end of 1992. This decision was made to further reduce costs through the consolidation of administrative and support functions with existing operations in Missouri. The relocation from California was begun in the second quarter of 1992, and, except for data processing operations, was largely completed by the end of 1992. In October, 1993, the Company transferred its data processing operations from California to Missouri, which represented the final step in the Companys relocation. As a result of the relocation, the Company experienced major start up problems in wheelchair production and manufacturing delays and inefficiencies attributable generally to the commencement of relocated manufacturing operations and specifically to the need to train a large number of new employees. These start up problems impacted most severely the Companys high margin rehab wheelchair products, and the resulting reduction in sales and cash flow hindered the Companys ability to keep vendor payments current and to otherwise implement corrective measures quickly and effectively. Shipment delays caused a substantial build up in back ordered power and rehab wheelchair products in the second half of 1992 and the first half of 1993, which the Company reduced over time. Customer confidence and frustration resulting from such delays combined to increase the order cancellation rate and to decrease the incoming order rate, particularly for the affected wheelchairs. As a result, orders and market share decreased, and manufacturing activity generally shifted disproportionately to lower margin commodity wheelchairs. Incoming orders, product backlog and timely shipments were improved during the second half of 1993, with continued improvement during 1994 and 1995. However, the Company believes order rates, margins and market share must continue to improve and customer confidence must be further restored and reinforced if the Company is to generate the cash flow necessary to fund its operations on a continuing basis and to achieve profitability. Additionally, certain production rationalizations are in process relative to the Companys manufacturing facilities in the US, Canada and Mexico, which are designed to improve the Companys operating efficiencies and cost structure by reducing duplicate overhead costs. Production and delivery of all of the Companys homecare bed products were unaffected by the production problems that occurred in the relocation of the wheelchair manufacturing facility to St. Louis. The Company has continued to deliver homecare bed products in a timely manner and management believes that market share can be maintained in these product lines. The sale of the Institutional Business has not adversely affected homecare bed sales. Effective in the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of Smith & Davis hospital and nursing home bed and institutional casegoods businesses (the "Institutional Business") and recorded a reserve of $13 million to write down the assets of the Institutional Business to their estimated net realizable values and for the estimated operating losses during the phase out period and the estimated costs of disposition. See Note 2 Restructuring Expenses, and Note 4 Assets Held for Sale, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. By Agreement dated February 15, 1995, the Company sold the Institutional Business effective April 4, 1995. In the domestic market, the Companys durable medical equipment products are sold primarily through homecare and medical equipment dealers, as well as national accounts. Consumers and dealers are reimbursed through federal, state and private insurer reimbursement programs. The Company recognizes the need to counteract the impact of cutbacks in such programs on its results of operations and cash flow through the benefits of a reduced cost structure and by targeting new market segments. During fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company required approximately $2.6 million (net), $13.7 million and $45.8 million, respectively, of additional financing from BIL to fund its operating requirements and accrued restructuring expenses, and the amount of outstanding advances owing to BIL at December 31, 1995 totaled $21.1 million (see Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion and Note 7 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K). In 1994, based on predominant industry practice, the Company changed its method of classification of shipping and distribution costs in the statement of operations. Such costs are now presented in cost of sales versus operating expenses in prior years. For purposes of the following discussion of results of operations, affected amounts for all years have been reclassified to conform to the current years classification. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Substantially all of the Companys revenues for each of the three years ended December 31, 1995 were from products manufactured in North America. 1995 versus 1994 Revenues in 1995 decreased $4.8 million, or 6%, versus 1994, primarily due to increased price competition related to the increased market penetration of managed care organizations and price constraints established by the US Government for Medicare reimbursement. Wheelchair sales were adversely affected by competition as the Companys competitors attempted to maximize market share. Lower homecare bed revenues reflect the impact of increased price competition. 1994 versus 1993 Revenues in 1994 declined $15 million, or 16% versus 1993, due primarily to the exclusion of the Institutional Business. Revenues of the Institutional Business and related costs were included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company in 1993 but not 1994 or 1995, as the related assets were classified as held for sale at December 31, 1993, and the 1994 and 1995 results of operations were aggregated and charged against accrued restructuring expenses for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. If the 1994 revenues of the Institutional Business ($21.2 million) had been included in the Consolidated results for 1994, revenues would have been increased by $6.2 million or 7%. 1993 wheelchair sales and operations were negatively impacted by the relocation of the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility from California to Missouri. Delivery delays caused by the 1992 move have decreased and lead times have now been brought more in line with historical levels. Operating Results For the periods indicated, the following table summarizes operating results of the Company (dollars in millions): Year Ended December31, 1995 1994 1993 Amount % Amount % Amount % Revenues $74.6 100 $79.4 100 $94.5 100 Cost of sales 58.6 79 65.8 83 83.8 89 Gross profit 16.0 21 13.6 17 10.7 11 Operating expenses 17.6 23 20.8 26 46.0 48 Operating loss before restructuring expenses (1.6) (2) (7.3) (9) (35.3) (37) Restructuring expenses 15.1 16 Operating loss (1.6) (2) (7.3) (9) (50.4) (53) Interest expense, BIL (1.7) (2) (0.9) (1) (2.6) (3) Interest expense, other (2.1) (3) (1.7) (2) (2.5) (3) Loss before income taxes (5.4) (7) (9.9)(12) (55.5) (59) Income tax provisions (benefits) 0.1 (0.1) .2 Net loss $(5.5) (7) $(9.8)(12) $(55.7) (59) 1995 versus 1994 1995 revenues decreased $4.8 million or 6% to $74.6 million from $79.4 million in 1994. Wheelchair and accessory sales of $59.7 million in 1995 decreased $4.0 million or 6% from 1994. Price pressure brought on by competition, managed care and government cutbacks negatively impacted domestic sales. The decrease is due primarily to discounting in the marketplace. Sales of Smith & Davis homecare beds in 1995 increased $1.1 million or 12% from 1994. 1995 sales of Smith & Davis oxygen concentrators and other products decreased $1.9 million as this product line was discontinued and sold in August 1995. Total Company gross profit increased $2.4 million or 18% from $13.6 million in 1994 to $16.0 million in 1995. The increase in gross profit reflects improved manufacturing efficiency and positive results of the Companys program to outsource manufacturing to lower cost facilities, offset in part by continued price competition in the markets for the Companys wheelchairs and bed products. Productivity at the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility was negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of 1995 as a result of a WARN act notice issued pursuant to the layoff of 30% of the work force at that facility. These layoffs, which were completed during the first quarter of 1996, were a result of the transfer of workload to lower cost facilities and the Companys continued manufacturing rationalization. Operating expenses decreased $3.2 million from $20.8 million in 1994 to $17.6 million in 1995. This decrease is primarily due to continued cost containment and favorable changes in insurance rates and claims. Interest expense increased to $3.8 million in 1995 from $2.6 million in 1994 due to increased borrowings during 1995. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes, and Note 7 Debt, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 1994 versus 1993 Wheelchair and accessory sales of $65.7 million in 1994 increased $3.9 million or 6% from 1993. The 1992 relocation of the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility from California to Missouri and the related production and delivery problems negatively affected sales during 1993. Shipments during 1993 were further negatively impacted by complications arising out of a major computer system implementation which occurred in October, 1993. The majority of the problems associated with the computer system conversion have since been rectified. The domestic wheelchair order rate demonstrated improvement throughout 1994 as operations in Missouri stabilized. Sales of Smith & Davis homecare beds of $10.7 million in 1994 decreased $0.7 million or 6% from 1993 due primarily to increased competition and price erosion. Sales of the Institutional Business for 1993 approximated $17 million. This business was not included in the Companys consolidated results of operations for 1994 or 1995, as discussed above. Total Company gross profit increased $2.9 million or 27% from $10.7 million in 1993 to $13.6 million in 1994. The increase in gross profit reflected manufacturing efficiencies experienced in the wheelchair operations as operations stabilized subsequent to the 1992 relocation of wheelchair manufacturing to Missouri. Gross profit was adversely affected during the fourth quarter of 1994 by a $3.0 million charge to reserves for product liability, workers compensation claims and inventory cost adjustments. As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased from 11% in 1993 to 17% in 1994. Operating expenses decreased $25.2 million from $46.0 million in 1993 to $20.8 million in 1994. This decrease is primarily due to a $9.7 million charge relating to in process research and development expenses (selling expenses) recorded during 1993 pursuant to the Companys acquisition of Medical Composite Technology, Inc., a $2.0 million charge recorded during 1993 for anticipated costs of environmental remediation, and a $2.4 million charge recorded during 1993 for severance obligations and other cost reductions implemented during 1994. Additionally, during 1994 $1.7 million was charged to restructuring reserves relating to General and Administrative expenses allocated to the Institutional Business. Restructuring expenses recorded during 1993 of $15.1 million primarily relate to losses anticipated on the disposition of the Companys Institutional Business. Interest expense decreased to $2.6 million in 1994 from $5.1 million in 1993 due primarily to the fourth quarter 1993 conversion of $75 million of debt and accrued interest to equity. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash provided from operations and borrowings. At December 31, 1995, the Company had $0.1 million in cash or $0.4 million less than the $0.5 million in cash at December 31, 1994. At December 31, 1995, total debt of $47.9 million was $5.3 million higher than the $42.6 million in debt at December 31, 1994. The debt conversion transaction in 1993 resulted in conversion of $75 million of indebtedness and accrued interest to $55 million of Common Stock and $20 million of Series C Preferred Stock. Prior to such debt conversion transaction, the indebtedness had increased during 1993 due to advances from BIL in the amount of $37.8 million, which were used to fund operating losses and previously accrued restructuring expenses and to repay $5.7 million to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited Chicago Branch ("HSBC"). During 1994 and 1995 BIL advanced the Company an additional $13.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively, which was used to fund operating losses and previously accrued restructuring expenses. In December 1995, HSBC and E&J Inc. agreed to amend the Revolving Credit Agreement originally entered into on September 30, 1992 and extend its term through September, 1997. The HSBC facility, as amended, provides up to $6 million of letter of credit availability and cash advances of up to $25 million to E&J Inc. Advances under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at the prime rate plus 0.25%, as announced by Marine Midland Bank N.A., from time to time, and are guaranteed by Brierley Investments Limited, an affiliate of BIL. Repayment of existing debt with BIL is subordinated to the HSBC debt. On December 21, 1995, $3 million of the increased credit facility was utilized to repay an advance from BIL made earlier in 1995. As of December 31, 1995, $18.7 million of the $25 million available for cash advances from HSBC had been utilized. At December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, under the debt agreements with BIL and HSBC, the Company was obligated to repay the following amounts at the various dates listed below. 12/31/95 12/31/94 Balance Balance Debt Agreement $ millions $ millions Repayment Date Revolving Promissory 21.1 18.5 Revolving Promissory Note Note to BIL matures September 30, 1997 HSBC Revolving Credit 18.7 10.0 September 30, 1997 Agreement (1) Accrued, unpaid 2.6 1.0 interest due BIL TOTAL $42.4 $29.5 (1)Excludes approximately $5.7 million and $5.1 million committed with respect to outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively. There can be no assurance that the Companys operation will produce positive cash flow in sufficient amounts so that the Company will be able to secure additional borrowings or make asset sales that will enable it to make its debt payments when due. The Company entered into a debt conversion agreement as of September 30, 1993 with BIL whereby $75 million of the indebtedness due BIL was restructured by the issuance of a Common Stock Note and a Preferred Stock Note. The balance of the BIL indebtedness ($6.8 million) which was not converted into the Common Stock Note and the Preferred Stock Note was treated as advances under the the Companys revolving promissory note with BIL. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the debt conversion transaction. BIL agreed, upon stockholder approval of the debt conversion transaction and related recapitalization proposals, to advance to E&J Inc. an additional $10 million. Such advance by BIL to E&J Inc. resulted in an increase in the principal amount of the Common Stock Note from $45 million to $55 million and a decrease in the balance of BILs revolving promissory note to $4.8 million effective as of December 31, 1993. As part of the debt conversion transaction, BIL agreed to provide to the Company and E&J Inc. a revolving credit facility of up to $12.5 million, as evidenced by BILs revolving promissory note. As of December 31, 1995, this facility was completely utilized and an additional $8.6 million, net, had been advanced to the Company and E&J Inc. by BIL. BIL has agreed to extend the due date of such debt to September 30, 1997. In July, 1991, the Company obtained a three year $13 million secured credit line for its Smith & Davis subsidiary which is secured by substantially all of the subsidiarys assets. In February, 1993 this credit line was amended to increase the availability of funding to the Company and reduce the borrowing costs thereunder. The cash proceeds from the sale of the Institutional Business of approximately $4.5 million were used to reduce this debt. The balance due under this credit line was repaid in December 1995 utilizing funds advanced from BIL. The Companys Canadian subsidiary has existing credit facilities in the aggregate of $4.7 million, of which $4.7 million was borrowed as of December 31, 1995. During June, 1994 the Companys Mexican subsidiary obtained a credit facility in the aggregate of $1.0 million, on which $0.7 million was borrowed as of December 31, 1995. Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 15, 1995, the Company sold the Smith & Davis Institutional Business effective April 4, 1995. The proceeds consisted of approximately $4.5 million in cash (which was used to repay debt), $2.7 million in assumption of liabilities, and notes valued at approximately $2.1 million; $0.2 million of such notes were repaid in 1995 with the remainder expected to be repaid in 1996. At December 31, 1995 the Company owed $24.7 million to banks and other commercial lenders, $2.1 million under capitalized lease obligations, and $21.1 million to BIL. The Companys 1995 and 1994 revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by ongoing price competition. Long lead times and shipping delays due to start up inefficiencies in the wheelchair manufacturing operations adversely impacted customer confidence. Management continues to address the Companys problems with manufacturing and shipment delays. Additionally, the Company continues to address the rationalization of its production facilities in the US, Canada and Mexico and the increased outsourcing of products and product components, which the Company expects will lower its production costs. Order rates, margins and market share must increase, production and operating costs must be further reduced and customer confidence must continue to be restored if the Company is to generate the cash flow necessary to fund its debt service and operations on a continuing basis and to achieve profitability. Although the Company has programs in place which are designed to address these issues, there is no assurance that such programs will achieve their objectives. With respect to its wheelchair and homecare bed products, the Company anticipates severe price and product competition for the foreseeable future. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the going concern concept. The going concern concept anticipates an entity will continue in its present form and, accordingly, uses the historical cost basis to prepare financial statements. The Company has incurred substantial restructuring expenses and recurring operating losses and has a net capital deficiency at December 31, 1995. No assurance can be made that the Company will successfully emerge from or complete its restructuring activities. Management believes that the Companys domestic and international manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet anticipated demand for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 million are projected for 1996 versus actual expenditures of $0.8 million in 1995. The Mexican peso has resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the Companys Mexico subsidiary. No dividends on the Companys Common Stock were paid in either 1995 or 1994. Management does not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. The determination of future cash dividends to be declared and paid on the Common Stock, if any, will depend upon the Companys financial condition, earnings and cash flow from operations, the level of its capital expenditures, its future business prospects and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Company is currently prohibited from paying cash dividends on its Common Stock under covenants contained in the debt agreements with its principal lenders. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards The Company and certain subsidiaries file consolidated federal income and combined state tax returns. For federal income tax purposes, as of December 31, 1995, the Company has net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $143 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1 million that expire in 1997 through 2010. In accordance with the Internal Revenue Code, when certain changes in company ownership occur, utilization of NOL carryforwards is limited. The Company has determined that there has been a change in ownership due to the various debt and equity transactions consummated with BIL as described in Note 7 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, approximately $88.5 million of the Companys NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $3 million. If the full amount of that limitation is not used in any year, the amount not used increases the allowable limit in the subsequent year. In addition, there are approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, of preacquisition NOL carryforwards generated by Smith & Davis and MCT with expiration dates through 2004. Annual utilization of these NOLs is limited to $0.6 million for Smith & Davis and $0.5 million for MCT to reduce each entitys future contribution to consolidated taxable income.

Production and delivery of all of the Companys homecare bed products were unaffected by the production problems that occurred in the relocation of the wheelchair manufacturing facility to St. Louis. The Company has continued to deliver homecare bed products in a timely manner and management believes that market share can be maintained in these product lines. The sale of the Institutional Business has not adversely affected homecare bed sales. Effective in the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of Smith & Davis hospital and nursing home bed and institutional casegoods businesses (the "Institutional Business") and recorded a reserve of $13 million to write down the assets of the Institutional Business to their estimated net realizable values and for the estimated operating losses during the phase out period and the estimated costs of disposition. See Note 2 Restructuring Expenses, and Note 4 Assets Held for Sale, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. By Agreement dated February 15, 1995, the Company sold the Institutional Business effective April 4, 1995. In the domestic market, the Companys durable medical equipment products are sold primarily through homecare and medical equipment dealers, as well as national accounts. Consumers and dealers are reimbursed through federal, state and private insurer reimbursement programs. The Company recognizes the need to counteract the impact of cutbacks in such programs on its results of operations and cash flow through the benefits of a reduced cost structure and by targeting new market segments. During fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company required approximately $2.6 million (net), $13.7 million and $45.8 million, respectively, of additional financing from BIL to fund its operating requirements and accrued restructuring expenses, and the amount of outstanding advances owing to BIL at December 31, 1995 totaled $21.1 million (see Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion and Note 7 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K). In 1994, based on predominant industry practice, the Company changed its method of classification of shipping and distribution costs in the statement of operations. Such costs are now presented in cost of sales versus operating expenses in prior years. For purposes of the following discussion of results of operations, affected amounts for all years have been reclassified to conform to the current years classification. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Substantially all of the Companys revenues for each of the three years ended December 31, 1995 were from products manufactured in North America. 1995 versus 1994 Revenues in 1995 decreased $4.8 million, or 6%, versus 1994, primarily due to increased price competition related to the increased market penetration of managed care organizations and price constraints established by the US Government for Medicare reimbursement. Wheelchair sales were adversely affected by competition as the Companys competitors attempted to maximize market share. Lower homecare bed revenues reflect the impact of increased price competition. 1994 versus 1993 Revenues in 1994 declined $15 million, or 16% versus 1993, due primarily to the exclusion of the Institutional Business. Revenues of the Institutional Business and related costs were included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company in 1993 but not 1994 or 1995, as the related assets were classified as held for sale at December 31, 1993, and the 1994 and 1995 results of operations were aggregated and charged against accrued restructuring expenses for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. If the 1994 revenues of the Institutional Business ($21.2 million) had been included in the Consolidated results for 1994, revenues would have been increased by $6.2 million or 7%. 1993 wheelchair sales and operations were negatively impacted by the relocation of the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility from California to Missouri. Delivery delays caused by the 1992 move have decreased and lead times have now been brought more in line with historical levels. Operating Results For the periods indicated, the following table summarizes operating results of the Company (dollars in millions): Year Ended December31, 1995 1994 1993 Amount % Amount % Amount % Revenues $74.6 100 $79.4 100 $94.5 100 Cost of sales 58.6 79 65.8 83 83.8 89 Gross profit 16.0 21 13.6 17 10.7 11 Operating expenses 17.6 23 20.8 26 46.0 48 Operating loss before restructuring expenses (1.6) (2) (7.3) (9) (35.3) (37) Restructuring expenses 15.1 16 Operating loss (1.6) (2) (7.3) (9) (50.4) (53) Interest expense, BIL (1.7) (2) (0.9) (1) (2.6) (3) Interest expense, other (2.1) (3) (1.7) (2) (2.5) (3) Loss before income taxes (5.4) (7) (9.9)(12) (55.5) (59) Income tax provisions (benefits) 0.1 (0.1) .2 Net loss $(5.5) (7) $(9.8)(12) $(55.7) (59) 1995 versus 1994 1995 revenues decreased $4.8 million or 6% to $74.6 million from $79.4 million in 1994. Wheelchair and accessory sales of $59.7 million in 1995 decreased $4.0 million or 6% from 1994. Price pressure brought on by competition, managed care and government cutbacks negatively impacted domestic sales. The decrease is due primarily to discounting in the marketplace. Sales of Smith & Davis homecare beds in 1995 increased $1.1 million or 12% from 1994. 1995 sales of Smith & Davis oxygen concentrators and other products decreased $1.9 million as this product line was discontinued and sold in August 1995. Total Company gross profit increased $2.4 million or 18% from $13.6 million in 1994 to $16.0 million in 1995. The increase in gross profit reflects improved manufacturing efficiency and positive results of the Companys program to outsource manufacturing to lower cost facilities, offset in part by continued price competition in the markets for the Companys wheelchairs and bed products. Productivity at the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility was negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of 1995 as a result of a WARN act notice issued pursuant to the layoff of 30% of the work force at that facility. These layoffs, which were completed during the first quarter of 1996, were a result of the transfer of workload to lower cost facilities and the Companys continued manufacturing rationalization. Operating expenses decreased $3.2 million from $20.8 million in 1994 to $17.6 million in 1995. This decrease is primarily due to continued cost containment and favorable changes in insurance rates and claims. Interest expense increased to $3.8 million in 1995 from $2.6 million in 1994 due to increased borrowings during 1995. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes, and Note 7 Debt, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 1994 versus 1993 Wheelchair and accessory sales of $65.7 million in 1994 increased $3.9 million or 6% from 1993. The 1992 relocation of the Companys primary domestic manufacturing facility from California to Missouri and the related production and delivery problems negatively affected sales during 1993. Shipments during 1993 were further negatively impacted by complications arising out of a major computer system implementation which occurred in October, 1993. The majority of the problems associated with the computer system conversion have since been rectified. The domestic wheelchair order rate demonstrated improvement throughout 1994 as operations in Missouri stabilized. Sales of Smith & Davis homecare beds of $10.7 million in 1994 decreased $0.7 million or 6% from 1993 due primarily to increased competition and price erosion. Sales of the Institutional Business for 1993 approximated $17 million. This business was not included in the Companys consolidated results of operations for 1994 or 1995, as discussed above. Total Company gross profit increased $2.9 million or 27% from $10.7 million in 1993 to $13.6 million in 1994. The increase in gross profit reflected manufacturing efficiencies experienced in the wheelchair operations as operations stabilized subsequent to the 1992 relocation of wheelchair manufacturing to Missouri. Gross profit was adversely affected during the fourth quarter of 1994 by a $3.0 million charge to reserves for product liability, workers compensation claims and inventory cost adjustments. As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased from 11% in 1993 to 17% in 1994. Operating expenses decreased $25.2 million from $46.0 million in 1993 to $20.8 million in 1994. This decrease is primarily due to a $9.7 million charge relating to in process research and development expenses (selling expenses) recorded during 1993 pursuant to the Companys acquisition of Medical Composite Technology, Inc., a $2.0 million charge recorded during 1993 for anticipated costs of environmental remediation, and a $2.4 million charge recorded during 1993 for severance obligations and other cost reductions implemented during 1994. Additionally, during 1994 $1.7 million was charged to restructuring reserves relating to General and Administrative expenses allocated to the Institutional Business. Restructuring expenses recorded during 1993 of $15.1 million primarily relate to losses anticipated on the disposition of the Companys Institutional Business. Interest expense decreased to $2.6 million in 1994 from $5.1 million in 1993 due primarily to the fourth quarter 1993 conversion of $75 million of debt and accrued interest to equity. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash provided from operations and borrowings. At December 31, 1995, the Company had $0.1 million in cash or $0.4 million less than the $0.5 million in cash at December 31, 1994. At December 31, 1995, total debt of $47.9 million was $5.3 million higher than the $42.6 million in debt at December 31, 1994. The debt conversion transaction in 1993 resulted in conversion of $75 million of indebtedness and accrued interest to $55 million of Common Stock and $20 million of Series C Preferred Stock. Prior to such debt conversion transaction, the indebtedness had increased during 1993 due to advances from BIL in the amount of $37.8 million, which were used to fund operating losses and previously accrued restructuring expenses and to repay $5.7 million to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited Chicago Branch ("HSBC"). During 1994 and 1995 BIL advanced the Company an additional $13.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively, which was used to fund operating losses and previously accrued restructuring expenses. In December 1995, HSBC and E&J Inc. agreed to amend the Revolving Credit Agreement originally entered into on September 30, 1992 and extend its term through September, 1997. The HSBC facility, as amended, provides up to $6 million of letter of credit availability and cash advances of up to $25 million to E&J Inc. Advances under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at the prime rate plus 0.25%, as announced by Marine Midland Bank N.A., from time to time, and are guaranteed by Brierley Investments Limited, an affiliate of BIL. Repayment of existing debt with BIL is subordinated to the HSBC debt. On December 21, 1995, $3 million of the increased credit facility was utilized to repay an advance from BIL made earlier in 1995. As of December 31, 1995, $18.7 million of the $25 million available for cash advances from HSBC had been utilized. At December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, under the debt agreements with BIL and HSBC, the Company was obligated to repay the following amounts at the various dates listed below. 12/31/95 12/31/94 Balance Balance Debt Agreement $ millions $ millions Repayment Date Revolving Promissory 21.1 18.5 Revolving Promissory Note Note to BIL matures September 30, 1997 HSBC Revolving Credit 18.7 10.0 September 30, 1997 Agreement (1) Accrued, unpaid 2.6 1.0 interest due BIL TOTAL $42.4 $29.5 (1)Excludes approximately $5.7 million and $5.1 million committed with respect to outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively. There can be no assurance that the Companys operation will produce positive cash flow in sufficient amounts so that the Company will be able to secure additional borrowings or make asset sales that will enable it to make its debt payments when due. The Company entered into a debt conversion agreement as of September 30, 1993 with BIL whereby $75 million of the indebtedness due BIL was restructured by the issuance of a Common Stock Note and a Preferred Stock Note. The balance of the BIL indebtedness ($6.8 million) which was not converted into the Common Stock Note and the Preferred Stock Note was treated as advances under the the Companys revolving promissory note with BIL. See Note 6 Debt Restructuring and Conversion, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the debt conversion transaction. BIL agreed, upon stockholder approval of the debt conversion transaction and related recapitalization proposals, to advance to E&J Inc. an additional $10 million. Such advance by BIL to E&J Inc. resulted in an increase in the principal amount of the Common Stock Note from $45 million to $55 million and a decrease in the balance of BILs revolving promissory note to $4.8 million effective as of December 31, 1993. As part of the debt conversion transaction, BIL agreed to provide to the Company and E&J Inc. a revolving credit facility of up to $12.5 million, as evidenced by BILs revolving promissory note. As of December 31, 1995, this facility was completely utilized and an additional $8.6 million, net, had been advanced to the Company and E&J Inc. by BIL. BIL has agreed to extend the due date of such debt to September 30, 1997. In July, 1991, the Company obtained a three year $13 million secured credit line for its Smith & Davis subsidiary which is secured by substantially all of the subsidiarys assets. In February, 1993 this credit line was amended to increase the availability of funding to the Company and reduce the borrowing costs thereunder. The cash proceeds from the sale of the Institutional Business of approximately $4.5 million were used to reduce this debt. The balance due under this credit line was repaid in December 1995 utilizing funds advanced from BIL. The Companys Canadian subsidiary has existing credit facilities in the aggregate of $4.7 million, of which $4.7 million was borrowed as of December 31, 1995. During June, 1994 the Companys Mexican subsidiary obtained a credit facility in the aggregate of $1.0 million, on which $0.7 million was borrowed as of December 31, 1995. Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 15, 1995, the Company sold the Smith & Davis Institutional Business effective April 4, 1995. The proceeds consisted of approximately $4.5 million in cash (which was used to repay debt), $2.7 million in assumption of liabilities, and notes valued at approximately $2.1 million; $0.2 million of such notes were repaid in 1995 with the remainder expected to be repaid in 1996. At December 31, 1995 the Company owed $24.7 million to banks and other commercial lenders, $2.1 million under capitalized lease obligations, and $21.1 million to BIL. The Companys 1995 and 1994 revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by ongoing price competition. Long lead times and shipping delays due to start up inefficiencies in the wheelchair manufacturing operations adversely impacted customer confidence. Management continues to address the Companys problems with manufacturing and shipment delays. Additionally, the Company continues to address the rationalization of its production facilities in the US, Canada and Mexico and the increased outsourcing of products and product components, which the Company expects will lower its production costs. Order rates, margins and market share must increase, production and operating costs must be further reduced and customer confidence must continue to be restored if the Company is to generate the cash flow necessary to fund its debt service and operations on a continuing basis and to achieve profitability. Although the Company has programs in place which are designed to address these issues, there is no assurance that such programs will achieve their objectives. With respect to its wheelchair and homecare bed products, the Company anticipates severe price and product competition for the foreseeable future. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the going concern concept. The going concern concept anticipates an entity will continue in its present form and, accordingly, uses the historical cost basis to prepare financial statements. The Company has incurred substantial restructuring expenses and recurring operating losses and has a net capital deficiency at December 31, 1995. No assurance can be made that the Company will successfully emerge from or complete its restructuring activities. Management believes that the Companys domestic and international manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet anticipated demand for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 million are projected for 1996 versus actual expenditures of $0.8 million in 1995. The Mexican peso has resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the Companys Mexico subsidiary. No dividends on the Companys Common Stock were paid in either 1995 or 1994. Management does not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. The determination of future cash dividends to be declared and paid on the Common Stock, if any, will depend upon the Companys financial condition, earnings and cash flow from operations, the level of its capital expenditures, its future business prospects and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Company is currently prohibited from paying cash dividends on its Common Stock under covenants contained in the debt agreements with its principal lenders. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards The Company and certain subsidiaries file consolidated federal income and combined state tax returns. For federal income tax purposes, as of December 31, 1995, the Company has net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $143 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1 million that expire in 1997 through 2010. In accordance with the Internal Revenue Code, when certain changes in company ownership occur, utilization of NOL carryforwards is limited. The Company has determined that there has been a change in ownership due to the various debt and equity transactions consummated with BIL as described in Note 7 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, approximately $88.5 million of the Companys NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $3 million. If the full amount of that limitation is not used in any year, the amount not used increases the allowable limit in the subsequent year. In addition, there are approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, of preacquisition NOL carryforwards generated by Smith & Davis and MCT with expiration dates through 2004. Annual utilization of these NOLs is limited to $0.6 million for Smith & Davis and $0.5 million for MCT to reduce each entitys future contribution to consolidated taxable income.
