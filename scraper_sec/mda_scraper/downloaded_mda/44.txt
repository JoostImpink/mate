Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion relates to the three fiscal years ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. As disclosed in greater detail elsewhere in this report, we commenced mining operations and began to receive operating revenues in August 2007, shortly after the end of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2007. (the financial data in this discussion is in thousands, except where otherwise specifically noted). We utilize certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios in managing the business. We believe these measures may provide users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Non GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies use "Cash costs per ounce sold" is a non GAAP measure which includes all direct mining costs, refining and transportation costs and by product credits as well as royalties as reported in the Companys financial statements. Total cost per ounce sold is a non GAAP measure which includes cash costs per ounce sold as well as depreciation and amortization as reported in the Companys financial statements. Overview You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Our financial position was as follows: As of As of July 31, 2010 July 31, 2009 Total debt $ 4,400 $ 8,000 Total stockholders equity $ 50,929 $ 35,765 Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,125 $ 6,448 Working capital $ 31,857 $ 20,646 During our fiscal year ended July 31, 2010 our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net cash provided from operations of $14,731; Capital expenditures of $6,515; 42 Repayments on Credit Facility of $3,600; Proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercising of warrants of $565; Looking Forward Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following (the financial data in this discussion is in thousands except for ounces and cash cost data): Fluctuations in gold prices; We expect fiscal 2011 gold sales of approximately 65,000 to 70,000 ounces; Cash costs per ounce sold for fiscal 2011 are expected to be approximately $485 per ounce; We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $12,500 in fiscal 2011 with approximately $7,200 being allocated to leach pad expansion, approximately $1,500 for the addition of agglomeration equipment, $750 in property interest payments; and $600 for additional conveyors; Repayments on Credit Facility of $3,600 during fiscal 2011. Our fiscal year 2011 expectations, particularly with respect to sales volumes and cash costs per ounce sold, may differ significantly from actual quarter and full fiscal year results due to variations in: ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removed, commodity input prices, foreign currencies and gold sale prices. Result of Operations Fiscal year ended July 31, 2010 compared to the year ended July 31, 2009 Net income for the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $11,994 and $10,407, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $1,587 or 15% over the prior period. Income before taxes was $24,019 and $15,949 for the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which represented an increase of 51%. Income before taxes increased primarily as a result of higher revenues from a higher gold price being realized on ounces sold during the current period as well as higher production results during the year ended July 31, 2010, as compared to the same period a year ago. As a result of management changes during the year ended July 31, 2010, we incurred severance related charges to executives and employees of approximately $2,710 within general and administrative expense. If we exclude these charges, net income for the year ended July 31, 2010 would have been approximately $14,704 representing an increase of approximately $4,297 or 41% over the prior period. Revenues & Costs Applicable to Sales Gold sales for the year ended July 31, 2010 totaled approximately $60,645 as compared to $42,757 in the prior period representing an increase of approximately $17,888 or 42%. We sold 54,304 ounces at an average realizable price per ounce of approximately $1,117 in the current period. We sold 48,418 ounces at an average realizable price per ounce of $883 during the same period last year. 43 Costs applicable to sales were approximately $22,017 and $13,883, respectively, for the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009, an increase of approximately $8,134 or 59%. Cash costs were $391 per ounce of gold sold for the year ended July 31, 2010 as compared to $271 for the year ended July 31, 2009. The primary reasons for this increase in cash cost per ounce sold in the current period were attributable to: An increase in mining costs of approximately $4,764 or 55% over the prior period. This was primarily due to higher mining contractor costs of approximately $2,637 compared to the prior period primarily due to an increase in tonnage mined of 3,216,468 tonnes or 39%, higher diesel fuel consumption of $1,156 due to an increase in tonnage mined and longer haul distance as the pit deepens, and higher explosive costs of $750 due to the increase in tonnage mined as well as a change in the type of explosive utilized by the mine; Higher crushing costs of approximately of $946, an increase of 36% over the prior period, mainly due to an increase in maintenance and the usage of crusher parts and supplies. This increase was attributable to the addition of our new secondary and tertiary crusher in May and December 2009, respectively, which increased tonnage going through the circuit by 13% or 516,000 tonnes as compared to the prior year. In addition, labor costs rose as a result of the hiring of additional crusher operators. An increase in leaching and ADR plant costs of approximately $1,975 or 37% mainly due to an increase in consumption of certain chemicals ($1,209) as well as consumption and price increase in cost of lime ($352) in the processing of ore as well as an increase in both water ($103) and electricity ($137) usage (the increased consumption was mainly the result of increasing the chemical concentration and solution flow to the leach pad as we increased the level of lifts or height of the leach pad as well as the surface area under leach with the additional leach pad. Higher heavy equipment maintenance costs of approximately $559 or 53% over the same period in the prior year. This was primarily due to an increase in repair and maintenance costs associated with our three trucks and two loaders. The additional tonnage moved in the current year as well as higher repairs and maintenance costs experienced with the procurement of used equipment has factored into the increase as compared to the prior year. Total costs were $444 per ounce of gold sold for the year ended July 31, 2010 as compared to $314 total cost per ounce sold in the prior period. The primary reason for this increase in total costs can be attributable to the reasons detailed above as well as the increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from capital expenditures during the current period. Revenues from by product sales, which consist of silver, are credited to Costs applicable to sales as a by product credit. By product sales amounted to $1,400 and $1,076 for the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009, on silver ounces sold of 80,941 and 86,523, respectively. 44 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $2,939 and $2,041, respectively, an increase of $898 or 44%. The primary reason for the increase in the current period was attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization charges related to property, plant and equipment additions. General and Administration Expense General and administrative expenses during the year ended July 31, 2010 were approximately $8,573, an increase of approximately $3,109, or 57%, from the year ended July 31, 2009. This increase resulted primarily from one time severance related charges to executives and employees of approximately $2,710. In addition, we experienced higher legal and professional fees associated with merger and acquisition activity including our acquisition with Nayarit Gold of approximately $996. Exploration Expense Exploration expense during the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $1,616 and $1,600, respectively, or a increase of $16, or 1%. Both periods presented include activity associated with on going exploration, drilling and geochemical work being conducted on our leased and owned concessions located northwest of Saric, Sonora as well as on going drilling at our El Chanate mine. Other Income and Expense Our loss on the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009, was approximately $0 and $1,975, respectively, and was reflected as Other Expense. The primary reason for the decrease can be attributed to the close out, on February 24, 2009, with Standard Bank, Plc., of the remaining 58,233 ounces of gold hedged under the original Gold Price Protection arrangements originally entered into in March 2006. Interest expense was approximately $1,365 for the year ended July 31, 2010 compared to approximately $1,575 for the same period a year earlier. This decrease was due to lower interest charges incurred during the current period, based on a lower average debt balance compared to the prior period offset by cost of interest rate swaps. As of July 31, 2010 and 2009, there was $4,400 and $8,000, respectively, outstanding on our term note with Standard Bank. Interest expense also includes amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the credit arrangements entered into with Standard Bank. This accounted for approximately $993 and $978 of amortization expense during the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $12,025 during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2010, compared to $5,542 in 2009 with an effective tax rate of 50% and 35%, respectively. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate are operating losses generated by the Companys U.S. parent for which no benefit has been recognized. Current year income tax expense and deferred income tax expense amounted to $8,062 and $3,963 as of July 31, 2010, respectively. Prior year income tax expense and deferred income tax expense amounted to $3,909 and $1,633 as of July 31, 2009, respectively. 45 Mining operations are primarily conducted in Mexico. Mexico has tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. On October 1, 2007, the Mexican Government enacted legislation which introduces certain tax reforms as well as a new minimum flat tax system, which was effective for tax year 2008. This flat tax system integrates with the regular income tax system and is based on cash basis net income that includes only certain receipts and expenditures. The flat tax is set at 17.5% of cash basis net income for tax year 2010, which increased from 17% for tax year 2009. If the flat tax is positive, it is reduced by the regular income tax and any excess is paid as a supplement to the regular income tax. For the tax year 2010, the Mexican Government introduced a reform where if the flat tax is negative, companies will not be permitted to reduce the income tax, as it may only serve to reduce the regular flat tax payable in that year or can be carried forward for a period of up to ten years to reduce any future flat tax. On January 1, 2010, the Mexican government enacted legislation, which increases the regular income tax rate from 28% to 30%. The regular income tax rate will decrease to 29% in 2013 and then back to 28% in 2014, according to legislation. Companies are required to prepay income taxes on a monthly basis based on the greater of the flat tax or regular income tax as calculated for each monthly period. There is the possibility of implementation amendments by the Mexican Government and the estimated future income tax liability recorded at the balance sheet date may change. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. In accordance with ASC guidance for income taxes, the measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits, which are, on a more likely than not basis, not expected to be realized. Net deferred tax assets related to the U.S. operations have been fully reserved. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. For more information concerning income taxes, please see Note 22 within the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates During the years ended July 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded equity adjustments from foreign currency translations of approximately $1,463 and $(8,355), respectively. These translation adjustments are related to changes in the rates of exchange between the Mexican Peso and the U.S. dollar and are included as a component of other comprehensive income. The Mexican Peso and the U.S. dollar exchange rate as of July 31, 2010 was 12.7012. As of July 31, 2009, such exchange rate was 12.9933. 46 Summary of Annual Results (000s except per share Data and ounces sold) For the year For the year For the year ended ended ended July 31, 2010 July 31, 2009 July 31, 2008 Revenues 60,645 42,757 33,104 Net Income 11,994 10,407 6,364 Basic net income per share 0.25 0.22 0.15 Diluted net income per share 0.25 0.21 0.13 Gold ounces sold 54,304 48,418 39,102 Average price received $ 1,117 $ 883 $ 847 Cash cost per ounce sold(1) $ 391 $ 271 $ 276 Total cost per ounce sold(1) $ 444 $ 314 $ 335 (1) "Cash costs per ounce sold" is a Non GAAP measure, which includes all direct mining costs, refining and transportation costs, by product credits and royalties as reported in the Companys financial statements divided by ounces sold during the applicable period.

Summary of Results of Operations For the year ended For the year ended For the year ended July 31, 2010 July 31, 2009 July 31, 2008 Tonnes of ore mined 4,586,875 3,847,883 3,498,612 Tonnes of waste removed 6,797,425 4,319,949 2,627,318 Ratio of waste to ore 1.48 1.12 0.75 Tonnes of ore processed 4,515,152 3,999,346 3,529,699 Grade (grams/tonne) 0.74 0.78 0.85 Gold (ounces) Produced(3) 55,746 49,921 39,242 Sold 54,304 48,418 39,102 (3)Gold produced each year does not necessarily correspond to gold sold during the year, as there is a time delay in the actual sale of the gold. 47 Fiscal year ended July 31, 2009 compared to fiscal year ended July 31, 2008 Net income for the years ended July 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $10,407 and $6,364, respectively, representing an increase of approximately 64% over the prior period. Net income before income taxes was $15,949 and $9,871 for the years ended July 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which represented an increase of 62%. Net income and net income before taxes increased primarily as a result of higher revenues from more ounces of gold being sold during the year ended July 31, 2009, as compared to the same period a year ago. Income tax expense increased in conjunction with the increase in net income before tax, which was anticipated. Revenues & Costs Applicable to Sales Gold sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2009 totaled approximately $42,757 as compared to $33,104 in the prior period representing an increase of approximately $9,653 or 29%. We sold 48,418 ounces at an average realizable price per ounce of approximately $883 in the current period. We sold 39,102 ounces at an average realizable price per ounce of $847 during the same period last year. Costs applicable to sales were approximately $13,883 and $10,690, respectively, for the year ended July 31, 2009 and 2008, an increase of approximately $3,193 or 30%, which increased in conjunction with our increase in revenues. Cash costs of $271 per ounce of gold sold for the year ended July 31, 2009 was 2% lower than the $276 for the year ended July 31, 2008. The primary reason for this decrease in cash costs in the current year can be attributed to the 10% net profit interest paid to Royal Gold which was primarily incurred in the prior fiscal year. This was offset by a higher waste to ore strip ratio of 1.12 to 1 experienced during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2009 as compared to the prior fiscal year of 0.75 to 1. Our increased production profile in the current fiscal year advanced the removal of more waste tonnes than in the prior year. Total costs of $314 per ounce of gold sold for the year ended July 31, 2009, was 6% lower than the $335 total cost in the prior period. The primary reason for this decrease in total costs was attributed to higher amortization charges recorded in the prior period related to the repurchase of the 5% net profit interest acquired from FG in 2006 for $500. Revenues from by product sales, which consist of silver, are credited to Costs applicable to sales as a by product credit. By product sales amounted to $1,076 and $707 for the year ended July 31, 2009 and 2008, on silver ounces sold of 86,523 and 40,461, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended July 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $2,041 and $2,350, respectively. The primary reason for the decrease of approximately $309, or 13%, was due to amortization charges recorded in the prior period related to the repurchase of the 5% net profit interest acquired from FG in 2006 for $500. The $500 was fully amortized during the quarterly period ended April 30, 2008. This was slightly offset by an increase in Units of Production depreciation and amortization mainly attributable to additional ounces being produced in the current period versus the same period in the prior year. 48 General and Administration Expense General and administrative expenses during the year ended July 31, 2009 were approximately $5,464, a decrease of approximately $122, or 2%, from the year ended July 31, 2008. The decrease in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from: 1) lower salaries and wages primarily due to a decrease in cash bonuses of approximately $345 during the current fiscal year compared to the prior year, 2) lower equity based compensation of approximately $93 as compared to the prior year, 3) lower investor relations and travel expenses of approximately $87. Offsetting these decreases were higher legal and financial advisor fees incurred as a result of merger and acquisition activity during the current year as well as higher audit fees associated with the attestation report issued on the effectiveness of our internal controls during the current period. Exploration Expense Exploration expense during the year ended July 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $1,600 and $938, respectively, or an increase of $662, or 71%. The primary reason for the increase can be attributed to increased activity during the current period associated with on going exploration, drilling and geochemical work being conducted on our leased and owned concessions located northwest of Saric, Sonora. Exploration expense for the current period also included costs incurred from a 10 hole, deep core drilling campaign at our El Chanate mine totaling 2,500 meters. Exploration expense in the prior period included a drilling campaign initiated in December 2007 at El Chanate which consisted of 26 reverse circulation holes amounting to 4,912 meters. These drill holes were mainly positioned to test the outer limits of the currently known ore zones within the pit. Other Income and Expense Our loss on the change in fair value of derivative instruments during the year ended July 31, 2009 and 2008, was approximately $1,975 and $1,356, respectively, and was reflected as Other Expense. The primary reason for the increase can be attributed to the settlement, on February 24, 2009, with Standard Bank, Plc., the remaining 58,233 ounces of gold under the original Gold Price Protection arrangements entered into in March 2006. The purpose of these arrangements at the time was to protect us in the event the gold price dropped below $500 per ounce. Total remuneration to unwind these arrangements was approximately $1,906. In conjunction with the settlement of the gold price protection agreements, we incurred an Other Expense of approximately $1,391 during the current period. These contracts were not designated as hedging derivatives; and therefore, special hedge accounting does not apply. Interest expense was approximately $1,575 for the year ended July 31, 2009 compared to approximately $2,295 for the same period a year earlier. This decrease was mainly due to lower interest charges incurred during the current period related to our credit arrangements with Standard Bank. As of July 31, 2009, there was $8,000 outstanding on our term note. Interest expense also includes deferred financing costs resulting from the credit arrangements entered into with Standard Bank. This accounted for approximately $978 and $1,088 of depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended July 31, 2009 and 2008. 49 Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $5,542 during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2009, compared to $3,507 in 2008 with an effective tax rate of 35% and 35%, respectively. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate are valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets offset partially by lower statutory tax rates in Mexico. Current year income tax expense and deferred income tax expense amounted to $3,909 and $1,633 as of July 31, 2009, respectively. Prior year income tax expense and deferred income tax expense amounted to $2,111 and $1,396 as of July 31, 2008, respectively. Mining operations are primarily conducted in Mexico. Mexico has tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. On October 1, 2007, the Mexican government enacted legislation which introduced certain tax reforms as well as a new minimum flat tax system. This new flat tax system integrates with the regular income tax system and is based on cash basis net income that includes only certain receipts and expenditures. The flat tax is set at 17.5% of cash basis net income as determined, with transitional rates of 16.5% and 17.0% in 2008 and 2009, respectively. If the flat tax is positive, it is reduced by the regular income tax and any excess is paid as a supplement to the regular income tax. If the flat tax is negative, it may serve to reduce the regular income tax payable in that year or can be carried forward for a period of up to ten years to reduce any future flat tax. Companies are required to prepay income taxes on a monthly basis based on the greater of the flat tax or regular income tax as calculated for each monthly period. Annualized income projections indicate that we will not be liable for any excess flat tax for calendar year 2009 and, accordingly, have recorded a Mexican income tax provision as of July 31, 2009. As the new legislation was recently enacted, it remains subject to ongoing varying interpretations. There is the possibility of implementation amendments by the Mexican government and the estimated future income tax liability recorded at the balance sheet date may change. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. In accordance with ASC guidance for income taxes, the measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits, which, on a more likely than not basis, are not expected to be realized. Net deferred tax assets related to the U.S. operations have been fully reserved. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2009 and 2008, we completed a reconciliation of our U.S. book and tax basis assets and liabilities as well as a detailed analysis of our income taxes payable. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. For more information concerning income taxes, please see Note 22 within the consolidated financial statements contained herein. 50 Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates During the years ended July 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded equity adjustments from foreign currency translations of approximately $(8,355) and $2,504, respectively. These translation adjustments are related to changes in the rates of exchange between the Mexican Peso and the U.S. dollar and are included as a component of other comprehensive income. The Mexican Peso and the U.S. dollar exchange rate as of July 31, 2009 was 12.9933 to 1. As of July 31, 2008, such exchange rate was 10.0483 to 1. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended July 31, 2010 and 2009 was $14,731 and $7,536, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities increased $7,195 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2009, primarily due to higher net income resulting from an increase in the average gold price received for ounces sold , an increase in the change in inventory balances between periods of $5,537, and an increase in accrued expenses of $4,447 mainly due to the accruals associated with one time severance related charges to executives and employees as well as an increase in our income tax accrual during the year ended July 31, 2010. In addition, on January 25, 2010, we entered into a Collateral Agreement (the Collateral Agreement) with Metal Recovery Solutions, LLC (MRS), a privately held Nevada company, in which it was proposed that we would acquire twenty five percent of all of the issued and outstanding equity of MRS for aggregate investment of $2,000. The Collateral Agreement required us to promptly pay $500 to MRS, with the intention to invest the remaining $1,500 set forth in a letter of intent (the LOI) entered into on January 25, 2010, the material terms of which were non binding. Our obligation to invest the remaining $1,500 was contingent upon the execution of a definitive Investment Agreement (the Investment Agreement). Because the Investment Agreement was not consummated, the Collateral Agreement provides that the $500 payment to MRS would be repaid with interest (the MRS Repayment). Such repayment is secured by cash flows from MRSs Consulting / Services Agreement with a third party gold mining company, the expected value of which is $1,275 to MRS. On March 25, 2010, we elected not to pursue the implementation of the MRS technology at the El Chanate mine. Accordingly, we demanded repayment of the amounts paid to MRS in accordance with the letter agreement between MRS and us. On May 12, 2010, the parties agreed to reduce the MRS Repayment to $450 and we are currently receiving repayment based on the original Collateral Agreement. We recorded the remaining receivable amount of $210 as of July 31, 2010 as an Other Current Asset. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during the year ended July 31, 2010, amounted to approximately $6,515, primarily for the acquisition of an additional tertiary crusher and screen plant, additional water rights, additional leach pad expansion, as well as new platform upgrades for three of our crushers. 51 In May 2010, we initiated the planning and permitting on the construction of an additional leach pad to the east of the existing leach pads. The total capacity of this additional leach pad will be approximately 8.5 million tonnes (when stacked to six lifts) and cost approximately $7,500. This pad will be expanded on the south, east and possibly west sides to accommodate the current ore reserve. When combined with the original and west pads the aggregate capacity will be approximately 20.1 million tonnes. This capital expenditure is anticipated to be expended over the next twelve months. Site clearing was initiated in May 2010 and construction commenced in July 2010. The first panel is anticipated to be ready for stacking towards the end of the calendar year with complete construction anticipated to be completed by May 2011. In July 2010, the Company commenced the use of belt agglomeration with cement which is added to the crushed ore at the El Chanate mine to improve the flow of leaching solution. We have engaged an independent consultant with respect to heap leaching optimization, which has resulted in recommendations to increase the barren solution flow to the leach pad, increase the pregnant solution flow to the recovery plant, and redirect the low grade solution to the leach pads. When implemented, these operational changes combined with the agglomeration with cement and barren solution may result in immediate improvements in leaching time. We ordered two agglomeration drums which are expected to arrive by January 2011. The current belt agglomeration is a temporary measure until the drums are delivered. The use of agglomeration drums will allow for better mixing of cement and lime with the crushed ore, producing a consistent quality control of the product. The cost of these agglomeration drums and an additional overland conveyor is anticipated to be $2,000. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended July 31, 2009, amounted to approximately $5,174, primarily from the acquisition of an additional secondary crusher and tunnel conveyor, mobile equipment, conveyors and ADR plant equipment, including the carbon regeneration kiln. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2010 amounted to approximately $3,148, primarily from the repayment of our term loan of $3,600. We also received proceeds of approximately $565 in the current period from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of 31,250 options and 150,000 warrants. In addition, we paid $113 in finance costs to amend our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Standard Bank (See Term loan and Revolving Credit Facility section below). Cash used in financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2009 amounted to approximately $4,175, primarily from the repayment of the term loan of $4,500. Business Combination Agreements On October 1, 2010, the Company and Gammon Gold Inc. (Gammon Gold) entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Gammon Gold offered to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Capital Gold in a cash and share transaction (the Gammon Transaction). The total consideration for the purchase of 100% of the fully diluted shares of Capital Gold is approximately US$288 million or US$4.57 per Capital Gold share based on Gammon Golds closing price on September 24, 2010 on the NYSE. The Gammon Transaction has the unanimous support of both companies Boards of Directors and Officers. Under the terms of the Gammon Transaction, each common share of Capital Gold will be exchanged for 0.5209 common shares of Gammon Gold and a cash payment in the amount of US$0.79 per share. Based on the September 24, 2010 closing price of Capital Golds shares on the NYSE EURONEXT, the acquisition price represents a 20% premium to the close on September 24th and a 30% premium to the 20 day volume weighted average price on the NYSE EURONEXT ending on that date. The consummation of the Gammon Transaction is subject to numerous contingencies as described in the related merger agreement including, but not limited to, Capital Gold stockholder approval. 52 On August 2, 2010, the Company acquired Nayarit Gold, Inc. (Nayarit). As a result of the Business Combination, Nayarit became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Business Combination, each outstanding share of Nayarit common stock was converted into 0.134048 shares of Capital Gold common stock, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional share. Capital Gold issued 12,454,354 shares of its common stock in the Business Combination to Nayarits current stockholders and has reserved for issuance an additional 1,621,981 and 903,483 shares of Capital Gold common stock upon the exercise of former Nayarit warrants and options, respectively. Based on the number of outstanding shares of Nayarit common stock and Capital Gold common stock, after the consummation of the Business Combination, the stockholders of Nayarit own approximately 20.4% of Capital Gold on a non diluted basis. Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on August 2, 2010, the consideration received by Nayarit shareholders had a value of approximately $47.6 million as detailed below. Conversion Calculation Estimated Fair Value Form of Consideration (In thousands, except per share amounts) Number of Nayarit shares outstanding as of the Amalgamation date 92,910 Exchange ratio(1) 0.134048 Number of shares issued to Nayarit shareholders 12,454 Value of Capital Gold common shares issued(1) $ 3.71 $ 46,206 Capital Gold Common stock Value of Nayarits options and warrants to be exchanged for Capital Gold options and warrants (2) 1,393 Capital Gold Options and Warrants Total consideration transferred $ 47,599 (1) In accordance with ASC 805, the fair value of equity securities issued as part of the consideration transferred was the closing market price of Capital Golds common stock on the effective date of the Amalgamation. The pro forma shares issued was 12,454,354 common shares, which is calculated by multiplying 0.134048 by 92,909,659, being the number of shares of Nayarit common stock outstanding on August 2, 2010. Nayarit shareholders own approximately 20.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Gold common stock. (2) Represents the fair value to acquire 1,621,981 and 903,483 shares of Capital Gold common stock upon the exercise of former Nayarit warrants and options, respectively. The fair value of the warrants and options were estimated using the Black Scholes valuation model utilizing the assumptions noted below. Stock price $3.71 Post conversion strike price $3.28 $9.92 Average expected volatility 70% Dividend yield None Average risk free interest rate 0.29% Average contractual term .79 years Black Scholes average value per warrant and option $0.57 53 The expected volatility of Capital Golds stock price is based on the average historical volatility which is based on daily observations and duration consistent with the expected life assumption and implied volatility. The average contractual term of the warrants and options is based on the remaining contractual exercise term of each warrant and option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. treasury securities with maturities equal to the expected life of the warrants and options The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of major assets acquired and liabilities assumed on August 2, 2010: Fair Value(in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 50 Short term investments 2 Prepaid expenses and sundry receivables 1,238 Property, plant and equipment 196 Mineral interests indicated and inferred 43,822 Exploration interests 3,627 Accounts payable and liabilities assumed (1,336) Net assets acquired $ 47,599 A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Companys judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Companys results from operations. The Companys management allocated the acquisition cost to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of Nayarits tangible and identifiable assets and liabilities. The amount allocated to the mineral and exploration interests was based on a valuation report prepared by a third party appraisal firm. The allocation is not considered final as of the date of this report as management is still reviewing certain of the underlying assumptions and calculations used in the allocation to the assets and liabilities of Nayarit that were acquired. However, the Company believes the final purchase price allocation will not be materially different than presented herein. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, the Company incurred transaction costs consisting primarily of legal, professional, investment advisory and accounting fees of $2.4 million. These costs are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Pro forma Information The following unaudited pro forma results of operations of the Company for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2010 and 2009 assume that the acquisition of the operating assets of the significant businesses acquired during 2010 and 2009 had occurred on August 1 of the respective year in which the business was acquired and for the comparable period only (i.e., 2010 acquisitions are reflected in 2009). These unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of either the actual results of operations that would have been achieved had the companies been combined during these periods, or are they necessarily indicative of future results of operations. 54 (in thousands) Year Ended July 31, 2010 Year Ended July 31, 2009 Revenues $ 60,645 $ 42,757 Net income (loss) $ 10,905 $ 2,270 Income (loss) per common share: Basic net income (loss) $ 0.18 $ 0.04 Diluted net income (loss) $ 0.18 $ 0.03 2010 Pro forma Results Twelve Months Ended July 31, 2010 The 2010 pro forma results were calculated by combining the results of Capital Gold with the stand alone historical results of Nayarit Gold for the year ended June 30, 2010. The elimination of $2.4 million in transaction related costs were made which would have been incurred during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 had the acquisition commenced on August 1, 2009. Term loan and Revolving Credit Facility In September 2008, we closed an Amended And Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) involving our wholly owned Mexican subsidiaries MSR and Oro, as borrowers (Borrowers), us, as guarantor, and Standard Bank PLC (Standard Bank), as the lender. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the prior credit agreement between the parties dated August 15, 2006. Under the Credit Agreement, MSR and Oro borrowed money in an aggregate principal amount of up to $12,500 (the Term Loan) for the purpose of constructing, developing and operating the El Chanate gold mining project in Sonora State, Mexico. We guaranteed the repayment of the Term Loan and the performance of the obligations under the Credit Agreement. As of July 31, 2010, the outstanding amount on the term note was $4,400 and accrued interest on this agreement was approximately $11. Term Loan principal shall be repaid quarterly and commenced on September 30, 2008 and consisted of four payments in the amount of $1,125, followed by eight payments in the amount of $900 and two final payments in the amount of $400. There is no prepayment fee. Principal under the Term Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBO Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, for the applicable Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin. An Interest Period can be one, two, three or six months, at the option of the Borrowers. The Applicable Margin for the Term Loan is 2.5% per annum. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, operating accounts remain subject to an account pledge agreement between MSR and Standard Bank. The Loan is secured by all of the tangible and intangible assets and property owned by MSR and Oro. As additional collateral for the Loan, the Company, together with its subsidiary, Leadville Mining & Milling Holding Corporation, pledged all of its ownership interest in MSR and Oro. On September 17, 2009, our $5,000 revolving loan contained within the Credit Agreement expired. The Company had not drawn on this facility during the term period. 55 On June 30, 2010, Capital Gold Corporation (Capital Gold or the Company) entered into the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amendment) by and among the Borrowers (as defined above), the Company, as guarantor, and Standard Bank, as the lender. The Amendment amends the Credit Agreement the parties entered into on September 18, 2008 with retroactive effect from July 17, 2008, which amended and restated the Credit Agreement between the parties dated August 15, 2006. The Credit Agreement provided for a senior secured term credit facility in the aggregate amount of $12,500 (the Term Facility) and provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000 (the Revolving Facility). Capital Gold guarantees all obligations of the Borrowers under the Term Facility and the Revolving Facility. The material amendments to the Credit Agreement contained in the Amendment are as follows: The Amendment increases the Revolving Facility to $7,500. The Revolving Facility is available for a two year period commencing June 30, 2010. The Borrowers may request a borrowing of the Revolving Facility from time to time, provided that each borrowing shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $500. All amounts due under the Revolving Facility, including all accrued interest and other amounts described in the Credit Agreement, shall be due and payable on June 30, 2012. Amounts borrowed under the Term Facility and the Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBO Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, for the applicable interest period plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for the Revolving Facility was increased in the Amendment to 3.0% per annum. The Borrowers are to use the proceeds of the Revolving Facility to fund general corporate and working capital requirements in connection with the El Chanate gold mining project and the Saric gold exploration project. The Amendment increased the Tangible Net Worth (as defined in the Credit Agreement) requirement to at least U.S.$30,000 and requires Capital Gold to maintain at all times a Ratio of Debt to Cash Flow from Operations, as defined in the Amendment, of no greater than 2.50:1.00. Debt Covenants Capital Golds Credit Agreement with Standard Bank requires it, among other obligations, to meet certain financial covenants including, but not limited to, (i) a ratio of current assets to current liabilities at all times greater than or equal to 1.20:1.00, (ii) a quarterly minimum tangible net worth at all times of at least U.S. $30,000, (iii) maintain a ratio of debt to cash flow from operations of no greater than 2:50:1:00, and (iv) a quarterly average minimum liquidity of U.S. $500. In addition, the Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, Capital Golds ability to incur additional debt, create liens on its property, dispose of any assets, merge with other companies, enter into hedge agreements, organize or invest in subsidiaries or make any investments above a certain dollar limit. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement could lead to an event of default thereunder which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. As a condition to closing the Nayarit Business Combination, Capital Gold obtained the consent of Standard Bank. As of July 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and default provisions. 56 Environmental and Permitting Issues Management does not expect that environmental issues will have an adverse material effect on our liquidity or earnings. The Company complies with all laws, rules and regulations concerning mining, environmental, health, zoning and historical preservation issues and we are not aware of any environmental issues or reclamation issues at the El Chanate concessions. We have received the required Mexican government permits for operations. Any revisions to our mine plan may require us to amend the permits. We received the annual extension to the explosive use permit from the relevant authorities. The permit is valid through December 2010. We include environmental and reclamation costs on an ongoing basis, in our revenue and cost projections. No assurance can be given that environmental regulations will not be revised by the Mexican authorities in the future. As of July 31, 2010, we have estimated the reclamation costs for the El Chanate site to be approximately $4,094 if we had to reclaim the property as of that date. Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and closure costs. The asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance and activity to date will occur. We review, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the asset retirement obligation for the mine site. We reviewed the estimated present value of the El Chanate mine reclamation and closure costs as of July 31, 2010 primarily due to the addition of the new leach pad in accordance with ASC guidance for asset retirement and environmental obligations. As of July 31, 2010, our reclamation and remediation liability was $2,373. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of July 31, 2010 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations(5)(6) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Debt (1) $ 4,537 $ 3,712 $ 825 $ $ Remediation and reclamation obligations(2) 4,094 4,094 Operating leases(3) 522 261 261 Derivative instruments(4) 40 40 $ 9,193 $ 4,013 $ 1,086 $ $ 4,094 (1) Amounts represent principal ($4,400) and estimated interest payments ($137) assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these remediation and reclamation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding remediation and reclamation liabilities, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Amounts represent a non cancelable operating lease for office space in New York that commenced on September 1, 2007 and terminates on August 31, 2012. In addition to base rent, the lease calls for payment of utilities and other occupancy costs. Also, includes an operating lease for office space in Caborca, Sonora, operating lease for office space in Hermosillo, Sonora, as well as leased concessions in Saric, Sonora for exploration. (4) Amounts represent the net cash settlement of interest rate swap agreement with Standard Bank. (5) Contractual obligations do not include the net smelter return payments as this payment is linked to the gold price and cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. As of July 31, 2010, the amount remaining in net smelter return payments due to Royal Gold was approximately $11,451. (6) Contractual obligations do not include Nayarits contractual concession payments for the exploration rights of La Estrella of (i) $100 in December 8, 2010, (ii) $100 in June 8, 2011, (iii) $175 in December 8, 2011, (iv) $175 in June 8, 2012, (v) $350 in December 8, 2012 or the concession payment for the exploration rights of the Huajicari concessions of $250 due by October 31, 2010. 57 While we believe that our available funds in conjunction with anticipated revenues from metal sales will be adequate to cover our cash requirements for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2011, if we encounter unexpected problems we may need to raise additional capital. We also may need to raise additional capital for significant property acquisitions and or exploration activities. To the extent that we need to obtain additional capital, management may raise such funds through the sale of our securities, obtain debt financing, and or joint venturing with one or more strategic partners. We cannot assure that adequate additional funding, if needed, will be available or on terms acceptable to us. If we need additional capital and we are unable to obtain it from outside sources, we may be forced to reduce or curtail our operations or our anticipated exploration activities. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 15. Financial Statements below. Disclosure About Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that constitute off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include inventory, revenue recognition, property, plant and mine development, impairment of long lived assets, accounting for equity based compensation, environmental remediation costs, accounting for derivative and hedging activities, income taxes and use of estimates. Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories (In Process Inventory) Costs that are incurred in or benefit the productive process are accumulated as ore on leach pads and inventories. Ore on leach pads and inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market. The current portion of ore on leach pads and inventories is determined based on the amounts to be processed within the next 12 months. The major classifications are as follows: Ore on Leach Pads The recovery of gold from ore is achieved through the heap leaching process. Under this method, ore is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical solution, which dissolves the gold contained in the ore. The resulting pregnant solution is further processed in a processing plant that extracts gold from this solution producing gold dore. Costs are applied to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation, depletion and amortization relating to the mining operation. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad. 58 The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tonnes added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on fire assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type and column testwork). It is estimated that the Companys leach pad at El Chanate will recover all ounces placed within a one year period from date of placement. Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process needs to be constantly monitored and estimates need to be refined based on actual results over time. The Companys operating results may be impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. In process Inventory In process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the specific processing facility, but include leach in circuit, flotation and column cells and carbon in pulp inventories. In process material are measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of the respective plants. In process inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines and or leach pads plus the in process conversion costs, including applicable depreciation relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process. Precious Metals Inventory Precious metals inventories include gold dor and or gold bullion. Precious metals that result from the Companys mining and processing activities are valued at the average cost of the respective in process inventories incurred prior to the refining process, plus applicable refining costs. Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and freight. Property, Plant and Mine Development Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated productive lives, which do not exceed the related estimated mine lives, of such facilities based on proven and probable reserves. 59 Mineral exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, costs incurred prospectively to develop the property will be capitalized as incurred and are amortized using the units of production (UOP) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels and operating costs of production and capital, all based on life of mine plans. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on managements relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. Our estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels and operating costs of production and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Reclamation and Remediation Costs (Asset Retirement Obligations) Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and closure costs. The asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance and activity to date will occur. We review, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the asset retirement obligation at our mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs which were included in other assets relate to costs incurred in connection with bank borrowings and are amortized over the term of the related borrowings. Intangible Assets Purchased intangible assets consisting of rights of way, easements, net profit interests, etc. are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight line method over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally five years or using the units of production method. It is our policy to assess periodically the carrying amount of our purchased intangible assets to determine if there has been an impairment to their carrying value. Impairments of intangible assets are determined in accordance with ASC guidance for intangibles. There was no impairment at July 31, 2010. 60 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, loans receivable, accrued expenses and accounts payable approximated fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Companys accounts receivable balance approximates fair value. The carrying value of the Companys long term debt approximates fair value due to the variable nature of its interest rate. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized from the sale of gold dor when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is determinable, the product has been shipped to the refinery, the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured from the customer. The Company sells its precious metal content to a financial institution. Revenues are determined by selling the precious metal content at the spot price. Sales are calculated based upon assay of the dors precious metal content and its weight. The Company sells approximately 95% of the precious metal content contained within the dor from the refinery based upon the preliminary assay of the Company. The residual ounces are sold upon obtaining the final assay and settlement for the shipment. The Company forwards an irrevocable transfer letter to the refinery to authorize the transfer of the precious metal content to the customer. The sale is recorded by the Company upon the refinery pledging the precious metal content to the customer. The Company waits until the dor precious metal content is pledged to the customer at the refinery to recognize the sale because collectability is not ensured until the dor precious metal content is pledged. The sale price is not subject to change subsequent to the initial revenue recognition date. Revenues from by product sales, which consist of silver, are credited to Costs applicable to sales as a by product credit. By product sales amounted to $1,400, $1,076 and $707 for the years ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, on silver ounces sold of 80,941, 86,523 and 40,461, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of the Companys Mexican subsidiaries are translated to US dollars using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities. Amounts on the statement of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the year. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) which is reported on the accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of accumulated foreign translation gains and losses, the fair value change in our interest rate swap agreement and net unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. 61 Income Taxes On October 1, 2007, the Mexican Government enacted legislation which introduces certain tax reforms as well as a new minimum flat tax system, which was effective for tax year 2008. This new flat tax system integrates with the regular income tax system and is based on cash basis net income that includes only certain receipts and expenditures. The flat tax is set at 17.5% of cash basis net income for tax year 2010, which increased from 17% for tax year 2009. If the flat tax is positive, it is reduced by the regular income tax and any excess is paid as a supplement to the regular income tax. For the tax year 2010, the Mexican Government introduced a reform where if the flat tax is negative, companies will not be permitted to reduce the income tax, as it may only serve to reduce the regular flat tax payable in that year or can be carried forward for a period of up to ten years to reduce any future flat tax. On January 1, 2010, the Mexican government enacted legislation, which increases the regular income tax rate from 28% to 30%. The regular income tax rate will decrease to 29% in 2013 and then back to 28% in 2014, according to legislation. Companies are required to prepay income taxes on a monthly basis based on the greater of the flat tax or regular income tax as calculated for each monthly period. This legislation remains subject to ongoing varying interpretations. There is the possibility of implementation amendments by the Mexican government and the estimated future income tax liability recorded at the balance sheet date may change. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. In accordance with ASC guidance for income taxes, the measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits, which are, on a more likely than not basis, not expected to be realized. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. Equity Based Compensation In connection with offers of employment to our executives as well as in consideration for agreements with certain consultants, we issue options and warrants to acquire our common stock. Employee and non employee awards are made in the discretion of the Board of Directors. We account for stock compensation under ASC guidance for compensation stock compensation, which requires the Company to expense the cost of employees services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. This expense must be recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities On October 11, 2006, prior to our initial draw on the Credit Agreement, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, which requires that we hedge at least 50% of our outstanding debt under this agreement. The agreements entered into cover $9,375 or 75% of the outstanding debt. Both swaps covered this same notional amount of $9,375, but over different time horizons. The first covered the six months that commenced on October 11, 2006 and terminated on March 31, 2007 and the second covers the period from March 30, 2007 through December 31, 2010. We intend to use discretion in managing this risk as market conditions vary over time, allowing for the possibility of adjusting the degree of hedge coverage as we deem appropriate. However, any use of interest rate derivatives will be restricted to use for risk management purposes. 62 We used variable rate debt to finance a portion of the El Chanate Project. Variable rate debt obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. As a result of these arrangements, we will continuously monitor changes in interest rate exposures and evaluate hedging opportunities. Our risk management policy permits us to use any combination of interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and similar instruments, for the purpose of fixing interest rates on all or a portion of variable rate debt, establishing caps or maximum effective interest rates, or otherwise constraining interest expenses to minimize the variability of these effects. The interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby effective hedge gains or losses are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and later reclassified to the interest expense component of earnings coincidently with the earnings impact of the interest expenses being hedged. Ineffective hedge results are immediately recorded in earnings also under interest expense. No component of hedge results is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to these interest rate swap agreements, but we do not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, we select counterparties based on credit ratings, limit our exposure to a single counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitor the market position with each counterparty as required by ASC guidance for derivatives and hedging. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Metal Price Changes in the market price of gold significantly affects our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and global mine production levels. Foreign Currency Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic conditions. Most of our assets and operations are in Mexico; therefore, we are more susceptible to fluctuations in the Mexican peso / U.S. dollar exchange. Our Mexico operations sell their metal production based on a U.S. dollar gold price as is the general, world wide convention. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Mexican peso that impacts our cost structure was not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, then profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and managements long term view of the applicable exchange rate. We believe, however, that this exchange rate variability has not had a material impact on our financial statements. 63 Gold Price Protection Agreement On February 24, 2009, we settled with Standard Bank, the remaining 58,233 ounces of gold under the original Gold Price Protection arrangements entered into in March 2006. The purpose of these arrangements at the time was to protect the Company in the event the gold price dropped below $500 per ounce. Total remuneration to unwind these arrangements was approximately $1,906. Interest Rate Swap Contracts On October 11, 2006, prior to our initial draw on the Credit Agreement, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. Although the Credit Facility requires that we hedge at least 50% of our outstanding debt under this facility, we elected to cover $9,375 or 75% of the outstanding debt. The termination date on our existing swap position is December 31, 2010. However, we intend to use discretion in managing this risk as market conditions vary over time, allowing for the possibility of adjusting the degree of hedge coverage as we deem appropriate. In any case, our use of interest rate derivatives will be restricted to use for risk management purposes. Market Risk Disclosures July 31, 2010 (in thousands) Instruments entered into for hedging purposes Type of Derivative Notional Size Fixed Price or Strike Price Underlying Price Termination or Expiration Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps $ 1,969 (1) 5.30 % 3 Mo. USD LIBOR 12/31/2010 $ (40 ) (1) The value shown reflects the notional as of July 31, 2010. Over the term of the swap, the notional amortizes, dropping to approximately $1,313. As of July 31, 2010, the dollar value of a basis point for this interest rate swap was approximately $35, suggesting that a one basis point rise (fall) of the yield curve would likely foster an increase (decrease) in the interest rate swaps value by approximately $35. Because hedge accounting is applied, the contract serves to lock in a fixed rate of interest for the portion of the variable rate debt equal to the swaps notional size. The swap covers only 75% of our variable rate exposure. 64
