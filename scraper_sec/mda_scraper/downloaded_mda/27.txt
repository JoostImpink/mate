ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those described herein. See URS Corporation and Subsidiaries regarding forward looking statements on page 1. You should read this discussion in conjunction with Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page H20; the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report. BUSINESS SUMMARY We are a leading international provider of engineering, construction and technical services. We offer a broad range of program management, planning, design, engineering, construction and construction management, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning and closure services to public agencies and private sector clients around the world. We also are a U.S. federal government contractor in the areas of systems engineering and technical assistance, operations and maintenance, management and operations, and IT services. With approximately 50,000 employees, as of January 31, 2014, in a global network of offices and contract specific job sites in nearly 50 countries, we provide services for federal, infrastructure, oil and gas, power and industrial programs and projects. Our strategy is to maintain a balanced portfolio of diversified businesses that serve a variety of markets worldwide. We believe that this strategy helps to mitigate our exposure to industrial, technological, environmental, financial, economic and political risks that may affect a particular market or geographic region. Our growth strategy involves both organic growth as well as add on acquisitions to complement our technical capabilities or enable us to serve new geographic regions. We generate revenues by providing fee based professional and technical services and by executing construction contracts. As a result, our professional and technical services are primarily labor intensive and our construction projects are labor and capital intensive. To derive income from our revenues, we must effectively manage our costs. Our revenues are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified and productive employees, identify business opportunities, allocate our labor resources to profitable markets, secure new contracts, execute existing contracts, and maintain existing client relationships. Moreover, as a professional services company, the quality of the work generated by our employees is integral to our revenue generation. Our cost of revenues is comprised of the compensation we pay to our employees, including fringe benefits; the cost of subcontractors, construction materials and other project related expenses; and segment administrative, marketing, sales, bid and proposal, rental and other overhead costs. We report our financial results on a consolidated basis and for our four reporting segments: the Infrastructure & Environment Division, the Federal Services Division, the Energy & Construction Division and the Oil & Gas Division. 44 OVERVIEW AND BUSINESS TRENDS Fiscal Year 2013 Results Consolidated revenues for the year ended January 3, 2014 were $11.0 billion, an increase of $18.2 million, or 0.2%, compared to revenues for fiscal year 2012. During the 2013 fiscal year, revenues increased from our work in the oil and gas market sector, as our results reflect a full year of Flint operations in 2013 compared with a partial year in 2012, and from our work in the infrastructure market sector. By contrast, revenues in the industrial market sector were essentially flat, and we experienced declines in revenues from our work in the federal and power market sectors. Net income attributable to URS for the year ended January 3, 2014 was $247.2 million compared with net income of $310.6 million for the year ended December 28, 2012, primarily due to underperformance in the Oil & Gas Division. This decrease was partially offset by earnings from our work managing chemical demilitarization programs. Cash Flows and Debt During the year ended January 3, 2014, we generated $614.2 million in net cash from operations. Cash flows from operations increased by $184.0 million for fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012. This increase was primarily due to the timing of billings, collections and advance payments from clients on accounts receivable, income tax payments, and dividend distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase was partially offset by the timing of vendor and subcontractor payments, and salary and employee benefit payments. In addition, we had cash outflows of $184.9 million related to the redemption of the Canadian Notes, which included principal and a prepayment fee, $93.3 million related to repurchases of our common stock, and $62.2 million of cash dividends paid during the year ended January 3, 2014. Book of Business As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, our total book of business was $22.8 billion and $24.9 billion, respectively. Our backlog and option years decreased primarily due to the continuing delays in contract awards and an increase in short term extensions on existing contracts for work we perform for the U.S. federal government. Our IDCs increased mainly due to the continuing shift towards the use of IDCs by both public and particularly, private sector clients. Business Trends It is difficult to predict the impact of the continuing global economic weakness on our business or to forecast business trends accurately. We believe that our expectations regarding business trends are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions. However, such forward looking statements, by their nature, involve risks and uncertainties and, in the current economic climate, may be subject to an unusual degree of uncertainty. You should read this discussion of business trends in conjunction with Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report, which begins on page 20. Government budget deficits and debt burdens, federal budget cutbacks and potential sequestration, the U.S. federal government shutdown in October 2013, slow economic growth, and efforts made to address any of these issues could negatively affect our business. In particular, federal expenditures have been adversely affected due to the October 2013 federal government shutdown, and other federal budget issues, such as sequestration resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011. Federal spending cutbacks will also result from the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and we could face additional government shutdowns and increasing budget cuts as a result of sequestration in the future that may impact our work for the DOD and other federal agencies. Any significant reduction in federal government spending could reduce the demand for our overall services, and result in the cancellation or delay of existing projects, as well as potential projects in our book of business. 45 Federal Market Sector Due to U.S. federal budget cuts and continuing budget uncertainty, we expect to continue experiencing delays in procurement decisions, project cancellations and reductions in spending on some existing contracts. Federal spending cutbacks will also result from the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and we could face additional government shutdowns and increasing budget cuts as a result of sequestration in the future, all of which could impact our work for the DOD and other federal agencies. These budget cuts have resulted in reduced funding for some of the work we perform on behalf of the U.S. federal government. Despite these budget challenges, we anticipate stable funding for some of the specialized technical services we provide to federal government agencies in support of programs that are vital to national security or mandated by law. This includes support of electronic warfare, threat reduction, counter terrorism, and cyber security programs. We have multiple contracts to manage the destruction of chemical agents and weapons at various DOD chemical demilitarization facilities, including at the Umatilla Chemical Depot, the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, the Pine Bluff Arsenal, the Anniston Army Depot, the Blue Grass Army Depot and Pueblo Chemical Depot. Revenues and operating income from the various chemical demilitarization contracts were, collectively, $648 million and $213 million, respectively, for the year ended January 3, 2014. These amounts primarily reflect accelerated incentive awards of $143 million at several project facilities as a result of our achievement of early completion milestones, including $53 million related to the commencement of the recognition of performance based incentive awards on one project. Because we have met numerous early completion milestones at four of the project facilities, these sites are either in or are expected to transition to the closure phase. While we expect to continue generating revenues and operating income from these projects in the future, we anticipate that these amounts will decline as the projects approach final completion. We estimate that revenues and operating income from these projects will decrease by over 50% in 2014 as compared to 2013. Infrastructure Market Sector As a result of increased tax revenues and improved budgets, many states are moving forward with additional funding for infrastructure improvement programs, although some states continue to experience budget challenges. Some states also have instituted alternative funding mechanisms, such as dedicated tax measures, user fees and public private partnerships, to finance infrastructure projects. Additionally, in February 2014, President Obama outlined a plan for a four year, $302 billion federal transportation authorization to replace the two year, $105 billion Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, which expires on September 30, 2014. If enacted by Congress, the plan would significantly increase current levels of funding for highways, rail and mass transit infrastructure. Oil and Gas Market Sector During the second quarter of the 2012 fiscal year, we acquired Flint, a provider of construction and maintenance services to clients in the North American oil and gas industry. The acquisition significantly expanded our presence in the North American oil and gas market sector. As a result of the acquisition, we expect that any increase in capital spending to develop North American oil and gas resources could lead to increased demand for the engineering, construction and operations and maintenance services that we provide to clients in the oil and gas market sector. We may continue to be affected by a slowdown in project activity due to continued low natural gas prices and limited pipeline capacity for oil produced in the Canadian oil sands. Power Market Sector We expect that stagnant demand for power and lower plant utilization rates will continue to limit spending for new fossil and nuclear plants. In addition, the shift from the development of coal fired power generating facilities to natural gas, and challenges to the implementation of new emission control regulations, have resulted, and could continue to result, in lower demand for the air quality control services we provide to utilities. By contrast, we could benefit from new investments being made in transmission and distribution systems to improve the efficiency and reliability of these systems and to accommodate the transmission of electricity from alternative and renewable energy sources. In addition, following events at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued new safety requirements to strengthen containment structures and to improve on site flood control and seismic safety plans, which could result in increased demand for the engineering, procurement and construction services we provide. 46 Industrial Market Sector We are encouraged about signs of recovery in our industrial market sector. If our clients experience an increase in demand for durable goods, we could see increased demand for the engineering, procurement, construction and facilities management services we provide. In addition, we expect to continue to benefit from steady demand for the environmental and engineering services we provide to industrial clients under Master Service Agreements (MSAs). These services typically support our clients ongoing operations and help them comply with regulatory mandates. We also anticipate growth in our mining business in the U.S. and Australia as a result of new contract awards in 2013. Seasonality We experience seasonal trends in our business in connection with holidays. Our revenues typically are lower during these times of the year because many of our clients employees, as well as our own employees, do not work during these holidays, resulting in fewer billable hours charged to projects and thus, lower revenues recognized. In addition to holidays, our business also is affected by seasonal bad weather conditions, such as hurricanes, floods, snowstorms or other inclement weather, which may cause some of our offices and projects to close or reduce activities temporarily. For example, in the first quarter of the year, winter weather sometimes results in intermittent office closures and work interruptions. In our Oil & Gas Division, winter weather enables increased access to remote work areas in Northern Canada, while spring road bans limit access to work areas in Canada and the Northern U.S. Other Business Trends The diversification of our business and changes in the mix and timing of our fixed cost, target price and other contracts can cause earnings and profit margins to vary between periods. For example, we have, for some time, experienced an increase in the number of fixed price contract opportunities, particularly among clients in the federal, power, infrastructure, and oil and gas market sectors. The increase in fixed price contracting creates additional risks of incurring losses and opportunities for achieving higher margins on these contracts. There is also an increase in the award of federal contracts based on a low price, technically acceptable criteria emphasizing price over qualitative factors, such as past performance. As a result, pricing pressure may reduce our profit margins on future federal contracts. Also, our public and private sector clients are increasingly using IDCs that require us to engage in a competitive procurement process before any task orders are issued as compared to traditional award contracts. Additionally, the traditional award contracts we receive are tending to include fewer base years and more option years. These trends change the relationship between backlog and revenues, resulting in smaller, shorter term increments moving from IDCs and option years into backlog and then potentially realized as revenues. Ultimately, however, revenues from IDC task orders and option years will typically lower our reported backlog and increase our reported IDC and option years in our book of business. In addition, earnings recognition on many contracts is measured based on progress achieved as a percentage of the total project effort or upon the completion of milestones or performance criteria rather than evenly or linearly over the period of performance. We cannot determine if proposed climate change and greenhouse gas regulations would have a material impact on our business or our clients businesses at this time; however, any new regulations could affect demand for the services we provide to our clients. For example, depending on legislation enacted, we could see reduced client demand for our services related to fossil fuel and industrial projects, and increased demand for services related to environmental, infrastructure and nuclear and alternative energy. 47 CONSOLIDATED REVENUES BY MARKET SECTOR The Year Ended January 3, 2014 Compared with the Year Ended December 28, 2012 Year Ended Percentage January 3, December 28, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2012 (1) (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenues by Market Sector: Federal $ 3,719.5 $ 4,435.0 $ (715.5 ) (16.1 %) Infrastructure 1,936.3 1,791.4 144.9 8.1 % Oil and Gas 3,227.1 2,310.6 916.5 39.7 % Power 973.1 1,304.4 (331.3 ) (25.4 %) Industrial 1,134.7 1,131.1 3.6 0.3 % Total revenues, net of eliminations $ 10,990.7 $ 10,972.5 $ 18.2 0.2 % (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. Consolidated Revenues by Market Sector Our consolidated revenues for the year ended January 3, 2014 were $11.0 billion, an increase of $18.2 million, or 0.2%, compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. The following discussion of revenues by market sector analyzes and explains the year over year changes. Federal Year Ended Percentage January 3, December 28, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2012 (Decrease) (Decrease) Federal Market Sector: Infrastructure & Environment $ 562.3 $ 670.1 $ (107.8 ) (16.1 %) Federal Services 2,261.1 2,720.8 (459.7 ) (16.9 %) Energy & Construction 896.1 1,044.1 (148.0 ) (14.2 %) Federal total $ 3,719.5 $ 4,435.0 $ (715.5 ) (16.1 %) Consolidated revenues from our federal market sector for the year ended January 3, 2014 declined compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. During the 2013 fiscal year, revenues from many of the services we provide to federal government agencies in the U.S. declined due to continuing delays in the award of new contracts because of the ongoing federal budget debate, the federal government shutdown in October 2013, and sequestration. As a result, revenues decreased from the engineering, facility construction, systems engineering, technical assistance, and operations and maintenance services we provide to the DOD. Revenues also declined from our work under various contracts managing the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles at chemical agent disposal facilities in the U.S. At many of these facilities, our work has transitioned from the operations phase to the closure phase, resulting in lower levels of activity. Our work providing management and operations services to the DOE also was affected by lower funding and sequestration, resulting in decreased activity at the DOE sites we manage. 48 Infrastructure Year Ended Percentage January 3, December 28, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2012 (Decrease) (Decrease) Infrastructure Market Sector: Infrastructure & Environment $ 1,647.4 $ 1,550.1 $ 97.3 6.3 % Energy & Construction 288.9 241.3 47.6 19.7 % Infrastructure total $ 1,936.3 $ 1,791.4 $ 144.9 8.1 % Consolidated revenues from our infrastructure market sector for the year ended January 3, 2014 increased compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. Revenues increased during the 2013 fiscal year from the planning, design, engineering, and program and construction management services we provide for the development of surface, air, rail, and mass transit transportation infrastructure. Revenues also grew from the services we provide to expand and modernize water storage, conveyance and treatment systems. In addition, we experienced high levels of activity on a project to construct a dam in Illinois and on a streetcar line construction project in Atlanta. This increase was partially offset by a decline in our work modernizing and expanding educational and health care facilities due to the completion of assignments that have not been replaced by similar projects. Oil and Gas Year Ended Percentage January 3, December 28, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2012 (Decrease) (Decrease) Oil and Gas Market Sector: Infrastructure & Environment $ 559.4 $ 552.5 $ 6.9 1.2 % Energy & Construction 484.9 288.9 196.0 67.8 % Oil & Gas (1) 2,182.8 1,469.2 713.6 48.6 % Oil and Gas total $ 3,227.1 $ 2,310.6 $ 916.5 39.7 % (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. Consolidated revenues from our oil and gas market sector for the year ended January 3, 2014 increased compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. The growth in our oil and gas business primarily reflects the acquisition of Flint, which became our Oil & Gas Division at the completion of the acquisition on May 14, 2012. During the 2013 fiscal year, the Oil & Gas Division generated $2.2 billion in revenues from work providing construction and maintenance services to the North American oil and gas industry. During the 2012 fiscal year, the Oil & Gas Division generated $1.5 billion in revenues beginning May 14, 2012 through December 28, 2012. In addition to the effects of the Flint acquisition, revenues also increased from the environmental and engineering services we provide to oil and gas clients worldwide through long term MSAs, as well as from projects to construct natural gas production facilities. 49 Power Year Ended Percentage January 3, December 28, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2012 (Decrease) (Decrease) Power Market Sector: Infrastructure & Environment $ 247.6 $ 209.8 $ 37.8 18.0 % Energy & Construction 725.5 1,094.6 (369.1 ) (33.7 %) Power total $ 973.1 $ 1,304.4 $ (331.3 ) (25.4 %) Consolidated revenues from our power market sector for the year ended January 3, 2014 decreased compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. During the 2013 fiscal year, revenues decreased from our work retrofitting coal fired power plants with air quality control systems as a result of the completion of assignments that experienced high levels of activity in 2012. We also experienced delays and suspensions of new projects, resulting from regulatory uncertainty and stagnant demand for electricity. Revenues also declined from projects involving the replacement of major components at nuclear power plants, due largely to the completion of two major assignments that have not been replaced by comparable projects. By contrast, we experienced an increase in revenues from the environmental remediation services we provide for the decommissioning and closure of power generating facilities that are no longer in operation. Industrial Year Ended Percentage January 3, December 28, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2012 (Decrease) (Decrease) Industrial Market Sector: Infrastructure & Environment $ 665.3 $ 700.5 $ (35.2 ) (5.0 %) Energy & Construction 469.4 430.6 38.8 9.0 % Industrial total $ 1,134.7 $ 1,131.1 $ 3.6 0.3 % Consolidated revenues from our industrial market sector for the year ended January 3, 2014 were essentially flat compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. In fiscal 2013, we experienced increased activity and revenues on a contract to construct a chemical production facility in Tennessee, and we benefitted from sustained demand for the environmental and engineering services we provide to manufacturing and other industrial clients worldwide through long term MSAs. By contrast, revenues declined from the engineering and construction services we provide to support mine expansion projects, due largely to the completion of a large project in Australia to construct a mine tailings facility, as well as the wind down of a contract to operate a phosphate mine in Canada. These declines were partially offset by increased activity on new mining projects in Arizona and New Mexico. Revenues also declined from our work providing facility management services to manufacturing clients, reflecting a decrease in the volume of work on existing contracts and from the planning and design services we provide to commercial clients. 50 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The Year Ended January 3, 2014 Compared with the Year Ended December 28, 2012 Year Ended Percentage (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) January 3, December 28, Increase Increase 2014 2012 (1) (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenues $ 10,990.7 $ 10,972.5 $ 18.2 0.2 % Cost of revenues (10,416.0 ) (10,294.5 ) 121.5 1.2 % General and administrative expenses (77.5 ) (83.6 ) (6.1 ) (7.3 %) Acquisition related expenses (16.1 ) (16.1 ) N/M Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 93.6 107.6 (14.0 ) (13.0 %) Operating income 590.8 685.9 (95.1 ) (13.9 %) Interest expense (86.1 ) (70.7 ) 15.4 21.8 % Other income (expense), net (7.7 ) 0.5 (8.2 ) (1640.0 %) Income before income taxes 497.0 615.7 (118.7 ) (19.3 %) Income tax expense (167.7 ) (189.9 ) (22.2 ) (11.7 %) Net income including noncontrolling interests 329.3 425.8 (96.5 ) (22.7 %) Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries (82.1 ) (115.2 ) (33.1 ) (28.7 %) Net income attributable to URS $ 247.2 $ 310.6 $ (63.4 ) (20.4 %) Diluted earnings per share $ 3.31 $ 4.17 $ (0.86 ) (20.6 %) N/M Not meaningful (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. 51 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS BY DIVISION Revenues (In millions, except percentages) Infrastructure & Environment Federal Services Energy & Construction Oil & Gas (1) Eliminations Total Year ended January 3, 2014 $ 3,758.0 $ 2,263.0 $ 2,911.0 $ 2,208.2 $ (149.5 ) $ 10,990.7 December 28, 2012 3,792.1 2,721.6 3,138.1 1,475.1 (154.4 ) 10,972.5 Increase (decrease) (34.1 ) (458.6 ) (227.1 ) 733.1 (4.9 ) 18.2 Percentage increase (decrease) (0.9 %) (16.9 %) (7.2 %) 49.7 % (3.2 %) 0.2 % (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. The revenues reported are presented prior to the elimination of inter segment transactions. Our analysis of the changes in revenues by reporting segment is discussed below. The Infrastructure & Environment Divisions Revenues The Infrastructure & Environment Divisions revenues were essentially flat for the year ended January 3, 2014 compared to the year ended December 28, 2012. During the 2013 fiscal year, decreases in federal spending, the federal government shutdown and delays in new project awards resulted in lower revenues in the federal market sector. We also experienced a decrease in revenues from the environmental and engineering services we provide to mining clients, which was partially offset by an increase in revenues from the services we provide to chemical and other industrial clients. By contrast, we experienced an increase in revenues from planning, design, engineering, and program and construction management services for the development of surface, air, and rail transportation infrastructure, as well as from the environmental remediation services we provide in the power market sector for the decommissioning and closure of power facilities. The Federal Services Divisions Revenues The Federal Services Divisions revenues decreased for the year ended January 3, 2014 compared to the year ended December 28, 2012. Revenues associated with our chemical agent demilitarization programs declined from $814.8 million for the year ended December 28, 2012 to $648.0 million for the year ended January 3, 2014. This decline reflects the transition at several facilities from the operations phase of the projects to the closure phase, which is characterized by lower levels of activity. Revenues related to other services also declined as a result of delayed awards on new and existing programs, the conclusion of several task orders on large IT projects, delays in finalizing the DODs budget, and the effects of sequestration. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues from our work supporting the DODs threat detection programs. The Energy & Construction Divisions Revenues The Energy & Construction Divisions revenues for the year ended January 3, 2014 decreased compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of large air quality control projects and delays in new project awards in the power market sector. In addition, revenues declined due to the timing and completion of maintenance outage work at nuclear power plants and the termination of work on a refinery project. In addition, the federal government shutdown and reduced funding resulted in lower revenues from our work providing nuclear management services to the DOE and project ramp down related to projects in the oil and gas market sector also contributed to decreased revenues. These decreases were partially offset by the start up of a new air quality control project in the power sector as well as higher revenues from projects involving the construction of natural gas production facilities and a chemical production facility. 52 The Oil & Gas Divisions Revenues The Oil & Gas Divisions revenues for the year ended January 3, 2014 increased substantially from the prior year, reflecting the May 14, 2012 acquisition of Flint. Our results reflect a full year of Flint operations in 2013 compared with a partial year in 2012. These revenues were derived from the construction and construction management, and operations and maintenance services that we provide, including facility and pipeline construction, transportation, and asset management and maintenance services, for the North American oil and gas industry. Since the acquisition, the revenues of Flint have been included in our consolidated results under our Oil & Gas Division. During fiscal year 2013, revenues were adversely affected by unusually severe weather conditions in Western Canada that disrupted activities at project sites; project deferrals due to a slowdown in activity in the natural gas market caused by continued low prices, which, in turn, resulted in reduced natural gas related drilling activities; and limited pipeline capacity for oil produced in the Canadian oil sands. Cost of Revenues (In millions, except percentages) Infrastructure & Environment Federal Services Energy & Construction Oil & Gas (1) Eliminations Total Year ended January 3, 2014 $ (3,546.3 ) $ (2,000.8 ) $ (2,821.9 ) $ (2,196.5 ) $ 149.5 $ (10,416.0 ) December 28, 2012 (3,575.2 ) (2,478.7 ) (2,976.9 ) (1,418.1 ) 154.4 (10,294.5 ) Increase (decrease) (28.9 ) (477.9 ) (155.0 ) 778.4 (4.9 ) 121.5 Percentage increase (decrease) (0.8 %) (19.3 %) (5.2 %) 54.9 % (3.2 %) 1.2 % (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. Our consolidated cost of revenues, which consists of labor, subcontractor costs, and other expenses related to projects, and services provided to our clients, for the year ended January 3, 2014 increased compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. Because our revenues are primarily project based, the factors that generally caused revenues to increase or decrease also drove a corresponding increase or decrease in our cost of revenues. In addition, project execution issues in the Oil & Gas Division caused the percentage increase in our cost of revenues to be inconsistent with the percentage increase in our revenues. Consolidated cost of revenues as a percent of revenues increased from 93.8% for the year ended December 28, 2012 to 94.8% for the year ended January 3, 2014. General and Administrative Expenses Our consolidated general and administrative (G&A)expenses for the year ended January 3, 2014 decreased by $6.1 million or 7.3% compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. The decrease in G&A expenses was due primarily to reductions in employee incentive compensation expense of $10.1 million and legal expenses of $2.4 million, partially offset by increases in auditing and accounting services of $2.8 million resulting from the registration of the Senior Notes. Consolidated G&A expenses as a percent of revenues were 0.7% for the year ended January 3, 2014 compared to 0.8% for the year ended December 28, 2012. 53 Acquisition related Expenses Our consolidated acquisition related expenses generally include legal fees, consultation fees, travel expenses, and other miscellaneous direct and incremental administrative expenses. We did not incur any acquisition related expenses for the year ended January 3, 2014. For the year ended December 28, 2012, we recorded $16.1 million of acquisition related expenses for our acquisition of Flint. Equity in Income (Loss) of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures (In millions, except percentages) Infrastructure & Environment Federal Services Energy & Construction Oil & Gas (1) Total Year ended January 3, 2014 $ 2.4 $ 6.3 $ 86.7 $ (1.8 ) $ 93.6 December 28, 2012 4.0 6.4 93.0 4.2 107.6 Increase (decrease) (1.6 ) (0.1 ) (6.3 ) (6.0 ) (14.0 ) Percentage increase (decrease) (40.0 %) (1.6 %) (6.8 %) (142.9 %) (13.0 %) (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. Our consolidated equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended January 3, 2014 decreased compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $9.0 million decrease in earnings resulting from lower target cost savings at one of the nuclear management, operations and cleanup projects in the U.K., and a $7.9 million decrease in earnings from a light rail construction project nearing completion in 2013. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings at another nuclear cleanup project in the U.K. as a result of new contractual earnings metrics and increased earnings from a mining joint venture in Australia. In addition, our equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures included $7.7 million and $4.5 million of amortization of intangible assets for a joint venture that provides services to the Canadian energy sector for the years ended January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, respectively. Operating Income (In millions, except percentages) Infrastructure & Environment Federal Services Energy & Construction Oil & Gas (1) Corporate Total Year ended January 3, 2014 $ 214.1 $ 268.5 $ 175.8 $ 9.9 $ (77.5 ) $ 590.8 December 28, 2012 220.9 249.3 254.2 61.2 $ (99.7 ) 685.9 Increase (decrease) (6.8 ) 19.2 (78.4 ) (51.3 ) $ (22.2 ) (95.1 ) Percentage increase (decrease) (3.1 %) 7.7 % (30.8 %) (83.8 %) (22.3 %) (13.9 %) (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for the year ended January 3, 2014 was 5.4% compared to 6.3% for the year ended December 28, 2012. The decrease in operating income in fiscal year 2013 relative to the corresponding period of 2012 was due to multiple factors, including lower revenues associated with work for the U.S. federal government, the completion of several large fossil and nuclear power projects, and execution issues in our Oil & Gas Division, which were identified in the fourth quarter and led to a significant deterioration in project earnings. Our Oil & Gas Division also experienced project delays caused, in part, by the residual effects of lower than expected natural gas prices and pipeline capacity. The decrease was partially offset by reductions in employee incentive compensation expense of $65.5 million, as well as the favorable resolution of a $23.3 million accrual associated with the estimated costs of employee benefit obligations on chemical demilitarization programs that was incurred in the prior year. See the detailed discussion of operating income by segment below. 54 The Infrastructure & Environment Divisions Operating Income Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 5.7% for the year ended January 3, 2014 compared to 5.8% for the year ended December 28, 2012. The decrease in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenues was attributable to a combination of a decrease in revenues and an increase in overhead costs, such as benefits and foreign exchange fluctuations. Overhead costs as a percentage of revenues increased to 31.9% for the year ended January 3, 2014 from 31.1% for the year ended December 28, 2012. The Federal Services Divisions Operating Income Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 11.9% for the year ended January 3, 2014 compared to 9.2% for the year ended December 28, 2012. The increase in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the favorable resolution of a $23.3 million accrual associated with the estimated costs of employee benefit obligations incurred on chemical demilitarization programs in the prior year, the recognition of $31.1 million in performance related incentive fees on one of our chemical demilitarization contracts, and decreased overhead, including employee incentive compensation, costs. These increases in operating income were partially offset by the recognition of a $40.0 million programmatic schedule incentive fee related to the chemical demilitarization program in the prior year, completion in fiscal 2013 of several IT projects and projects generating lower margins caused by an increasingly competitive pricing environment. The Energy & Construction Divisions Operating Income Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 6.0% for the year ended January 3, 2014 compared to 8.1% for the year ended December 28, 2012. The decrease in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenues was due to a $38.5 million decline in earnings as a result of the substantial completion of a power project and deceleration of another power project, both of which recognized significant target cost savings in the prior year, a $21.0 million decrease in earnings resulting from the completion of maintenance outage work at nuclear power plants, a $19.8 million decrease at a DOE nuclear clean up project that had high target cost savings in the previous year, a $12.7 million decrease in earnings resulting from the completion of a DOE nuclear cleanup project, and decreased earnings of $6.3 million on projects accounted for as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures, as described above. In addition, we incurred a charge of $7.9 million for a reduction in the market value of a real property held for sale due to a change in the zoning ordinance applicable to the property in fiscal year 2013. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings of $12.4 million due to the initial profit recognition of a new air quality control project and $11.9 million associated with the construction of natural gas facilities. Additionally, reductions in employee incentive compensation expense and overhead partially offset the impact of lower revenues during the current period. The Oil & Gas Divisions Operating Income Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 0.4% for the year ended January 3, 2014 and included $49.2 million of amortization of intangible assets in connection with the Flint acquisition. In comparison, operating income as a percentage of revenues was 4.1% for the year ended December 28, 2012, which reflected activities from May 14, 2012, the effective date of the Flint acquisition, and included $38.6 million of amortization of intangible assets in connection with the Flint acquisition. The decrease in operating income was attributable to project execution issues on eight projects, primarily occurring during the fourth quarter, that led to a deterioration of project earnings of approximately $47 million for the 2013 fiscal year. Additionally, operating income was impacted by approximately $20 million due to unusually severe weather conditions in Western Canada and, during the fourth quarter, by a $7.2 million write off of an exclusive gas separation technology license as a result of the licensor filing for bankruptcy protection. Finally, results were also adversely affected by project deferrals due to a slowdown in activity in the natural gas market and limited pipeline capacity for oil produced in the Canadian oil sands. 55 Interest Expense Our consolidated interest expense for the year ended January 3, 2014 increased by $15.4 million or 21.8% compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. Interest expense increased primarily because we incurred a full year of interest in fiscal year 2013 compared to a partial year of interest in fiscal year 2012, related to the Senior Notes issued on March 15, 2012 and the Canadian Notes acquired as part of the Flint acquisition on May 14, 2012. In addition, we paid additional interest to holders of the Senior Notes during fiscal year 2013 due to the delay in the completion of our exchange offer, in which we offered to exchange identical Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for unregistered Senior Notes previously issued in connection with the acquisition of Flint. Other Income (Expense), Net Our consolidated other income (expense), net for the year ended January 3, 2014 consists of foreign currency losses of $7.7 million recognized on an intercompany financing arrangement. This amount compares to foreign currency gains of $0.8 million recognized on an intercompany financing arrangement and a net loss of $0.3 million recognized on foreign currency forward contracts for the year ended December 28, 2012. Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rates were 33.7% and 30.8% for the years ended January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, respectively. The higher rate was primarily attributable to U.S. tax on the sale of Canadian properties and dividends from a Canadian joint venture. Noncontrolling Interests in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries Our noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased by $33.1 million or 28.7% in the year ended January 3, 2014 compared with the year ended December 28, 2012. The decrease in noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries, net of tax was primarily due to a reduced level of activities as a result of the completion of maintenance outage work at nuclear power plants, lower earnings from a DOE nuclear clean up project and lower earnings from one of our U.K. joint ventures. 56 CONSOLIDATED REVENUES BY MARKET SECTOR The Year Ended December 28, 2012 Compared with the Year Ended December 30, 2011 Year Ended Percentage December 28, December 30, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2012 (1) 2011 (2) (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenues by Market Sector: Federal $ 4,435.0 $ 4,639.7 $ (204.7 ) (4.4 %) Infrastructure 1,791.4 1,861.3 (69.9 ) (3.8 %) Oil and Gas (3) 2,310.6 692.1 1,618.5 233.9 % Power 1,304.4 1,126.6 177.8 15.8 % Industrial (3) 1,131.1 1,225.3 (94.2 ) (7.7 %) Total revenues, net of eliminations $ 10,972.5 $ 9,545.0 $ 1,427.5 15.0 % (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. (2) The operating results of Apptis have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on June 1, 2011. (3) Historically, we have included revenues from the oil and gas market sector as part of our presentation of revenues from the industrial and commercial market sector. Effective at the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year, we revised our presentation to show our revenues from the oil and gas market sector separately. In addition, we changed the name of our industrial and commercial market sector to the industrial market sector. For comparative purposes, we reclassified the prior periods data to conform them to the current periods presentation. 57 Consolidated Revenues by Market Sector Our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 28, 2012 were $11.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 15.0%, compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. See the discussion of revenues by market sector below for more detail. Federal Year Ended Percentage December 28, December 30, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2012 2011 (Decrease) (Decrease) Federal Market Sector: Infrastructure & Environment $ 670.1 $ 636.5 $ 33.6 5.3 % Federal Services 2,720.8 2,694.3 26.5 1.0 % Energy & Construction 1,044.1 1,308.9 (264.8 ) (20.2 %) Federal total $ 4,435.0 $ 4,639.7 $ (204.7 ) (4.4 %) Consolidated revenues from our federal market sector for the year ended December 28, 2012 declined compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. During the 2012 fiscal year, revenues declined from the nuclear management services we provide to the DOE, due largely to the completion of ARRA stimulus funded projects, the completion of a cleanup and closure project at a former nuclear fuel reprocessing/treatment facility, as well as lower activity on on going DOE contracts. In addition, we experienced decreased demand for the systems engineering and technical assistance services we provide to the DOD for the development, testing and evaluation of new weapons systems and the modernization of aging weapons systems. The decrease in revenues from these activities was largely the result of delays in the award of new contracts and task orders under existing contracts. Revenues also declined from our work managing the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles at chemical agent disposal facilities throughout the U.S. This decline reflects the transition at several facilities from the operations phase of the project to the closure phase, which is characterized by lower levels of activity. By contrast, revenues increased from the federal IT market as a result of the acquisition of Apptis in June 2011. In addition, revenues grew from the services we provide to the DOD to maintain, repair and overhaul aircraft, ground vehicles and other equipment returning from military operations, as well as from increased activity on a contract to provide operations and installations management support at a space flight center. We also experienced increased demand for the design and construction services we provide to the DOD for the development of military facilities and related infrastructure. 58 Infrastructure Year Ended Percentage December 28, December 30, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2012 2011 (Decrease) (Decrease) Infrastructure Market Sector: Infrastructure & Environment $ 1,550.1 $ 1,544.0 $ 6.1 0.4 % Energy & Construction 241.3 317.3 (76.0 ) (24.0 %) Infrastructure total $ 1,791.4 $ 1,861.3 $ (69.9 ) (3.8 %) Consolidated revenues from our infrastructure market sector for the year ended December 28, 2012 decreased compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. The decline in infrastructure revenues was primarily due to the completion early in the 2012 fiscal year of a levee construction project in New Orleans, which experienced higher levels of activity and generated significant revenues during the 2011 fiscal year. The revenue decline also reflects a close out and settlement agreement reached on a light rail project and a toll road project. In addition, demand decreased for the services we provide to modernize and expand airports and educational facilities. By contrast, revenues increased from the planning, design, engineering, program and construction management services we provide to develop surface and rail transportation infrastructure, and water storage, conveyance and treatment systems. We also benefited from higher demand for our work providing program management services to international agencies in support of economic development efforts. Oil and Gas Year Ended Percentage December 28, December 30, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2012 2011 (Decrease) (Decrease) Oil and Gas Market Sector: (1) Infrastructure & Environment $ 552.5 $ 529.7 $ 22.8 4.3 % Energy & Construction 288.9 162.4 126.5 77.9 % Oil & Gas (2) 1,469.2 1,469.2 N/M Oil and Gas total $ 2,310.6 $ 692.1 $ 1,618.5 233.9 % N/M Not meaningful (1) Historically, we have included revenues from the oil and gas market sector as part of our presentation of revenues from the industrial and commercial market sector. Effective at the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year, we revised our presentation to show our revenues from the oil and gas market sector separately. In addition, we changed the name of our industrial and commercial market sector to the industrial market sector. For comparative purposes, we reclassified the prior periods data to conform them to the current periods presentation. (2) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. Consolidated revenues from our oil and gas market sector for the year ended December 28, 2012 increased compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. Our results reflect the acquisition of Flint on May 14, 2012. At the completion of the acquisition, Flint became our new Oil & Gas Division. For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2012, the Oil & Gas Division generated revenues of $1.5 billion from work providing construction and maintenance services to the North American oil and gas industry. We also benefited from strong demand for the environmental and engineering services we provide to multinational oil and gas clients at facilities worldwide through long term MSAs, as well as from increased activity on contracts to provide construction, facility management, and operations and maintenance services at refineries and other oil and gas facilities. 59 Power Year Ended Percentage December 28, December 30, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2012 2011 (Decrease) (Decrease) Power Market Sector: Infrastructure & Environment $ 209.8 $ 201.1 $ 8.7 4.3 % Energy & Construction 1,094.6 925.5 169.1 18.3 % Power total $ 1,304.4 $ 1,126.6 $ 177.8 15.8 % Consolidated revenues from our power market sector for the year ended December 28, 2012 increased compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. During the 2012 fiscal year, revenues increased from services we provide to retrofit and upgrade existing nuclear power plants to increase the generating capacity and extend the service life of these facilities. We also continued to experience a steady demand for our work in retrofitting coal fired power plants with air quality control systems that reduce emissions and help utilities comply with regulatory mandates, as well as from the compliance, permitting and remediation services we provide to mitigate the environmental impact of their operations. By contrast, revenues declined from the engineering, procurement and construction services we provide for the development of new fossil fuel and nuclear power generating facilities. Industrial Year Ended Percentage December 28, December 30, Increase Increase (In millions, except percentages) 2012 2011 (Decrease) (Decrease) Industrial Market Sector: (1) Infrastructure & Environment $ 700.5 $ 763.8 $ (63.3 ) (8.3 %) Energy & Construction 430.6 461.5 (30.9 ) (6.7 %) Industrial total $ 1,131.1 $ 1,225.3 $ (94.2 ) (7.7 %) Consolidated revenues from our industrial market sector for the year ended December 28, 2012 declined compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. The decline in revenues was largely driven by decreased demand for the environmental, engineering and construction services we provide to mining clients. During the 2011 fiscal year, we experienced high levels of activity and generated significant revenues from an engineering and construction mining project in Australia; the project has not been replaced by a comparable assignment. The decrease was partially offset by a moderate increase in revenues from the facilities management services we provide to manufacturing clients, resulting from increased activity on ongoing contracts and increased activities with other mining clients. 60 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The Year Ended December 28, 2012 Compared with the Year Ended December 30, 2011 Year Ended Percentage (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) December 28, December 30, Increase Increase 2012 (1) 2011 (2) (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenues $ 10,972.5 $ 9,545.0 $ 1,427.5 15.0 % Cost of revenues (10,294.5 ) (8,988.8 ) 1,305.7 14.5 % General and administrative expenses (83.6 ) (79.5 ) 4.1 5.2 % Acquisition related expenses (16.1 ) (1.0 ) 15.1 N/M Restructuring costs (5.5 ) (5.5 ) N/M Goodwill impairment (351.3 ) (351.3 ) N/M Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 107.6 132.2 (24.6 ) (18.6 %) Operating income 685.9 251.1 434.8 173.2 % Interest expense (70.7 ) (22.1 ) 48.6 219.9 % Other income, net 0.5 0.5 N/M Income before income taxes 615.7 229.0 386.7 168.9 % Income tax expense (189.9 ) (143.4 ) 46.5 32.4 % Net income including noncontrolling interests 425.8 85.6 340.2 397.4 % Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries (115.2 ) (128.5 ) (13.3 ) (10.4 %) Net income (loss) attributable to URS $ 310.6 $ (42.9 ) $ 353.5 824.0 % Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 4.17 $ (0.56 ) $ 4.73 844.6 % N/M Not meaningful (1) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012.

(2) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. The revenues reported are presented prior to the elimination of inter segment transactions. Our analysis of the changes in revenues by reporting segment is discussed below. The Infrastructure & Environment Divisions Revenues The Infrastructure & Environment Divisions revenues were essentially flat for the year ended December 28, 2012 compared to the year ended December 30, 2011. During the 2012 fiscal year, revenues increased from the services we provide to expand and modernize surface and rail transportation infrastructure, as well as from our work providing program management services to international aid agencies in support of economic development efforts. We also benefited from strong demand for our work providing engineering and construction services to the DOD for the development of military facilities and related infrastructure. In addition, demand grew for the compliance, permitting and remediation services we perform in the power sector to assist utilities in meeting regulatory requirements and mitigating the environmental impact of their operations. By contrast, we experienced a decline in revenues from the environmental and engineering services we provide to industrial and mining clients. The results in our mining market reflect the completion of an engineering and construction assignment, which generated significant revenues in the comparable period last year and was not replaced by a similar project. In the oil and gas sector, revenues declined from our work supporting a major pipeline project in Alaska, due to the postponement of the project, while we continued to benefit from strong demand for the environmental and engineering services we provide to multinational oil and gas clients at facilities worldwide through long term MSAs. The Federal Services Divisions Revenues The Federal Services Divisions revenues were essentially flat for the year ended December 28, 2012 compared to the year ended December 30, 2011. Revenues increased from the IT services we now provide to federal clients, as a result of our June 2011 acquisition of Apptis. Revenues from the services we provide to the DOD to maintain, repair and overhaul aircraft, ground vehicles and other equipment were essentially flat. Revenues from our work managing the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles at chemical agent disposal facilities declined. This decline reflects the transition at several facilities from the operations phase of the project to the closure phase, which is characterized by lower levels of activity. 62 The Energy & Construction Divisions Revenues The Energy & Construction Divisions revenues for the year ended December 28, 2012 decreased compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of a large power project and a large levee construction project in the prior year. In addition, revenues declined from our work providing nuclear management services to the DOE, as a result of completing ARRA stimulus funded projects and lower activity on ongoing DOE projects compared to the same period last year. These decreases were partially offset by the start up of new projects, including a new air quality control project at a coal fired power plant and projects to replace steam generators at nuclear power plants. However, revenues during the engineering and early construction phases associated with the start up of projects tend to be lower than revenues during the active construction phases. During the year ended December 30, 2011, there were more projects in active construction compared to the year ended December 28, 2012. As a result, revenues for the year ended December 28, 2012 were relatively lower than for the year ended December 30, 2011. The Oil & Gas Divisions Revenues The Oil & Gas Divisions revenues for the year ended December 28, 2012 were derived from the construction and construction management, and operations and maintenance services that we provide, including facility and pipeline construction, transportation, and asset management and maintenance services, for the North American oil and gas industry. Since the acquisition on May 14, 2012, the revenues of Flint have been included in our consolidated results under our Oil & Gas Division. Cost of Revenues (In millions, except percentages) Infrastructure & Environment Federal Services (1) Energy & Construction Oil & Gas (2) Eliminations Total Year ended December 28, 2012 $ (3,575.2 ) $ (2,478.7 ) $ (2,976.9 ) $ (1,418.1 ) $ 154.4 $ (10,294.5 ) December 30, 2011 (3,537.2 ) (2,503.9 ) (3,110.1 ) 162.4 (8,988.8 ) Increase (decrease) 38.0 (25.2 ) (133.2 ) 1,418.1 (8.0 ) 1,305.7 Percentage increase (decrease) 1.1 % (1.0 %) (4.3 %) N/M (4.9 %) 14.5 % (1) The operating results of Apptis have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on June 1, 2011. (2) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. Our consolidated cost of revenues, which consists of labor, subcontractor costs, and other expenses related to projects, and services provided to our clients, for the year ended December 28, 2012 increased compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. Because our revenues are primarily project based, the factors that generally caused revenues to increase or decrease also drove a corresponding increase or decrease in our cost of revenues. Consolidated cost of revenues as a percent of revenues decreased from 94.2% for the year ended December 30, 2011 to 93.8% for the year ended December 28, 2012. General and Administrative Expenses Our consolidated G&A expenses for the year ended December 28, 2012 increased by 5.2% compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. The increase in G&A expenses was due primarily to increases in employee salaries and the related benefit expenses of $2.4 million, foreign currency loss of $1.5 million, legal expenses of $1.2 million, and corporate communication and information technology related expenses of $0.8 million, partially offset by the release of $2.1 million of sales tax reserve. Consolidated G&A expenses as a percent of revenues was 0.8% for both years ended December 28, 2012 and December 30, 2011. 63 Acquisition related Expenses Our consolidated acquisition related expenses generally include legal fees, consultation fees, travel expenses, and other miscellaneous direct and incremental administrative expenses. For the year ended December 28, 2012, we recorded $16.1 million of acquisition related expenses for our acquisition of Flint. Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs consisted primarily of costs for severance and associated benefits. We did not incur restructuring costs for the year ended December 28, 2012. For the year ended December 30, 2011, our restructuring costs were $5.5 million, the majority of which resulted from the integration of Scott Wilson into our existing U.K. and European business and necessary responses to reductions in market opportunities in Europe. Goodwill Impairment Our 2012 annual review, performed as of October 26, 2012, did not indicate any impairment to our goodwill in any of our reporting units. For the year ended December 30, 2011, we recognized an impairment charge of $351.3 million affecting one of our six reporting units. On a net, after tax basis, this charge resulted in decreases to net income and diluted EPS of $309.4 million and $3.99, respectively, for the year ended December 30, 2011. Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures (In millions, except percentages) Infrastructure & Environment Federal Services (1) Energy & Construction Oil & Gas (2) Total Year ended December 28, 2012 $ 4.0 $ 6.4 $ 93.0 $ 4.2 $ 107.6 December 30, 2011 3.9 6.2 122.1 132.2 Increase (decrease) 0.1 0.2 (29.1 ) 4.2 (24.6 ) Percentage increase (decrease) 2.6 % 3.2 % (23.8 %) N/M (18.6 %) (1) The operating results of Apptis have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on June 1, 2011. (2) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. Our consolidated equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 28, 2012 decreased compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $21.1 million decrease in earnings from nuclear management, operations and cleanup projects in the U.K., a $9.5 million favorable settlement on a highway construction project during the year ended December 30, 2011, and a $5.9 million decrease in earnings on a DOE cleanup project due to the timing of recognizing target cost savings and other performance based earnings. These decreases were partially offset by an $8.2 million increase in earnings from a light rail project. 64 Operating Income (Loss) (In millions, except percentages) Infrastructure & Environment Federal Services (1) Energy & Construction Oil & Gas (2) Corporate Total Year ended December 28, 2012 $ 220.9 $ 249.3 $ 254.2 $ 61.2 $ (99.7 ) $ 685.9 December 30, 2011 222.0 (154.5 ) 263.1 $ (79.5 ) 251.1 Increase (decrease) (1.1 ) 403.8 (8.9 ) 61.2 $ 20.2 434.8 Percentage increase (decrease) (0.5 %) (261.4 %) (3.4 %) N/M 25.4 % 173.2 % N/M Not meaningful (1) The operating results of Apptis have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on June 1, 2011. (2) The operating results of Flint have been included in our consolidated results since the acquisition on May 14, 2012. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for the year ended December 28, 2012 was 6.3% compared to 2.6% for the year ended December 30, 2011. The increase in operating income in fiscal year 2012 relative to the corresponding period of 2011 was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 30, 2011. In addition, operating income increased due to the inclusion of operating income resulting from the acquisition of Flint and an increase in net performance based incentive fees from work, performed by our Federal Services Division, managing chemical demilitarization programs in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in operating income resulting from the wind down and completion of projects, and delayed awards of new task orders. See the detailed discussion of operating income by segment below. The Infrastructure & Environment Divisions Operating Income Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 5.8% for the year ended December 28, 2012 compared to 5.9% for the year ended December 30, 2011. The change in operating income was primarily attributable to our contract mix, which in 2012, utilized more subcontractors with higher associated costs. The increase in subcontract costs was partially offset by higher revenues and decreases in employee benefits and other indirect costs. Overhead costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to 31.1% for the year ended December 28, 2012 from 32.0% for the year ended December 30, 2011. The Federal Services Divisions Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenues was 9.2% for the year ended December 28, 2012 compared to (5.7)% for the year ended December 30, 2011. For the year ended December 30, 2011, the operating loss was the result of a $351.3 million goodwill impairment charge. Operating income included a $75.7 million increase in net performance based incentive fees from work managing chemical demilitarization programs recognized in the current year compared to the prior year. This increase included $40.0 million related to a programmatic schedule incentive fee achieved when multiple chemical demilitarization contracts each met its milestones in 2012. This increase was partially offset by delayed awards of new task orders under existing contracts and lower margins on federal operations and support services contracts due to low price, technically acceptable contracting strategies, which emphasize price over qualitative factors, such as past performance. The Energy & Construction Divisions Operating Income Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 8.1% for the year ended December 28, 2012 compared to 8.1% for the year ended December 30, 2011. The slight decrease in operating income was due to the $29.1 million decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures described above, and a $31.5 million decline resulting from the substantial completion of a levee construction project in New Orleans in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $22.8 million, consisting of a $3.4 million current year insurance recovery compared to a prior year loss of $19.4 million on a common sulfur project and an increase of $20.6 million on a new air quality control project. 65 The Oil & Gas Divisions Operating Income The Oil & Gas Divisions operating income for the year ended December 28, 2012 was $61.2 million, which reflects activities from May 14, 2012, the effective date of the Flint acquisition and includes $38.6 million of amortization of intangible assets in connection with the Flint acquisition. Interest Expense Our consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 28, 2012 increased by $48.6 million or 219.9% compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. This increase was primarily due to the interest expense incurred on the additional borrowings and the assumption of debt in connection with the Flint acquisition. Other Income, Net Our consolidated other income, net for the year ended December 28, 2012 represents a foreign currency gain of $0.8 million recognized on intercompany financing arrangements and a net loss of $0.3 million recognized on foreign currency forward contracts. Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rates for the years ended December 28, 2012 and December 30, 2011 were 30.8% and 62.6%, respectively. The change in effective income tax rates was primarily due to the non deductibility of a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge taken in 2011. Noncontrolling Interests in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries Our noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased by $13.3 million or 10.4% in the year ended December 28, 2012 compared with the year ended December 30, 2011. The decrease in noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries, net of tax was primarily due to lower earnings from one of our U.K. joint ventures, the substantial completion of a levee construction project in New Orleans in the prior year, and lower earnings from certain DOE nuclear cleanup projects. These decreases were partially offset by increases related to higher activity at air quality control services projects and steam generator replacement projects performed through consolidated joint ventures. 66 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Year Ended January 3, December 28, December 30, (In millions) 2014 2012 2011 Cash flows from operating activities $ 614.2 $ 430.2 $ 505.9 Cash flows from investing activities (13.2 ) (1,446.6 ) (348.1 ) Cash flows from financing activities (630.5 ) 892.3 (294.3 ) Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are collections of accounts receivable from our clients, dividends from our unconsolidated joint ventures and borrowings related to our lines of credit. Our primary uses of cash are to fund working capital, income tax payments, and capital expenditures; to service our debt; to pay dividends; to repurchase our common stock; and to make distributions to the minority owners in our consolidated joint ventures. Our cash flows from operations are primarily impacted by fluctuations in working capital requirements, which are affected by numerous factors, including the billing and payment terms of our contracts, the stage of completion of contracts performed by us, the timing of payments to vendors, subcontractors, and joint ventures, and the changes in income tax and interest payments, as well as unforeseen events or issues that may have an impact on our working capital. Our future capital allocation priorities are expected to include dividend payments, share repurchases, debt pay downs, add on acquisitions and organic growth opportunities. Liquidity Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase, including interest bearing bank deposits and money market funds. At January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, restricted cash was $12.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively, which amounts were included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.8 million and $116.3 million, respectively, held outside the U.S., excluding amounts in consolidated joint ventures. We are not aware of any material restrictions on cash and cash equivalents in those countries outside the U.S where we conduct business. If cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds; however, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these foreign amounts outside of the U.S., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund our U.S. operations. In addition, as of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, our consolidated joint ventures held cash and cash equivalents of $89.4 million and $80.1 million, respectively. These amounts are restricted for use by each joint venture and are not available for use in our general operations. 67 Accounts receivable and costs and accrued earnings in excess of billings on contracts (also referred to as Unbilled Accounts Receivable) represent one of our primary sources of cash inflows from operations. Unbilled Accounts Receivable represent amounts that will be billed to clients as soon as invoice support can be assembled, reviewed and provided to our clients, or when specific contractual billing milestones are achieved. In some cases, Unbilled Accounts Receivable may not be billable for periods generally extending from two to six months and, occasionally, beyond a year. As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, $131.1 million and $264.9 million, respectively, of Unbilled Accounts Receivable were not expected to become billable within twelve months of the balance sheet date and, as a result, are included as a component of Other long term assets. As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, we reclassified unbilled amounts representing performance based incentive fees from our work managing chemical demilitarization and nuclear management and decommissioning programs from Other long term assets to Unbilled Accounts Receivable because we expect them to become billable within twelve months of the Balance Sheet date. We are required contractually to share a portion of these incentive fees with our employees and subcontractors for some of our projects. These liabilities are accrued concurrently with the related receivables and are not expected to be paid until after the fees are collected, and, as a result, are originally included as a component of Other long term liabilities. As the underlying performance based incentive fee receivables become current, these incentive fees are reclassified from Other long term liabilities to Other current liabilities. The following table summarizes the activities of Unbilled Accounts Receivable included in Other long term assets and the corresponding liabilities included in Other long term liabilities for our fiscal years 2013 and 2012: (In millions) Amounts included in Other long term assets Amounts included in Other long term liabilities" Balances as of December 30, 2011 $ 185.0 $ 105.6 Additions 209.2 38.9 Reclassification from long term to short term (129.3 ) (37.5 ) Balances as of December 28, 2012 264.9 107.0 Additions 241.7 59.7 Reclassification from long term to short term (375.5 ) (164.5 ) Balances as of January 3, 2014 $ 131.1 $ 2.2 As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, significant unapproved change orders and claims, which are included in Unbilled Accounts Receivable, collectively represented approximately 4% and 3%, respectively, of our gross accounts receivable and Unbilled Accounts Receivable. Net accounts receivable, which is comprised of accounts receivable and the current portion of Unbilled Accounts Receivable, net of receivable allowances, at January 3, 2014 was $2.8 billion, essentially flat compared to the balance as of December 28, 2012. Our accounts receivable and Unbilled Accounts Receivable are evaluated on a regular basis to assess the risk of collectability, and allowances are provided as deemed appropriate. Based on the nature of our customer base, including U.S. federal, state and local governments and large reputable companies, and contracts, we have not historically experienced significant write offs related to receivables and Unbilled Accounts Receivable. The size of our allowance for uncollectible receivables as a percentage of the combined totals of our accounts receivable and Unbilled Accounts Receivable is indicative of our history of successfully billing and collecting from our clients. 68 As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, our receivable allowances represented 2.23% and 2.37%, respectively, of the combined total accounts receivable and the current portion of Unbilled Accounts Receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as of January 3, 2014 is adequate. We have placed significant emphasis on collection efforts and continually monitor our receivables allowance. However, future economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of some of our clients to make payments or the timeliness of their payments; consequently, it may also affect our ability to consistently collect cash from our clients to meet our operating needs. The other significant factors that typically affect the timing of the realization of our accounts receivable include the billing and payment terms of our contracts, as well as the stage of completion of our performance under the contracts. Our operating cash flows may also be affected by changes in contract terms or the timing of advance payments to our joint ventures, partnerships and partially owned limited liability companies relative to the contract collection cycle. In addition, substantial advance payments or billings in excess of costs also have an impact on our liquidity. Billings in excess of costs as of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012 were $233.1 million and $289.1 million, respectively. We use Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) to monitor the average time, in days, that it takes us to convert our accounts receivable into cash. DSO also is a useful tool for investors to measure our liquidity and understand our average collection period. We calculate DSO by dividing net accounts receivable, less billings in excess of costs and accrued earnings on contracts, as of the end of the quarter by the amount of revenues recognized during the quarter, and multiplying the result of that calculation by the number of days in that quarter. We included the non current amounts in our calculation of DSO and the ratio of accounts receivable to revenues. Our DSO increased from 87 days as of December 28, 2012 to 101 days as of January 3, 2014. We also analyze the ratio of our accounts receivable to quarterly revenues (the Ratio), which changed from 95.7% at December 28, 2012 to 103.2% at January 3, 2014. We calculate this ratio by dividing net accounts receivable, less billings in excess of costs and accrued earnings on contracts as of the end of the quarter by the amount of revenues recognized during the quarter. The factors that affect the Ratio also have the same effect on DSO. The increases in the Ratio, and therefore the increases in DSO, occurred primarily for the following reasons: Accruals of amounts from performance based incentives under long term U.S. federal government contracts, primarily with the DOD, composed 6.4% of our Ratio for the quarter ended December 28, 2012 and 10.9% of our Ratio for the quarter ended January 3, 2014. These amounts were included in Unbilled Accounts Receivable and Other long term assets, and they become billable as provided under the terms of the contracts to which they relate. We expect to bill for these incentives beginning in 2014 and beyond. Our Unbilled Accounts Receivable and Other long term assets included amounts earned under milestone payment clauses, which provided for payments to be received beyond a year from the date service occurs. Based on our historical experience, we generally consider the collection risk related to these amounts to be low. Our Ratio was also impacted by an increase in accounts receivable related to activity on a DOE deactivation, demolition, and removal project, which added 0.9% to our Ratio for the quarter ended December 28, 2012, and 3.4% to our Ratio for the quarter ended January 3, 2014. Our Ratio was also impacted due to the completion of projects involving the replacement of steam generators at nuclear power plants in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, whereas these projects had a favorable impact of 2.7% to the Ratio in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. Excluding the significant changes discussed above, our Ratios were 88.9% and 90.8% for the quarters ended January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, respectively. We believe that we have sufficient resources to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements, to pay income taxes, and to service our debt for at least the next twelve months. In the ordinary course of our business, we may experience various loss contingencies including, but not limited to, the pending legal proceedings identified in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report, which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. We have determined that the restricted net assets as defined by Rule 4 08(e)(3) of Regulation S X are less than 25% of our consolidated net assets. 69 Credit Facility, Senior Notes and Canadian Notes On December 19, 2013, we entered into an amendment to our 2011 Credit Facility that extended the maturity date by two years to December 19, 2018, increased the sublimit for alternative currency revolving loans from $400.0 million to $500.0 million, established a $500.0 million sublimit for financial letters of credit, and increased a restricted payment basket from $150 million to $200 million in any fiscal year. On March 15, 2012, we issued in a private placement $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% Senior Notes due on April 1, 2017 and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due on April 1, 2022 (collectively, the Senior Notes). We used the net proceeds from the notes together with borrowings from our 2011 Credit Facility to finance our acquisition of Flint on May 14, 2012. On January 3, 2014, our exchange offer expired and we exchanged substantially all of the privately placed Senior Notes for Senior Notes that are registered with the SEC. On December 27, 2013, Flint redeemed all of its outstanding 7.5% senior notes (Canadian Notes). See Note 11, Indebtedness, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this report, for more information. Dividend Program Our Board of Directors has declared the following dividends: Declaration Date Dividend Per Share Record Date Total Maximum Payment Payment Date (In millions, except per share data) February 24, 2012 $ 0.20 March 16, 2012 $ 15.2 April 6, 2012 May 4, 2012 $ 0.20 June 15, 2012 $ 15.4 July 6, 2012 August 3, 2012 $ 0.20 September 14, 2012 $ 15.4 October 5, 2012 November 2, 2012 $ 0.20 December 14, 2012 $ 15.4 January 4, 2013 February 22, 2013 $ 0.21 March 15, 2013 $ 16.0 April 5, 2013 May 3, 2013 $ 0.21 June 14, 2013 $ 16.0 July 5, 2013 August 2, 2013 $ 0.21 September 13, 2013 $ 16.0 October 4, 2013 November 1, 2013 $ 0.21 December 13, 2013 $ 16.0 January 10, 2014 February 28, 2014 $ 0.22 March 21, 2014 NA April 11, 2014 NA Not available On February 28, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the continuation of this program and authorized a $0.22 per share quarterly dividend. Future dividends are subject to approval by our Board of Directors or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Operating Activities The increase in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended January 3, 2014, compared to the year ended December 28, 2012, was primarily due to the timing of billing, collections and advance payments from clients on accounts receivable, income tax payments, and dividend distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase was partially offset by the timing of vendor and subcontractor payments, and salary and employee benefit payments. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 28, 2012, compared to the year ended December 30, 2011, was primarily due to the timing of billings, collections and advance payments from clients on accounts receivables, employer contribution payments to our 401(k) plan, project incentive awards that were recognized but are not currently billable, and an increase in interest payments and acquisition expenses, partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments. During the first quarter of 2014, we expect to make estimated payments of $102 million to pension, post retirement, defined contribution and multiemployer pension plans and incentive payments. 70 Investing Activities Cash flows used for investing activities of $13.2 million during the year ended January 3, 2014 consisted of the following significant activities: capital expenditures, excluding purchases financed through capital leases and equipment notes, of $81.0 million. These cash flows were partially offset by: proceeds from disposal of property and equipment of $63.7 million, mainly resulting from the sale of equipment, land, and buildings in Canada. Cash flows used for investing activities of $1.4 billion during the year ended December 28, 2012 consisted of the following significant activities: payments for business acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures, excluding purchases financed through capital leases and equipment notes, of $125.4 million. These cash flows were partially offset by: proceeds from disposal of property and equipment of $25.3 million, including the residual payment received on the close out and settlement of mining projects in Jamaica. Cash flows used for investing activities of $348.1 million during the year ended December 30, 2011 consisted of the following significant activities: payments for business acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $282.1 million; capital expenditures, excluding purchases financed through capital leases and equipment notes, of $67.5 million; and disbursements related to advances to unconsolidated joint ventures of $19.6 million. For fiscal year 2014, we expect to incur approximately $75 million to $85 million in capital expenditures, a portion of which will be financed through capital leases or equipment notes. 71 Financing Activities Cash flows used for financing activities of $630.5 million during the year ended January 3, 2014 consisted of the following significant activities: long term debt payments of $220.5 million; net payments to our revolving line of credit of $95.9 million; repurchases of our common stock of $93.3 million; distributions to noncontrolling interests of consolidated joint ventures of $79.0 million; dividend payments of $62.2 million; and net change in overdrafts of $54.9 million. Cash flows generated from financing activities of $892.3 million during the year ended December 28, 2012 consisted of the following significant activities: proceeds of our Senior Notes, net of debt discount and issuance costs, of $990.1 million; net borrowings from our revolving line of credit of $78.0 million; and net change in overdrafts of $54.5 million. These cash flows were partially offset by: distributions to noncontrolling interests of consolidated joint ventures of $83.8 million; dividend payments of $44.7 million; repurchases of our common stock of $40.0 million; and payment of $30.0 million of the term loan under our 2011 Credit Facility. Cash flows used for financing activities of $294.3 million during the year ended December 30, 2011 consisted of the following significant activities: payment of all outstanding indebtedness under our 2007 senior secured credit facility, which included outstanding term loans of $625.0 million and a drawn balance on our revolving line of credit in the amount of $50.0 million; repurchases of our common stock of $242.8 million; distributions to noncontrolling interests of consolidated joint ventures of $111.7 million; and net change in overdrafts of $18.0 million. These cash flows were partially offset by: a term loan borrowing from our 2011 Credit Facility of $700.0 million; and net borrowings from our revolving line of credit of $72.9 million under our 2011 Credit Facility. 72 Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table contains information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 3, 2014: Contractual Obligations Payments and Commitments Due by Period Less Than After (In millions) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Other As of January 3, 2014: 2011 Credit Facility (1) $ 605.0 $ $ 54.1 $ 550.9 $ $ 3.85% Senior Notes (2) 400.0 400.0 5.00% Senior Notes (2) 600.0 600.0 Capital lease obligations (3) 43.5 19.8 19.6 4.1 Notes payable, foreign credit lines and other indebtedness 67.1 25.5 23.0 12.9 5.7 Total debt (principal only) 1,715.6 45.3 96.7 967.9 605.7 Operating lease obligations (3) 742.1 187.1 276.9 162.8 115.3 Pension and other retirement plans funding requirements (4) 437.4 235.4 64.7 58.4 78.9 Interest (5) 417.7 68.3 136.1 108.3 105.0 Dividends payable (6) 18.3 16.7 1.5 0.1 Purchase obligations (7) 10.4 6.3 4.1 Asset retirement obligations (8) 14.9 3.0 2.1 3.8 6.0 Other contractual obligations (9) 230.4 216.8 2.2 11.4 Total contractual obligations $ 3,586.8 $ 778.9 $ 584.3 $ 1,301.3 $ 910.9 $ 11.4 (1) Amounts shown exclude unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.2 million for our 2011 Credit Facility. For information regarding events that could accelerate the due dates of these payments, see the 2011 Credit Facility section below. (2) Amounts shown exclude unamortized discount for the 3.85% and 5.00% Senior Notes of $0.9 million. For information regarding events that could accelerate these payments, see the Senior Notes and Canadian Notes below. (3) For capital lease obligations, amounts shown exclude interest of $1.6 million. Operating leases are predominantly real estate leases. (4) Amounts consist of estimated pension and other retirement plan funding requirements, to the extent that we were able to develop reasonable estimates, for various defined benefit, post retirement, defined contribution, multiemployer, and other retirement plans. Estimates do not include potential multiemployer plan termination or withdrawal amounts since we are unable to estimate the amount of contributions that could be required. (5) Interest for the next five years, which excludes non cash interest, is determined based on the current outstanding balance of our debt and payment schedule at the estimated interest rate. (6) Dividends for unvested restricted stock awards and units will be paid upon vesting. (7) Purchase obligations consist primarily of software maintenance contracts. (8) Asset retirement obligations represent the estimated costs of removing and restoring our leased properties to the original condition pursuant to our real estate lease agreements. (9) Other contractual obligations include accrued performance based incentive fees shared with our employees and subcontractors, project and retention bonuses, anticipated settlements and interest on our tax liabilities, accrued benefits for our executives pursuant to their employment agreements, and our contractual obligations to joint ventures. Generally, it is not practicable to forecast or estimate the payment dates for the above mentioned tax liabilities. Therefore, we included the estimated liabilities under Other above. 73 Off balance Sheet Arrangements In the ordinary course of business, we may use off balance sheet arrangements if we believe that such an arrangement would be an efficient way to lower our cost of capital or help us manage the overall risks of our business operations. We do not believe that such arrangements have had a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations. The following are our off balance sheet arrangements: Letters of credit and bank guarantees are used primarily to support project performance, insurance programs, bonding arrangements and real estate leases. We are required to reimburse the issuers of letters of credit and bank guarantees for any payments they make under the outstanding letters of credit or bank guarantees. Our credit facilities and banking arrangements cover the issuance of our standby letters of credit and bank guarantees that are critical for our normal operations. If we default on these credit facilities and banking arrangements, we would be unable to issue or renew standby letters of credit and bank guarantees, which would impair our ability to maintain normal operations. As of January 3, 2014, we had $108.3 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under our 2011 Credit Facility and $35.8 million in bank guarantees outstanding under foreign credit facilities and other banking arrangements with remaining availability of approximately $39.0 million. We have agreed to indemnify one of our joint venture partners up to $25.0 million for any potential losses, damages, and liabilities associated with lawsuits in relation to general and administrative services we provide to the joint venture. Currently, we have not been advised of any indemnified claims under this guarantee. From time to time, we provide guarantees and indemnifications related to our services or work. If our services under a guaranteed or indemnified project are later determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency, then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies. When sufficient information about claims on guaranteed or indemnified projects is available and monetary damages or other costs or losses are determined to be probable, we recognize such guarantee losses. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various agreements providing performance assurances and guarantees to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures, and other jointly executed contracts. We enter into these agreements primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is typically the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. However, the majority of the unconsolidated joint ventures in which we participate involve cost reimbursable, level of effort projects that are accounted for as service type projects, not engineering and construction projects that would follow the percentage of completion or completed contract accounting method. Revenues for service type contracts are recognized in proportion to the number of service activities performed, in proportion to the direct costs of performing the service activities, or evenly across the period of performance, depending upon the nature of the services provided. The services we provide on these cost reimbursable contracts are management and operations services for government clients and operations and maintenance services for non government clients. We believe that, due to the continual changes we experience in client funding and scope definitions, reliable estimates of performance guarantees cannot be calculated because they cannot be reliably predicted. In addition, the level at which we participate in joint ventures does not afford us access to those joint ventures estimates to complete. The joint ventures with regard to which we perform engineering and construction contracts and where we have access to the estimates to complete, which are needed to calculate the performance guarantees, are immaterial. For cost plus contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, we may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors, for claims. 74 In the ordinary course of business, our clients may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made thereunder. Each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of our related contractual obligation. 2011 Credit Facility As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, the outstanding balances of the term loan under our 2011 Credit Facility were $605.0 million and $670.0 million, respectively. As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, the interest rates applicable to the term loan were 1.67% and 1.71%, respectively. Loans outstanding under our 2011 Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at the base rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus, in each case, an applicable per annum margin. The applicable margin is determined based on the better of our debt ratings or our leverage ratio in accordance with a pricing grid. The interest rate at which we normally borrow is LIBOR plus 150 basis points. On December 19, 2013, we entered into an amendment to our 2011 Credit Facility that extended the maturity date by two years to December 19, 2018, increased the sublimit for alternative currency revolving loans from $400.0 million to $500.0 million, established a $500.0 million sublimit for financial letters of credit, and increased a restricted payment basket from $150 million to $200 million in any fiscal year. We have an option to prepay the term loans at any time without penalty. Under our 2011 Credit Facility, we are subject to financial covenants and other customary non financial covenants. Our financial covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing total debt by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined below, and a minimum interest coverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing cash interest expense into EBITDA. Both calculations are based on the financial data of our most recent four fiscal quarters. For purposes of our 2011 Credit Facility, consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income attributable to URS plus interest, depreciation and amortization expense, income tax expense, and other non cash items (including impairments of goodwill or intangible assets). Consolidated EBITDA shall include pro forma components of EBITDA attributable to any permitted acquisition consummated during the period of calculation. Our 2011 Credit Facility contains restrictions, some of which apply only above specific thresholds, regarding indebtedness, liens, investments and acquisitions, contingent obligations, dividend payments, stock repurchases, asset sales, fundamental business changes, transactions with affiliates, and changes in fiscal year. Our 2011 Credit Facility identifies various events of default and provides for acceleration of the obligations and exercise of other enforcement remedies upon default. Events of default include our failure to make payments under the credit facility; cross defaults; a breach of financial, affirmative and negative covenants; a breach of representations and warranties; bankruptcy and other insolvency events; the existence of unsatisfied judgments and attachments; dissolution; other events relating to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; a change in control and invalidity of loan documents. Our 2011 Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries that, on an individual basis, represent more than 10% of either our consolidated domestic assets or consolidated domestic revenues. If necessary, additional domestic subsidiaries will be included so that assets and revenues of subsidiary guarantors are equal at all times to at least 80% of our consolidated domestic assets and consolidated domestic revenues of our available domestic subsidiaries. We may use any future borrowings from our 2011 Credit Facility along with operating cash flows for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital, making capital expenditures, funding acquisitions, paying dividends and repurchasing our common stock. We were in compliance with the covenants of our 2011 Credit Facility as of January 3, 2014. 75 Senior Notes and Canadian Notes On March 15, 2012, we issued, in a private placement, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% Senior Notes due on April 1, 2017 and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due on April 1, 2022. On January 3, 2014, our exchange offer expired and we exchanged substantially all of the privately placed Senior Notes with Senior Notes that are registered with the SEC. As of January 3, 2014, the outstanding balance of the Senior Notes was $999.1 million, net of $0.9 million of discount. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning on October 1, 2012. The net proceeds of the Senior Notes were used to fund the acquisition of Flint. We may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a "make whole" premium and accrued and unpaid interest as described in the indenture. In addition, we may redeem all or a portion of the 5.00% Senior Notes at any time on or after the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of those 5.00% Senior Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.00% Senior Notes to be redeemed. We may also, at our option, redeem the Senior Notes, in whole, at 100% of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain events that result in an obligation to pay additional amounts as a result of certain specified changes in tax law described in the indenture. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined by the terms of the indenture, we will be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the purchase. We are generally not limited under the indenture governing the Senior Notes in our ability to incur additional indebtedness provided we are in compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on liens and restrictions on sale and leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of substantially all of our property and assets. The Senior Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with our other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the Guarantees) by each of our current and future domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors under our 2011 Credit Facility or that are wholly owned domestic obligors or wholly owned domestic guarantors, individually or collectively, under any future indebtedness of our subsidiaries in excess of $100.0 million (the Guarantors). The Guarantees are the Guarantors unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with the Guarantors other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. See Note 18, Condensed Consolidating Financial Information, to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report for additional detail. On May 14, 2012, we guaranteed the Canadian Notes with an outstanding face value of C$175.0 million (US$175.0 million). On December 27, 2013, Flint redeemed all of its outstanding Canadian Notes. We recorded in Interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended January 3, 2014 a net gain of $4.1 million, comprised of premium write off of $23.2 million that was offset by a prepayment fee of $19.1 million related to the redemption of Canadian Notes. As of December 28, 2012, the outstanding balance of the Canadian Notes was $203.8 million, including $28.0 million of premium. We were in compliance with the covenants of our Senior Notes as of January 3, 2014. 76 Revolving Line of Credit Our revolving line of credit is used to fund daily operating cash needs and to support our standby letters of credit. In the ordinary course of business, the use of our revolving line of credit is a function of collection and disbursement activities. Our daily cash needs generally follow a predictable pattern that parallels our payroll cycles, which dictate, as necessary, our short term borrowing requirements. We had no outstanding debt balances on our revolving line of credit as of January 3, 2014. We had outstanding debt balances of $100.5 million on our revolving line of credit as of December 28, 2012. As of January 3, 2014, we had issued $108.3 million of letters of credit, leaving $891.7 million available under our revolving credit facility. A summary of information regarding our revolving line of credit is set forth below: Year Ended January 3, December 28, (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2012 Effective average interest rates on the revolving line of credit 2.4 % 1.9 % Average daily revolving line of credit balances $ 135.2 $ 139.5 Maximum amounts outstanding at any point during the year $ 236.4 $ 420.0 Other Indebtedness Notes payable, five year loan notes, and foreign credit lines. As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, we had outstanding amounts of $67.1 million and $35.5 million, respectively, in notes payable, five year loan notes, and foreign lines of credit. The weighted average interest rates of the notes were approximately 3.57% and 4.68% as of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, respectively. Notes payable primarily include notes used to finance the purchase of office equipment, computer equipment, furniture, vehicles and automotive equipment, and construction equipment. As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, we maintained several foreign credit lines with aggregate borrowing capacity of $51.3 million and $50.8 million, respectively, and had remaining borrowing capacity of $49.0 and $47.7 million, respectively. Capital Leases. As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, we had obligations under our capital leases of approximately $43.5 million and $59.2 million, respectively, consisting primarily of leases for office equipment, computer equipment, furniture, vehicles and automotive equipment, and construction equipment. Operating Leases. As of January 3, 2014 and December 28, 2012, we had obligations under our operating leases of approximately $742.1 million and $706.3 million, respectively, consisting primarily of real estate leases. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax for the year ended January 3, 2014 was comprised of pension and post retirement adjustments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The 2013 pension and post retirement adjustment of $17.0 million, net of tax, was caused primarily by an increase in the inflation rate assumption in the international benefit plans, which was partially offset by an increase in the discount rate assumption for the domestic benefit plans. The 2013 foreign currency translation loss of $70.2 million resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. See Note 19, Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included under Item 8 of this report for more disclosure about our other comprehensive income (loss). 77 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain accounting policies that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in Item 8 of this report. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts, after considering materiality. Application of these accounting policies, however, involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. Consequently, actual results could differ from our estimates, and these differences could be material. The following are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to an investors understanding of our financial results and condition and that require complex judgments by management. There were no material changes to these critical accounting policies during the year ended January 3, 2014. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities We participate in joint ventures, which include partnerships and partially owned limited liability companies, to bid, negotiate and complete specific projects. We are required to consolidate these joint ventures if we hold the majority voting interest or if the joint venture is determined to be a variable interest entity (VIE) and we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. We are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, we take into consideration the following: Identifying the significant activities and the parties that have the power to direct them; Reviewing the governing board composition and participation ratio; Determining the equity, profit and loss ratio; Determining the management sharing ratio; Reviewing employment terms, including which joint venture partner provides the project manager; and Reviewing the funding and operating agreements. Examples of significant activities include the following: Program and project management; Engineering services; Procurement services; Construction; Construction management; and Operations and maintenance services. Based on the above, if we determine that the power to direct the significant activities is shared by two or more joint venture parties, then there is no primary beneficiary and no party consolidates the VIE. In making the shared power determination, we analyze the key contractual terms, governance, related party and de facto agency as they are defined in the accounting standard, and other arrangements to determine if the shared power exists. As required by the accounting standard, we perform a quarterly re assessment to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. This evaluation may result in consolidation of a previously unconsolidated joint venture or in deconsolidation of a previously consolidated joint venture. See Note 6, Joint Ventures, for further information on our VIEs. 78 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues from engineering, construction and construction related contracts using the percentage of completion method as project progress occurs. Service related contracts, including operations and maintenance services and a variety of technical assistance services, are accounted for using the proportionate performance method as project progress occurs. Percentage of Completion. Under the percentage of completion method, revenue is recognized as contract performance progresses. We estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize. We generally utilize a cost to cost approach in applying the percentage of completion method, where revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred, divided by total costs expected to be incurred. Costs are generally determined from actual hours of labor effort expended at per hour labor rates calculated using a labor dollar multiplier that includes direct labor costs and allocable overhead costs. Direct non labor costs are charged as incurred plus any mark up permitted under the contract. Under the percentage of completion method, recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates, including engineering progress, materials quantities, and achievement of milestones, incentives, penalty provisions, labor productivity, cost estimates and others. Such estimates are based on various professional judgments we make with respect to those factors and are subject to change as the project proceeds and new information becomes available. Proportional Performance. Our service contracts are accounted for using the proportional performance method, under which revenue is recognized in proportion to the number of service activities performed, in proportion to the direct costs of performing the service activities, or evenly across the period of performance depending upon the nature of the services provided. Revenues from all contracts may vary based on the actual number of labor hours worked and other actual contract costs incurred. If actual labor hours and other contract costs exceed the original estimate agreed to by our client, we generally obtain a change order, contract modification or successfully prevail in a claim in order to receive and recognize additional revenues relating to the additional costs (see Change Orders and Claims below). If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss becomes known. The cumulative effect of revisions to revenue, estimated costs to complete contracts, including penalties, incentive awards, change orders, claims, anticipated losses, and others are recorded in the accounting period in which the events indicating a loss or change in estimates are known and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur at any time and the effects may be material. We have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion, contract revenue and contract completion costs on our long term engineering and construction contracts. However, due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates. Change Orders and Claims. Change orders and or claims occur when changes are experienced once contract performance is underway, and may arise under any of the contract types described below. Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract. Change orders may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work. Either we or our clients may initiate change orders. Client agreement as to the terms of change orders is, in many cases, reached prior to work commencing; however, sometimes circumstances require that work progress without obtaining client agreement. Costs related to change orders are recognized as incurred. Revenues attributable to change orders that are unapproved as to price or scope are recognized to the extent that costs have been incurred if the amounts can be reliably estimated and their realization is probable. Revenues in excess of the costs attributable to change orders that are unapproved as to price or scope are recognized only when realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt. Change orders that are unapproved as to both price and scope are evaluated as claims. 79 Claims are amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that we seek to collect from our clients or others for customer caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs. Claims are included in total estimated contract revenues when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, when the additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies in the contract performance, when the costs associated with the claim are identifiable, and when the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable. Revenue on claims is recognized only to the extent that contract costs related to the claims have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in a bona fide addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on claims until final settlement occurs. As a result, costs may be recognized in one period while revenues may be recognized when client agreement is obtained or claims resolution occurs, which can be in subsequent periods. At risk and Agency Contracts. The amount of revenues we recognize also depends on whether the contract or project represents an at risk or an agency relationship between the client and us. Determination of the relationship is based on characteristics of the contract or the relationship with the client. For at risk relationships where we act as the principal to the transaction, the revenue and the costs of materials, services, payroll, benefits, and other costs are recognized at gross amounts. For agency relationships, where we act as an agent for our client, only the fee revenue is recognized, meaning that direct project costs and the related reimbursement from the client are netted. Revenues from agency contracts and collaborative arrangements were not a material part of revenues for any period presented. In classifying contracts or projects as either at risk or agency, we consider the following primary characteristics to be indicative of at risk relationships: (i) we acquire the related goods and services using our procurement resources, (ii) we assume the risk of loss under the contract and (iii) we are responsible for insurance coverage, employee related liabilities and the performance of subcontractors. We consider the following primary characteristics to be indicative of agency relationships: (i) our client owns the work facilities utilized under the contract, (ii) we act as a procurement agent for goods and services acquired with client funds, (iii) our client is invoiced for our fees, (iv) our client is exposed to the risk of loss and maintains insurance coverage, and (v) our client is responsible for employee related benefit plan liabilities and any remaining liabilities at the end of the contract. Contract Types Our contract types include cost plus, target price, fixed price, and time and materials contracts. Revenue recognition is determined based on the nature of the service provided, irrespective of the contract type, with engineering, construction and construction related contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method and service related contracts accounted for under the proportional performance method. Cost Plus Contracts. We enter into four major types of cost plus contracts. Revenue for the majority of our cost plus contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method: Cost Plus Fixed Fee. Under cost plus fixed fee contracts, we charge our clients for our costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a fixed negotiated fee. Cost Plus Fixed Rate. Under our cost plus fixed rate contracts, we charge clients for our direct costs plus negotiated rates based on our indirect costs. Cost Plus Award Fee. Some cost plus contracts provide for award fees or penalties based on performance criteria in lieu of a fixed fee or fixed rate. Other contracts include a base fee component plus a performance based award fee. In addition, we may share award fees with subcontractors and or our employees. We accrue fee sharing on a monthly basis as related award fee revenue is earned. We take into consideration the award fee or penalty on contracts when estimating revenues and profit rates, and we record revenues related to the award fees when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. On contracts that represent higher than normal risk or technical difficulty, we defer all award fees until an award fee letter is received. Once an award fee letter is received, the estimated or accrued fees are adjusted to the actual award amount. 80 Cost Plus Incentive Fee. Some of our cost plus contracts provide for incentive fees based on performance against contractual milestones. The amount of the incentive fees vary, depending on whether we achieve above , at or below target results. We recognize incentive fees revenues as milestones are achieved, assuming that we will achieve at target results, unless our estimates indicate our cost at completion to be significantly above or below target. Target Price Contracts. Under our target price contracts, project costs are reimbursable. Our fee is established against a target budget that is subject to changes in project circumstances and scope. Should the project costs exceed the target budget within the agreed upon scope, we generally degrade a portion of our fee or profit to mitigate the excess cost; however, the customer reimburses us for the costs that we incur if costs continue to escalate beyond our expected fee. If the project costs are less than the target budget, we generally recover a portion of the project cost savings as additional fee or profit. We recognize revenues on target price contracts using the percentage of completion method. Fixed Price Contracts. We enter into two major types of fixed price contracts: Firm Fixed Price (FFP). Under FFP contracts, our clients pay us an agreed fixed amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work. We generally recognize revenues on FFP contracts using the percentage of completion method. If the nature or circumstances of the contract prevent us from preparing a reliable estimate at completion, we will delay profit recognition until adequate information about the contracts progress becomes available. Prior to completion, our recognized profit margins on any FFP contract depend on the accuracy of our estimates and will increase to the extent that our current estimates of aggregate actual costs are below amounts previously estimated. Conversely, if our current estimated costs exceed prior estimates, our profit margins will decrease and we may realize a loss on a project. Fixed Price Per Unit (FPPU). Under our FPPU contracts, clients pay us a set fee for each service or production transaction that we complete. We recognize revenues under FPPU contracts as we complete the related service or production transactions for our clients generally using the proportional performance method. Some of our FPPU contracts are subject to maximum contract values. Time and Materials Contracts. Under our time and materials contracts, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based on the actual time that we spend on a project. In addition, clients reimburse us for our actual out of pocket costs of materials and other direct incidental expenditures that we incur in connection with our performance under the contract. The majority of our time and material contracts are subject to maximum contract values and, accordingly, revenues under these contracts are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method. However, time and materials contracts that are service related contracts are accounted for utilizing the proportional performance method. Revenues on contracts that are not subject to maximum contract values are recognized based on the actual number of hours we spend on the projects plus any actual out of pocket costs of materials and other direct incidental expenditures that we incur on the projects. Our time and materials contracts also generally include annual billing rate adjustment provisions. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Review We amortize our intangible assets based on the period over which the contractual or economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be realized. We assess our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill was allocated to the reporting units based on the respective fair values of the reporting units at the time of the various acquisitions that gave rise to the recognition of goodwill. We assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of the end of the first month following our September reporting period or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. 81 We believe the methodology that we use to review impairment of goodwill, which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provides us with a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred. However, many of the factors employed in determining whether our goodwill is impaired are outside of our control, and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. These changes could result in future impairments. Goodwill impairment reviews involve a two step process. The first step is a comparison of each reporting units fair value to its carrying value. We estimate fair value using both the income approach and the market approach. The fair value measurements from the income approach are calculated using unobservable inputs to our discounted cash flows. The income approach uses a reporting units projection of estimated cash flows and discounts those back to the present using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions. To arrive at the cash flow projections used in the calculation of fair values for our goodwill impairment review, we use market participant estimates of economic and market activity for the next ten years. The key assumptions we used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units were: Revenue growth rates; Operating margins; Capital expenditure needs; Working capital requirements; Discount rates; and Terminal value capitalization rate (Capitalization Rate) We also make assumptions about future market conditions, market prices, interest rates, and changes in business strategies. Changes in our assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and, therefore, could eliminate the excess fair value over the carrying value of a reporting unit entirely and, in some cases, could result in impairment. Such changes in assumptions could be caused by a loss of one or more significant contracts, reductions in government and or private industry spending, including federal government sequestration, or a decline in the demand of our services due to changing economic conditions. Given the contractual nature of our business, if we are unable to win or renew contracts; are unable to estimate and control our contract costs; fail to adequately perform to our clients expectations; fail to procure third party subcontractors, heavy equipment and materials; or fail to adequately secure funding for our projects, our profits, revenues and growth over the long term would decline. Such a decline could significantly affect the fair value assessment of our reporting units and cause our goodwill to become impaired. Of the key assumptions, the discount rates and the Capitalization Rate are market driven. These rates are derived from the use of market data and employment of the weighted average cost of capital. The key assumptions that are company driven include the revenue growth rates and the projected operating margins. They reflect the influence of other potential assumptions, since the assumptions we identified that affect the projected operating results may ultimately affect either the revenue growth or the profitability (operating margin) of the reporting unit. For example, any adjustment to our assumptions regarding contract volume and pricing would have a direct impact on revenue growth, and any adjustment to our assumptions regarding the reporting units cost structure or operating leverage would have a direct impact on the profitability of the reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts and changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment. We also consider indications obtained from the market approach. We applied market multiples derived from stock market prices of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business as our reporting units and that are actively traded on a free and open market, and applied market multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as our reporting units, and a control premium is applied to arrive at the fair values. Declines in the stock prices of other market participants in the construction and engineering industry could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the amount of a potential impairment. 82 If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill calculated in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, we would record an impairment charge for the difference. There are several instances that may cause us to further test our goodwill for impairment between the annual testing periods including: (i) continued deterioration of market and economic conditions that may adversely impact our ability to meet our projected results; (ii) a significant decline in our stock price; and (iii) the occurrence of events that may reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, such as significant or continued operating losses at the reporting unit level. If our goodwill were impaired, we would be required to record a non cash charge that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included under Item 8 of this report for more disclosure about our goodwill impairment reviews. Receivable Allowances We reduce our accounts receivable and costs and accrued earnings in excess of billings on contracts by establishing an allowance for amounts that, in the future, may become uncollectible or unrealizable, respectively. We determine our estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based on managements judgments regarding our operating performance related to the adequacy of the services performed or products delivered, the status of change orders and claims, our experience settling change orders and claims and the financial condition of our clients, which may be dependent on the type of client and current economic conditions to which the client may be subject. Deferred Income Taxes We use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results. Management believes that realization of deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance is more likely than not. Our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances, with the help of professional tax advisors. Therefore, we estimate and provide for amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities. Self insurance Reserves Self insurance reserves represent reserves established as a result of insurance programs under which we have self insured portions of our business risks. We carry substantial premium paid, traditional risk transfer insurance for our various business risks; however, we self insure and establish reserves for the retentions on workers compensation insurance, general liability, automobile liability, and professional errors and omissions liability. 83 Defined Benefit Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans using actuarial valuations that are based on assumptions, including discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets, and rates of change in participant compensation levels. We evaluate the funded status of each of our defined benefit pension plans using these assumptions, consider applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other relevant factors, and thereby determine the appropriate funding level for each period. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the pension benefit obligation is assessed at least annually. The discount rate represents the rate inherent in the price at which the plans obligations are intended to be settled at the measurement date. Holding all other assumptions constant, changes in the discount rate assumption that we used in our annual analysis would have the following estimated effect on the benefit obligations of our defined benefit plans as shown in the table below. Change in an Assumption (In millions) Domestic Defined Benefit Plans Foreign Defined Benefit Plans 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ (11.5 ) $ (25.9 ) 25 basis point decrease in discount rate $ 12.1 $ 27.6 Hypothetical changes in all other key assumptions of 25 basis points have an immaterial impact on the benefit obligations of our defined benefit plans. Hypothetical changes in key assumptions of 25 basis points also have an immaterial impact on net periodic pension costs of these plans. Business Combinations We account for business combinations under the purchase accounting method. The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make estimates and use valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. The transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as they are incurred. ADOPTED AND OTHER RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2, Adopted and Other Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this report. 84 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowings under our 2011 Credit Facility. Based on the outstanding term loan of $605.0 million under our 2011 Credit Facility, if market rates used to calculate interest expense were to average 1% higher in the next twelve months, our net of tax interest expense would increase by approximately $4.0 million. As market rates are at historically low levels, the index rate used to calculate our interest expense cannot drop by the full 1% as our current variable index is 0.17%. If our variable margin rate drops by 0.17%, it would lower our net of tax interest expense by approximately $1.0 million. This analysis is computed taking into account the current outstanding term loan of our 2011 Credit Facility, assumed interest rates and current debt payment schedule. The result of this analysis would change if the underlying assumptions were modified. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our transactions are in U.S. dollars; however, our foreign subsidiaries conduct businesses in various foreign currencies. Therefore, we are subject to currency exposures and volatility because of currency fluctuations. We attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching our revenues and expenses in the same currency for our contracts. From time to time, we purchase derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to manage specific foreign currency exposures. We had a foreign currency translation loss of $70.2 million, a foreign currency translation gain of $24.8 million, and a foreign currency translation loss of $11.2 million for the years ended January 3, 2014, December 28, 2012 and December 30, 2011, respectively. 85
