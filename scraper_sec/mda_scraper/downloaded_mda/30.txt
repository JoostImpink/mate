ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are identified by words such as may, believes, expects, plans and similar terminology. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) general economic and market conditions, including political and economic uncertainty in areas of the world where we do business; (ii) varying and seasonal levels of demand for our products and services; (iii) risks associated with acquisitions; (iv) credit risks from our financing of customer purchases; (v) risks arising from dependence on third party suppliers; and (vi) costs of raw materials and energy, as well as other risks as described in Item 1A of Part I of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable laws. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto found under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, Part II of this report. OVERVIEW We currently operate through four business segments: North American Distribution, European Distribution, Rest of World Distribution and Access Financial Solutions. Our North American Distribution, European Distribution and Rest of World Distribution segments design, manufacture and sell aerial work platforms, telehandlers and trailers, as well as an array of complementary accessories that increase the versatility and efficiency of these products for end users. In addition, these segments provide after sales service and support for our installed base of equipment, including parts sales and equipment rentals, and sell used and remanufactured or reconditioned equipment. Until February 2006, when we sold the product line, our results included the manufacture and sale of telescopic hydraulic excavators. Our Access Financial Solutions segment arranges equipment financing and leasing solutions for our customers primarily through third party financial institutions and provides credit support in connection with those financing and lease arrangements. We sell our products on a global basis to equipment rental companies, construction contractors, manufacturing companies, home improvement centers, the U.S. military, state and local municipalities and equipment distributors that resell our equipment. Approximately 60% of our new equipment sales during fiscal 2004, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 were to equipment rental companies. Demand for our equipment, parts and services is cyclical and seasonal. Factors that influence the demand for our equipment include the level of economic activity in our principal markets, North America, Europe, Australia and Latin America, particularly as it affects the level of commercial and other non residential construction activity, prevailing rental rates for the type of equipment we manufacture, the age and utilization rates of the equipment in our rental company customers fleets relative to the equipments useful life and the cost and availability of financing for our equipment. These factors affect demand for our new and remanufactured or reconditioned equipment as well as our services that support our customers installed base of equipment. Demand for our equipment is generally strongest during the spring and summer months, and we have historically recorded higher revenues and profits in our fiscal third and fourth quarters relative to our fiscal first and second quarters. On October 27, 2005, we entered into a 20 year strategic alliance with Caterpillar Inc. (Caterpillar) to design and produce a full line of Caterpillar branded telehandler products exclusively for Caterpillar dealers. This alliance established separate deadlines in different geographic markets for the transition of telehandler manufacturing and selling responsibility from Caterpillar to us. This transition is proceeding on schedule, and we began shipping to European Caterpillar dealers in July 2006 and will begin shipping telehandlers to North American Caterpillar dealers in November 2006. On February 3, 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets pertaining to our line of Gradall excavators to Alamo Group Inc. (AGI) for cash consideration of $33.0 million. The sale included the 430,000 square foot manufacturing facility in New Philadelphia, Ohio and related equipment, machinery, tooling, and intellectual property. The Gradall excavator product line included crawler and wheeled models. In addition to the purchase 19 Table of Contents agreement, we executed a six month transition supply agreement with AGI covering components for our telescopic material handler product lines that at closing were manufactured at the New Philadelphia facility. The sale of our line of Gradall excavators resulted in a one time pre tax gain of $14.6 million in our third quarter of fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 results significantly outpaced fiscal 2005. Driven by continued strong demand across most of our product lines and in all regions throughout the world in which we have operations, our revenues reached $2.3 billion, the highest in our 37 year history. These record revenues reflect a 32.0% increase over fiscal 2005 and a three year annualized compound growth rate of 45%. Fiscal 2006 revenues in the U.S. increased 28.0% and international revenues rose 44.2%, including a 54.7% increase in European sales compared to fiscal 2005. Our operating profit for fiscal 2006 of $263.0 million represents a 118.7% increase over fiscal 2005. Our operating profit included a gain of $14.6 million from the sale of our Gradall excavator product line and $22 million of expenses associated with our strategic initiatives, discussed below, in fiscal 2006 and OmniQuip integration expenses of $6.3 million in fiscal 2005. The operating profit margin also improved to 11.5% from the fiscal 2005 level of 6.9%. Net income more than doubled to $149.3 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, compared to $57.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. We delivered this strong financial performance while executing the largest manufacturing realignment and capacity expansion in our history. Our strong financial performance strengthened our balance sheet. We ended fiscal 2006 with a $328.1 million balance of cash and cash equivalents compared to a balance of $223.6 million at the end of fiscal 2005. Despite the surge in revenues in fiscal 2006, we reduced trade receivable days sales outstanding to 51 from 57 in fiscal 2005 while inventory turns held steady at 7.6. In the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows, we attempt to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We reported net income of $149.3 million, or $1.40 per share on a diluted basis, for fiscal 2006 compared to net income of $57.2 million, or $0.60 per share on a diluted basis, for fiscal 2005, and net income of $26.6 million, or $0.30 per share on a diluted basis, for fiscal 2004. Earnings before taxes for fiscal 2006 included a gain of $14.6 million from the sale of our Gradall excavator product line, costs of $1.9 million associated with the early retirement of debt and unfavorable currency adjustments of $2.8 million compared to favorable currency adjustments of $5.8 million and net costs of $6.5 million associated with the early retirement of debt for fiscal 2005 and unfavorable currency adjustments of $2.3 million for fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2006, our revenues were $2.3 billion, up 32.0% from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2005, which were up 45.3% from the $1.2 billion reported for fiscal 2004. 20 Table of Contents The following tables outline our revenues by segment, product, and geographic region (in millions) for the years ended July 31: Years Ended July 31, 2006 2005 2004 Segment: (a) North American Distribution $ 1,704.0 $ 1,329.6 $ 930.8 European Distribution 407.2 261.6 177.4 Rest of World Distribution 166.8 130.0 69.9 Access Financial Solutions (b) 11.4 13.8 15.9 $ 2,289.4 $ 1,735.0 $ 1,194.0 Products: Aerial work platforms $ 1,159.8 $ 888.0 $ 562.0 Telehandlers 776.0 511.8 358.9 Excavators 26.8 61.6 52.7 After sales service and support, including parts sales, and used and reconditioned equipment sales 305.7 252.4 196.6 Financial products (b) 11.1 11.9 15.2 Rentals 10.0 9.3 8.6 $ 2,289.4 $ 1,735.0 $ 1,194.0 Geographic: (a) United States $ 1,678.7 $ 1,311.5 $ 923.7 Europe 408.5 264.0 178.4 Other 202.2 159.5 91.9 $ 2,289.4 $ 1,735.0 $ 1,194.0 (a) Revenues by segment and geographic region are not the same since revenues for Access Financial Solutions are included in the United States and Europe as well as revenues from sales in Canada being included in Other. (b) Revenues for Access Financial Solutions and for financial products are not the same because Access Financial Solutions also receives revenues from rental purchase agreements that are recorded for accounting purposes as rental revenues from operating leases. Results for Fiscal 2006 and 2005 The 28.2% increase in North American Distribution segment revenues from $1.3 billion for fiscal 2005 to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2006 reflected strong growth in sales of telehandlers and aerial work platforms, as the primary drivers of equipment demand, commercial and non residential construction and solid economic activity, continued to be strong during fiscal 2006. Fleet age, rental rates and utilization of our type of equipment continue to drive demand in most product lines as rental companies maintain their strong pace of equipment refreshment and expansion. In addition, our service parts sales increased as a result of increased utilization of our customers fleet equipment, as did our rebuilt equipment sales to the military as a result of new contracts entered into during fiscal 2006. Partially offsetting the increase in North American Distribution segment revenues were decreases in sales of excavators and excavator service parts as a result of the sale of this product line early in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and a decrease in sales from our rental fleet. The 55.7% increase in European Distribution segment revenues from $261.6 million for fiscal 2005 to $407.2 million for fiscal 2006 reflected strong growth in sales of aerial work platforms and telehandlers as a result of improved market conditions and increased sales from our rental fleet primarily due to a $30.0 million sale during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 to one customer. 21 Table of Contents The 28.3% increase in Rest of World Distribution segment revenues from $130.0 million for fiscal 2005 to $166.8 million for fiscal 2006 reflected strong growth in sales of aerial work platforms, telehandlers and parts in all regions, partially offset by a decrease in sales of excavators as a result of the sale of this product line early in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The 17.1% decrease in Access Financial Solutions segment revenues from $13.8 million for fiscal 2005 to $11.4 million for fiscal 2006 was principally attributable to transitioning customers to our private label limited recourse financing arrangements originated through finance companies and to an early payoff of a financed receivable, partially offset by an increase in revenues from our private label limited recourse financing solutions through program agreements with third party funding providers. While we experienced decreased interest income attributable to our pledged finance receivables, we also experienced a corresponding decrease in our limited recourse debt. This resulted in $3.1 million less of interest income being passed on to monetization purchasers in the form of interest expense on limited recourse debt. In accordance with the required accounting treatment, the interest portion of the payments to monetization purchasers is reflected as interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our gross profit margin increased to 19.4% in fiscal 2006 from 16.6% in fiscal 2005 The gross profit margin of our North American Distribution segment was 18.4% for fiscal 2006 compared to 13.7% for fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due the favorable impact of the price increases and surcharges that were implemented throughout fiscal 2005 to offset the increase in commodities, especially steel, our cost reduction activities, a favorable sales mix, including an increase in our service parts sales, improved margins on used equipment sales, reflecting increased demand for used equipment, and a favorable one time adjustment for inbound freight costs related to a change in costing methodology. Partially offsetting these effects were the impact of rising energy prices, which continue to drive up the cost of freight and petroleum based components, and expenses related to the integration of the Caterpillar telehandler product line. The gross profit margin of our European Distribution segment was 17.5% for fiscal 2006 compared to 20.1% for fiscal 2005. The decrease in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the higher standard cost on machinery shipped from the U.S., a less favorable product and customer mix and the unfavorable impact of currency, partially offset by the favorable impact of the price increases and surcharges that were implemented throughout fiscal 2005 to offset the increase in commodities. The standard cost on machinery shipped from the U.S. during fiscal 2006 included the increased cost of commodities, which were not included in the fiscal 2005 standard cost. The gross profit margin of our Rest of World Distribution segment was 28.5% for fiscal 2006 compared to 30.9% for fiscal 2005. The decrease in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the higher standard cost on machinery shipped from the U.S. and a less favorable product mix, partially offset by the favorable impact of the price increases and surcharges that were implemented throughout fiscal 2005 to offset the increase in commodities. The standard cost on machinery shipped from the U.S. during fiscal 2006 included the increased cost of commodities, which were not included in the fiscal 2005 standard cost. The gross profit margin of our Access Financial Solutions segment was 98.5% for fiscal 2006 compared to 93.8% for fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in limited recourse financing as a percentage of total segment revenues. The gross margins are typically higher in this segment since the costs associated with revenues are principally selling and administrative expenses and interest expense. 22 Table of Contents Our selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $27.6 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, but as a percentage of revenues decreased to 8.5% for fiscal 2006 compared to 9.6% for fiscal 2005. The following table summarizes the changes by category in selling, administrative and product development expenses for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 (in millions): Strategic initiatives $ 11.7 Bonus expense 5.5 Consulting and legal costs 4.6 Salaries and related benefits 4.5 Stock option expense 3.6 Profit sharing and 401(k) plan 2.2 Accelerated vesting of restricted shares (1.7 ) Other (2.8 ) $ 27.6 Our North American Distribution segments selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $6.1 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to our strategic initiatives discussed below, which include the integration of the Caterpillar telehandler product line, increased consulting and legal costs associated with the outsourcing of research and development projects and ordinary business activities, our increased profitability, additional employees and normal merit compensation increases, resulting in higher bonus expense and higher payroll and related benefit costs including our discretionary profit sharing contribution and 401(k) plan expense, partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the Gradall excavator product line and a decrease in costs related to advertising and trade shows. Our European Distribution segments selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $1.2 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to increased costs related to advertising and trade shows and expenses related to the integration of the Caterpillar product line, partially offset by a decrease in our bad debt provision. Our Rest of World Distribution segments selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $0.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to our increased profitability, additional employees and normal merit compensation increases, resulting in higher bonus expense and higher payroll and related benefit costs and increased costs related to advertising and trade shows. Our Access Financial Solutions segments selling and administrative expenses increased $1.1 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to an increase in our bad debt provision. Our general corporate selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $18.8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to our increased profitability, additional employees and normal merit compensation increases, resulting in higher bonus expense and higher payroll and related benefit costs including our discretionary profit sharing contribution and 401(k) plan expense, the expensing of stock options, which began during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, our strategic initiatives discussed below and increased consulting and legal costs associated with ordinary business activities. Partially offsetting these effects was the absence of costs associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted share awards during fiscal 2005 triggered by our share price appreciation. The decrease in interest expense (net of interest income) of $10.9 million for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $6.0 million resulting from our increased cash balance and rising interest rates, and a decrease in interest expense of $4.9 million. The decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of a decrease in our limited recourse debt associated with our limited recourse and non recourse monetizations and the early retirement of $76.3 million of principal amount of our outstanding 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and of our outstanding outstanding 8 1/4% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2008 (the 2008 Notes) during fiscal 2005 and $20.4 million of principal amount of our outstanding 2008 Notes during fiscal 2006. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest expense was an adjustment to the interest associated with the hedging of our fixed rate debt. Interest expense associated with our finance receivables monetizations was $3.1 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $6.2 million in fiscal 2005. 23 Table of Contents Our miscellaneous income (expense) category included currency losses of $2.8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to currency gains of $5.8 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, our miscellaneous income (expense) category for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 included $1.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, of costs associated with the early retirement of debt. The change in currency for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the currency effect on our hedging positions as the U.S. dollar weakened significantly against the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar during fiscal 2006. We enter into certain foreign currency contracts; principally forward contracts, to manage some of our foreign exchange risk. Some natural hedges are also used to mitigate transaction and forecasted exposures. Through our foreign currency hedging activities, we seek primarily to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of our products will be affected by changes in exchange rates. We do not designate our forward exchange contracts as hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and as a result we recognize the mark to market gain or loss on these contracts in earnings. For additional information related to our derivative instruments, see Item 7A of Part II of this report and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 was 38% as compared to 39% in fiscal 2005. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to providing for tax contingencies related to potential adverse tax adjustments, partially offset by a favorable source of earnings among taxing jurisdictions. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 will be 39%. Results for Fiscal 2005 and 2004 The 42.8% increase in North American Distribution segment revenues from $930.8 million for fiscal 2004 to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2005 reflected strong growth in all product lines, primarily resulting from general economic growth in North America, reflecting positive trends in construction spending, capacity utilization and consumer confidence and from improved market conditions and increased demand for used equipment. The 47.5% increase in European Distribution segment revenues from $177.4 million for fiscal 2004 to $261.6 million for fiscal 2005 reflected strong growth in sales of aerial work platforms, service parts and telehandlers due to the growth in the European economy. Partially offsetting the increase in sales was a decrease in sales of used equipment. The 86.0% increase in Rest of World Distribution segment revenues from $69.9 million for fiscal 2004 to $130.0 million for fiscal 2005 reflected growth in all product lines, primarily resulting from higher demand in Australia due to increased spending on public and private infrastructure and from increased demand in the Pacific Rim and Latin America markets as a result of improved economic conditions. The 13.5% decrease in Access Financial Solutions segment revenues from $15.9 million for fiscal 2004 to $13.8 million for fiscal 2005 was principally attributable to a decrease in our portfolio as we continued to transition customers to our limited recourse financing arrangements originated through private label finance companies. While we experienced decreased interest income attributable to our pledged finance receivables, we also experienced a corresponding decrease in our limited recourse debt. This resulted in $3.9 million less of interest income being passed on to monetization purchasers in the form of interest expense on limited recourse debt. Our gross profit margin decreased to 16.6% in fiscal 2005 from 18.9% in fiscal 2004 The gross profit margin of our North American Distribution segment was 13.7% for fiscal 2005 compared to 17.1% for fiscal 2004. The decrease in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to an increase in market prices of raw materials, such as steel and energy, continued manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from capacity constraints in our supplier base, a less favorable product mix and lower margins on service parts sales. The decrease in our gross profit margin was partially offset by the higher sales volume during fiscal 2005, price increases and surcharges, cost reductions, productivity improvements, lower OmniQuip integration expenses and improved margins on used equipment sales reflecting increased demand for used equipment. 24 Table of Contents The gross profit margin of our European Distribution segment was 20.1% for fiscal 2005 compared to 16.5% for fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a favorable product mix, improved margins on used equipment sales and the favorable impact of currency, partially offset by an increase in market prices of raw materials, such as steel and energy. The gross profit margin of our Rest of World Distribution segment was 30.9% for fiscal 2005 compared to 30.8% for fiscal 2004. The gross profit margin of our Access Financial Solutions segment was 93.8% for fiscal 2005 compared to 95.9% for fiscal 2004. The decrease in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in financial product revenues as we continue to transition customers to our limited recourse arrangements originated through private label finance companies. Because the costs associated with these revenues are principally selling and administrative expenses and interest expense, gross margins are typically higher in this segment. Our selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $17.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004, but as a percentage of revenues decreased to 9.6% for fiscal 2005 compared to 12.5% for fiscal 2004. The following table summarizes the changes by category in selling, administrative and product development expenses for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 (in millions): Salaries and related benefits $ 5.4 Bonus expense 3.9 Advertising and trade shows 3.2 Incremental expenses from Delta operations 2.9 Consulting and legal costs 2.2 Depreciation and amortization expense 1.6 Product development expenses 1.4 ServicePlus operations 1.4 Utilities 1.1 Pension and other postretirement benefit costs (1.1 ) OmniQuip integration expenses (4.2 ) Bad debt provisions (4.6 ) Other 4.3 $ 17.5 Our North American Distribution segments selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $0.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to an increase in costs related to advertising and trade shows, expenses associated with our ServicePlus operations, which we launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an increase in product development expenses related to our aerial work platforms and telehandler products, and an increase in our utilities expense. Partially offsetting these effects were decreases in OmniQuip integration expenses and pension and other postretirement benefit costs. Our European Distribution segments selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $5.6 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to expenses associated with our Delta operations, higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees and normal merit compensation increases, increased depreciation and amortization expense, increased consulting and legal costs associated with ordinary business activities, and an increase in bonus expense primarily due to our increased profitability. Partially offsetting these effects was a decrease in our bad debt provision primarily as a result of specific reserves incurred during the prior year. Our Rest of World Distribution segments selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $1.4 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees and normal merit compensation increases and an increase in outside sales commissions as a result of the sales volume increase. Our Access Financial Solutions segments selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to a decrease in bad debt provisions as a result of the lower 25 Table of Contents reserve needed because of the decrease in outstanding pledged finance receivables. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees and normal merit compensation increases. Our general corporate selling, administrative and product development expenses increased $10.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to higher payroll and related benefit expense as a result of additional employees and normal merit compensation increases, increased bonus expense primarily due to our increased profitability offset in part by a reclassification between segments, increased consulting and legal costs associated with ordinary business activities, an increase in our bad debt provision and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The decrease in interest expense (net of interest income) of $6.8 million for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to decreased interest expense of $5.9 million associated with our limited recourse and non recourse monetizations as a result of a decrease in our limited recourse debt and the early retirement of $61.3 million in principal amount of our outstanding 2012 Notes and $15.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 2008 Notes during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005, and a $0.9 million increase in interest income. Interest expense associated with our finance receivables monetizations was $6.2 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $10.1 million in fiscal 2004. Our miscellaneous income (expense) category included currency gains of $5.8 million in fiscal 2005 compared to currency losses of $2.3 million in fiscal 2004. In addition, our miscellaneous income (expense) category for fiscal 2005 included $6.0 million of costs associated with the early retirement of debt. The change in currency for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to favorable realized currency gains during the year resulting from the weaker U.S. dollar against the Euro, British pound and the Australian dollar, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of realized and unrealized forward exchange contracts. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 was 39% as compared to 36% in fiscal 2004. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was higher than the statutory rate principally due to non deductible compensation related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards triggered by our share price appreciation and foreign valuation allowances. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow From Operating Activities Cash generated from operating activities was $118.8 million for fiscal 2006 compared to $142.4 million in fiscal 2005 and $14.7 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in cash from operations for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from higher inventory levels to support the increased business activity; the change in accounts payable resulting from a decrease in our days payables outstanding; a larger increase in our accounts receivable balance at the end of fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of our $118.1 million increase in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006; an increase in our notes receivable and other investments during fiscal 2006 compared to a reduction during fiscal 2005; an increase in the payments of sales rebates as a result of our higher sales volume and a decrease in the value of our forward exchange contracts. Partially offsetting the decreases were increases in our net income and accrued taxes due to our increased profitability. The increase in cash generated from operations in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from a smaller increase in trade receivables as compared to fiscal 2004 which was attributable to stronger collections; an increase in our net income; and an increase in accounts payable due to higher production levels as a result of the increase in demand for our products, partially offset by higher inventory levels to support the increased business activity and inefficiencies associated with component shortages. Stronger collections were principally from the results of an initiative under our Six Sigma program focused on improving collection processes and procedures. 26 Table of Contents Cash Flow Used For Investing Activities We used cash of $38.8 million for investment purposes during fiscal 2006 compared to $10.3 million during fiscal 2005 and $114.9 million during fiscal 2004. Our increase in the use of cash for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was principally due to the acquisition of Caterpillar telehandler assets (certain equipment, inventory and substantially all of the tooling and intellectual property) and an increase in capital expenditures as a result of our strategic initiatives discussed below. Partially offsetting the increase in cash usage were proceeds received from the sale of our excavator product line assets during fiscal 2006. The reduction in cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was principally due to the absence of an acquisition in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2004, we acquired OmniQuip for $107.1 million. Cash Flow From Financing Activities We had cash flows from financing activities of $25.9 million for fiscal 2006 compared to $61.7 million for fiscal 2005 and $4.8 million for fiscal 2004. The decrease in cash from financing activities for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was largely attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in fiscal 2005 that was not repeated in fiscal 2006, partially offset by a lower amount of debt repurchases and the increase in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. The increase in cash from financing activities for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was largely attributable to our net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and from the exercise of stock options during fiscal 2005. Partially offsetting the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the repurchase of $15.0 million in principal amount of our outstanding 2008 Notes, the repurchase of $61.3 million in principal amount of our outstanding 2012 Notes and the absence of monetizations of our finance receivables during fiscal 2005 compared to $14.0 million of monetizations during fiscal 2004. Due to the seasonality of our sales, during certain periods we may generate negative cash flows from operations despite reporting profits. Generally, this may occur in periods in which we are building inventory levels in anticipation of sales during peak periods as well as other uses of working capital related to payment terms associated with trade receivables or other sale arrangements. We expect that our principal sources of liquidity for fiscal 2007 will be existing cash balances, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Availability of funds under our credit facilities and monetizations of finance receivables depend on a variety of factors described below. As of July 31, 2006, we had cash balances totaling $328.1 million and unused credit commitments totaling $202.5 million. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations (in millions) at July 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period Less than After Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Short and long term debt (a) $ 286.1 $ 25.7 $ 118.0 $ 24.5 $ 117.9 Limited recourse debt (b) 23.7 16.0 7.7 Operating leases (c) 37.7 7.4 13.7 6.7 9.9 Purchase obligations (d) 147.7 147.7 Total contractual obligations (e) $ 495.2 $ 196.8 $ 139.4 $ 31.2 $ 127.8 (a) Includes our 2008 Notes, 2012 Notes, a $10.0 million five year loan and a $5.0 million promissory note as more fully described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report and associated estimated interest expense payments. (b) Our limited recourse debt is the result of the sale of finance receivables through limited recourse monetization transactions. (c) In accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, operating lease obligations are not reflected in the balance sheet. 27 Table of Contents (d) We enter into contractual arrangements that result in our obligation to make future payments, including purchase obligations. We enter into these arrangements in the ordinary course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of inventories, machinery and equipment, or services. Purchase obligations primarily consist of inventory purchase commitments, including raw materials, components and sourced products. (e) We anticipate that our funding obligation for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2007 will approximate $1.9 million. That amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current benefits. We have not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions. The following table provides a summary of our other commercial commitments (in millions) at July 31, 2006: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Amounts Less than Over Committed 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Standby letters of credit $ 12.5 $ 10.8 $ 1.7 $ $ Guarantees (a) 87.3 13.6 19.7 52.1 1.9 Total commercial commitments $ 99.8 $ 24.4 $ 21.4 $ 52.1 $ 1.9 (a) We discuss our guarantee agreements in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. As discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report, we are a party to multiple agreements whereby we guarantee $87.3 million in indebtedness of others. In connection with our customer financing activities, guarantees comprise one of the financing or credit support programs that we offer to certain of our customers. These guarantees arise from those customer financing activities. If the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Also as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be affected to the extent that our ultimate exposure with respect to product liability varies from current estimates. Also as discussed in Note 14 and in Item 3 of Part I of this report, pending legal proceedings and other contingencies have the potential to adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity. STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES On October 27, 2005, we entered into a 20 year strategic Alliance with Caterpillar related to the design, manufacture and sale by us of Caterpillar branded telehandlers. The Alliance establishes separate dates in different geographic markets for the transition of telehandler manufacturing and selling responsibility from Caterpillar to us ranging from July 1 to November 1, 2006. As part of the Alliance, we acquired certain equipment, inventory and substantially all of the tooling and intellectual property used by Caterpillar exclusively in connection with the design and manufacture of Caterpillars current European telehandler products. The purchase price for these Caterpillar telehandler assets was $46.4 million paid at closing, plus $5.0 million that was paid on September 15, 2006. Our strategic initiatives for fiscal 2006 included the development of the North American Caterpillar telehandler product line and capacity improvements in both Belgium and Pennsylvania to accommodate the additional volume, for the expansion of our ServicePlus operations, formation of our Commercial Solutions Group, reopening of the Bedford, Pennsylvania and Orrville, Ohio facilities, All Terrain Lifter, Army System (ATLAS) II military telehandler development and other proprietary projects. As a result of these strategic initiatives, approximately $22 million was expensed during fiscal 2006, a reduction of approximately $4 million from our previous estimate largely as a result of a reduction in expenses related to the integration of the Caterpillar telehandler product line. 28 Table of Contents For fiscal 2006, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $25.5 million in property, plant and equipment, which included capital investments in the strategic initiatives described above. This is a reduction of approximately $15.5 million from our previous estimate largely as a result of rental fleet sales exceeding rental fleet purchases by approximately $7.1 million for fiscal 2006 and the timing of the expenditures related to the Caterpillar telehandler product line. Included in the total, is the $10.8 million in capital expenditures associated with the Caterpillar Alliance. For fiscal 2007, we anticipate incurring capital expenditures of $80 million in property, plant and equipment, which includes net rental fleet purchases of approximately $30 million. On February 3, 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets pertaining to our line of Gradall excavators to AGI for cash consideration of $33.0 million. The sale included the 430,000 square foot manufacturing facility in New Philadelphia, Ohio and related equipment, machinery, tooling, and intellectual property. The Gradall excavator product line included crawler and wheeled models. In addition to the purchase agreement, we executed a transition supply agreement with AGI covering components for our telescopic material handler product lines that at closing were manufactured at the New Philadelphia facility. On April 30, 2004, we completed the purchase of Delta for $9.9 million, which included transaction expenses of $0.9 million. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. Headquartered in Tonneins, France, Delta has two facilities that manufacture the Toucan brand of vertical mast lifts, and a line of aerial work platforms distributed throughout Europe for use principally in industrial and maintenance operations. In addition, we purchased certain intellectual property and related assets of Manitowocs discontinued product lines, which permitted us to re launch selected Liftlux models. We funded the purchase price with cash generated from operations. On August 1, 2003, we completed the OmniQuip acquisition, which includes all operations relating to the SkyTrak and Lull brand telehandler products. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. The purchase price was $100.0 million, with $90.0 million paid in cash at closing and $10.0 million paid in the form of an unsecured subordinated promissory note due on the second anniversary of the closing date. On February 4, 2004, we paid off the $10.0 million unsecured subordinated promissory note and paid post closing purchase price adjustments in favor of Textron totaling $1.5 million. In addition, we incurred $5.6 million in transaction expenses. We funded the cash portion of the purchase price and the transaction expenses with remaining unallocated proceeds from the sale of our 2008 Notes. LONG TERM DEBT AND EQUITY On March 22, 2006, we entered into a $10.0 million, 2 1/2% fixed rate, five year loan that matures on April 1, 2011. This loan was related to job creation and was extended by Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania in partnership with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a result of our expansion efforts including the reopening of our Sunnyside facility in Bedford, Pennsylvania. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, we used approximately $22.0 million of cash generated from operations for the acceptance of unsolicited offers by note holders to sell $20.4 million in principal amount of our outstanding 2008 Notes at prices ranging from 104.25% to 105.625% of such principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We incurred charges of approximately $0.8 million (after taxes) relating to the extinguishment of debt and the write off of deferred financing costs resulting from the open market purchases of our 2008 Notes. These purchases of our 2008 Notes will lower our future interest expense by $1.7 million annually and they reduced our fiscal 2006 interest expense by $0.5 million. On March 16, 2005, we completed the sale of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $10.99 per share. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us, net proceeds from this offering totaled approximately $119.4 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we used approximately $68.1 million of the net proceeds from the common stock offering to redeem $61.3 million in principal amount of our outstanding 2012 Notes under an equity clawback provision that permits a redemption of up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2012 Notes at 29 Table of Contents a price equal to 108.375% of such principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at any time prior to June 15, 2005. We incurred a charge of approximately $3.2 million (after taxes) relating to the extinguishment of debt, net of the deferred gain on the related interest rate swap, and the write off of deferred financing costs resulting from the redemption of our 2012 Notes. The redemption of our 2012 Notes lowered our interest expense by $5.1 million annually, and it reduced our fiscal 2005 interest expense by $1.5 million. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005, we used approximately $16.4 million of the net proceeds from the common stock offering for the acceptance of unsolicited offers by note holders to sell $15.0 million in principal amount of our outstanding 2008 Notes at prices ranging from 105.25% to 106% of such principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We incurred a charge of approximately $0.7 million (after taxes) relating to the extinguishment of debt and the write off of deferred financing costs resulting from the open market purchase of our 2008 Notes. The purchases of our 2008 Notes lowered our interest expense by $1.2 million annually, and it reduced our fiscal 2005 interest expense by $0.4 million. CREDIT FACILITIES We have a five year $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility that expires November 30, 2010. The facility includes an accordion feature under which JLG, subject to obtaining increased commitments from existing or new lenders, may increase the maximum availability of the facility up to $300 million. In addition, we have a pari passu, $15.0 million cash management facility that expires November 30, 2007. Both facilities are secured by a lien on substantially all of our domestic assets excluding property, plant and equipment. Availability of credit requires compliance with various covenants, including a requirement that in the event the facility borrowing availability is less than 15%, at any time, or in the event that during the 90 day period following payment of certain bond obligations, the facility borrowing availability is less than 40%, we will maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the senior secured revolving credit facility) of not less than 1.10 to 1.0. Availability of credit also will be limited by a borrowing base determined on a monthly basis by reference to 85% of eligible domestic accounts receivable and percentages ranging between 25% and 70% of various categories of domestic inventory. Accordingly, credit available to us under these facilities will vary with seasonal and other changes in the borrowing base, and we may not have full availability of the stated maximum amount of credit at all times. However, based on our current business plan, we expect to have sufficient credit available that, combined with existing cash balances and cash to be generated from operations, will meet our expected seasonal requirements for working capital, planned capital and integration expenditures for the next twelve months. MONETIZATION OF FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND PROGRAM AGREEMENTS Historically, our Access Financial Solutions segment originated and monetized customer finance receivables principally through limited recourse syndications. Since late 2003, the focus of this segment has shifted to providing private label financing solutions through program agreements with third party funding providers, subject to limited recourse to us. Transactions funded by the finance companies are not held by us as financial assets, and therefore the subsequent payment from the finance companies is not recorded on our financial statements. We may still fund some transactions not funded by the finance companies to the extent of our liquidity sources. These transactions may subsequently be monetized. During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 no finance receivables were monetized and in fiscal 2004, we monetized $13.4 million of finance receivables through syndications. During the same periods, $86.3 million, $38.0 million and $21.2 million, respectively, of sales to our customers were funded through program agreements with third party finance companies. Although monetizations generate cash, under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, the monetized portion of our finance receivables portfolio remains recorded on our balance sheet as limited recourse debt with the associated pledged finance receivable that was sold. We expect that our limited recourse debt balance will continue to decline. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates 30 Table of Contents and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment, estimation, or complexity than other accounting policies. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Reserves for Finance Receivables: We evaluate the collectibility of receivables based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. Additional reserves are established based upon our perception of the quality of the current receivables, the current financial position of our customers and past experience of collectibility. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Goodwill: We perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, or a material negative change in a relationship with a significant customer. Guarantees of the Indebtedness of Others: We enter into agreements with finance companies whereby our equipment is sold to a finance company, which, in turn, sells or leases it to a customer. In some instances, we retain a liability in the event the customer defaults on the financing. Reserves are established related to these guarantees based upon our understanding of the current financial position of these customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time. If we become aware of deterioration in the financial condition of our customers or of any impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Although we may be liable for the entire amount of a customers financial obligation under guarantees, our losses would be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral including financed equipment. In addition, we have monetized a substantial portion of the receivables originated by AFS through a series of syndications, limited recourse financings and other monetization transactions. In connection with some of these monetization transactions, we have a loss exposure associated with our pledged finance receivables related to possible defaults by the obligors under the terms of the contracts, which comprise these finance receivables. Contingencies have been established related to these monetization transactions based upon the current financial position of these customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time. If the financial condition of these obligors were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. We discuss our guarantee agreements in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. Income Taxes: We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year on a quarterly basis. The rate determined is used in providing for income taxes on a year to date basis. The tax effect of specific discrete items is reflected in the period in which they occur. If the estimates and related assumptions used to calculate the effective tax rate change, we may be required to adjust our effective rate, which could change income tax expense. We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required. The carrying value of the net deferred tax assets assumes, based on estimates and assumptions, that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the benefits of such assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in 31 Table of Contents our Consolidated Statements of Income. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carry back opportunities and tax planning strategies in making the assessment. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings and or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Certain items in inventory may be considered impaired, obsolete or excess and as such, we may establish an allowance to reduce the carrying value of these items to their net realizable value. We also value used equipment taken in trade from our customers. Based on certain estimates, assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time, we determine the amounts of these inventory allowances. If these estimates and related assumptions or the market for our equipment change, we may be required to record additional reserves. Long Lived Assets: We review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by us related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than our estimates, long lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against earnings. Pension and Postretirement Benefits: Pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculation of these amounts. These assumptions, used by actuaries, include discount rates, expected returns on plan assets for funded plans, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, participant demographics and other factors. We consider current market conditions, including interest rates, in making these assumptions. We develop the discount rates by considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with long term maturities corresponding to the related benefit obligation. We develop the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors, which include the plans targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized to future periods and therefore affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Product Liability: Our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the use of equipment that we rent or sell. We maintain insurance through a combination of self insurance retentions, primary insurance and excess insurance coverage. We monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish liability reserves for the self insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims. Our liability estimates with respect to claims are based on internal evaluations of the merits of individual claims and the reserves assigned by our independent insurance claims adjustment firm. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting accrued liability are reviewed frequently, and adjustments resulting from our reviews are reflected in current earnings. If these estimates and related assumptions change, we may be required to record additional reserves. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when all the following criteria are satisfied with regard to a specific transaction: persuasive evidence that a sales arrangement exists; the price is fixed or determinable; 32 Table of Contents collectibility of cash is reasonably assured; and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. For the majority of our sales, we recognize revenue when title is transferred to the customer as soon as the product is shipped. For a portion of our sales, primarily in Europe, we recognize revenue when title is transferred to the customer upon receipt at the customers location. In addition, certain sales, including our ATLAS brand of military telehandler products, may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession. In such cases, revenue is recognized only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the equipment, the equipment has been completed and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery, and the customer has requested that we hold the equipment for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer. In such cases, the equipment is invoiced under our customary billing terms, title to the equipment and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon invoicing, the equipment is segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer, and we have no further obligations under the order other than customary post sales support activities. During fiscal 2006, less than 1.0% of our sales were invoiced and the revenue recognized prior to customers taking physical possession. In order for us to recognize revenue on the Millennia Military Vehicle (MMV) brand of military telehandler products, they must pass inspection by a government Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) at the point of production to ensure special paint requirements are met and by a government representative at the point of destination to verify delivery without damage during transportation. The terms for sales transactions with some of our distributors and customers may include specific volume based incentives, which are calculated and paid or credited on account as a percentage of actual purchases. We account for these incentives as sales discounts at the time of revenue recognition as a direct reduction of sales. We review our accrual for sales incentives on a quarterly basis and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings. We account for certain equipment lease contracts as sales type leases. The present value of all payments, net of executory costs (such as legal fees), is recorded as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales. The associated interest is recorded over the term of the lease using the interest method. In addition, we lease equipment held for rental and recognize rental revenues in the period they are earned over the lease term. We enter into rental purchase guarantee agreements (RPGs) with some of our customers. These agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase option at the end of the agreement. At the inception of the agreement, we record the full amount due under the agreement as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales. We ship equipment on a limited basis to certain customers on consignment, but we recognize the revenues only upon final sale of the equipment by the consignee. At July 31, 2006, we had $6.2 million of inventory on consignment. Warranty: We establish reserves related to the warranties we provide on our products. Specific reserves are maintained for programs related to equipment safety and reliability issues. We establish estimates based on the size of the population, the type of program, costs to be incurred by us and estimated participation. We maintain additional reserves based on the historical percentage relationships of such costs to equipment sales and applied to current equipment sales. If these estimates and related assumptions change, we may be required to record additional reserves. OUTLOOK Demand for access equipment remains strong, driven by expansion of our customers rental fleets and a robust non residential construction market. Our rental company customers continue to enjoy sustained high utilization rates and improved rental rates, feeding the demand for our products. Although housing starts have slowed, they remain strong based on historical comparisons. In fiscal 2007, our focus will be on improving the quality of earnings through aggressive cost reduction activities, especially across our entire telehandler product portfolio, and margin improvement through pricing action and control of associated discounts. We have successfully grown our telehandler market share positioning us now to focus on realizing the volume purchasing and other cost reduction benefits associated with our market leadership. Another focus will be our small scissor line where price is the deciding factor. We will continue to deploy our Six 33 Table of Contents Sigma strategy along with other lean principles and activities to improve our operational efficiency and the quality of our products and services. Absent any major geopolitical events or economic shocks, we anticipate continued strong demand for access equipment in fiscal 2007. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Information regarding off balance sheet arrangements is included in our Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments tables, Item 7 of Part II of this report and in Note 5 and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition. We manage exposure to these risks principally through our regular operating and financing activities. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our outstanding debt. Our outstanding interest rate swap instruments at July 31, 2006 consisted of a $70.0 million notional fixed to variable rate swap with a fixed rate receipt of 8 3/8% and a $62.5 million notional fixed to variable rate swap with a fixed rate receipt of 8 1/4%. The bases of the variable rates paid related to our $70.0 million and $62.5 million interest rate swap instruments are the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 4.51% and 5.15%, respectively. These swap agreements are designated as hedges of the fixed rate borrowings which are outstanding and are structured as perfect hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. During fiscal 2003, we terminated our $87.5 million notional fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with a fixed rate receipt of 8 3/8% that we entered into during June 2002, which resulted in a deferred gain of $6.2 million. The remaining deferred gain of $2.6 million will offset interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. Total interest bearing liabilities at July 31, 2006 consisted of $123.6 million in variable rate borrowing and $116.0 million in fixed rate borrowing. At the current level of variable rate borrowing, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would decrease pre tax current year earnings by approximately $1.2 million on an annual basis. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of our fixed rate debt. We manufacture our products in the United States, Belgium and France, and sell these products in North America and Europe as well as other international markets. As a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets, our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, as compared to foreign currencies in which certain of our transactions in foreign markets are denominated. At July 31, 2006, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have the effect of reducing gross profits for the year ended July 31, 2006 by approximately $47 million. This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not take into account potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices. 34 Table of Contents We enter into certain currency forward contracts to mitigate our foreign exchange risk that qualify as derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133. However, we have not designated these instruments as hedge transactions under SFAS No. 133 and, accordingly, the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings. Some natural hedges are also used to mitigate transaction and forecasted exposures. At July 31, 2006, we were managing $315.6 million of foreign currency contracts. Through our foreign currency hedging activities, we seek primarily to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of our products will be affected by changes in exchange rates. Additional information regarding our management of exposure to market risks is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8 of Part II of this report. 35 Table of Contents
