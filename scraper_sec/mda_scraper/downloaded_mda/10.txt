ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In Thousands of Dollars except for per share information. Introduction and Overview This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the operating performance and financial condition of Keithley Instruments, Inc. A discussion of our business, including our strategy for growth, products and competition, is included in Part I of this Form 10 K. Business Overview Our business is to design, develop, manufacture and market complex electronic instruments and systems geared to the specialized needs of engineers at electronics manufacturers and academic institutions for research, product development, high performance production testing and process monitoring. Our primary products are integrated systems used to source, measure, connect, control or communicate electrical direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) signals. Our product offerings include integrated systems solutions, along with instruments and data acquisition modules that can be used as system components or stand alone solutions. Our customers are engineers, technicians and scientists in manufacturing, product development and research functions. During fiscal 2010, approximately 35 percent of our orders were received from the semiconductor industry; approximately five percent came from the wireless communications customer group; approximately 25 percent came from the precision electronics customer group, which includes customers in automotive, computers and peripherals, medical equipment, aerospace and defense, and manufacturers of components; and approximately 25 percent came from research and education customers. The remainder of orders came from customers in a variety of other industries. Although our products vary in capability, sophistication, use, size and price, they generally test, measure and analyze electrical, optical or physical properties. As such, we consider our business to be in a single industry segment. The most important factors influencing our ability to grow revenue are (i) our customers spending patterns as they invest in new capacity or upgrade manufacturing lines for new product offerings, (ii) our ability to offer interrelated products with differentiated value that solve our customers most compelling test challenges, and (iii) our success in penetrating key accounts with our globally deployed sales and service team. We continue to believe that our strategy of pursuing a focused set of applications will allow us to grow faster than the overall test and measurement industry. Many of the industries we serve, including the semiconductor, wireless communications and precision electronic components industries, have historically been very cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns followed by periods of secular growth. Our customers across all industries and geographies demonstrated reduced order patterns, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continuing through mid fiscal year 2009. In response to these conditions, we took various cost reduction actions beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continuing through the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to reduce our future operating expenses. These actions included headcount reductions, a hiring freeze with the exception of a few critical replacements, reductions in our capital expenditures, and travel and other discretionary spending, a pay reduction for the majority of U.S. exempt employees and unpaid days off for U.S. non exempt employees, the suspension of the annual bonus program for management and lower sales commissions payments to the sales force, the suspension of the Companys 401(k) match and the exit of our S600 series product line. In addition, we sold substantially all of the assets related to our RF product line. Global semiconductor device sales have now exceeded levels achieved just prior to the financial crisis that began in the fall of calendar 2008, and we have experienced sequential increases in orders from our customers since the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Because of that improvement coupled with the previous cost reduction measures that are still in place, effective January 1, 2010, we restored compensation levels and work hours for U.S. exempt and non exempt employees, respectively, reinstated the Companys 401(k) match, and recorded variable costs for both annual and long term incentive plans. The Company recorded approximately $7,000 of expense during fiscal year 2010 as a result of the aforementioned costs. Our focus during the past several years has continued to center on building long term relationships and strong collaborative partnerships with our global customers to serve their measurement needs. Toward that end, we rely primarily upon employing our own sales personnel to sell our products, and using sales representatives, to whom we pay a commission, in areas where we believe it is not cost beneficial to employ our own people. This sales channel strategy allows us to build a sales network of focused, highly trained sales engineers who specialize in measurement expertise and problem solving for customers and enhances our ability to sell our products to customers with worldwide operations. We believe our ability to serve our customers has been strongly enhanced by deploying our own employees throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. As a substantial portion of our selling costs are fixed, we expect that selling through our own sales force will be favorable to earnings during times of strong sales, but will be unfavorable during times of depressed sales. 14 Table of Contents We continue to believe that both the semiconductor and wireless areas drive change within the electronics industry. These technology changes create many opportunities for us and we continued the introduction of new products and enhancements during fiscal 2010. Our research and education customers work involves advanced materials research in areas including nanotechnology, organic materials and thin film research. These materials are ultimately used in the next generation of semiconductors and cutting edge electronic devices. Additionally, our semiconductor customers include large integrated device manufacturers and foundries, fabless manufacturers as well as solar cell developers. We believe these customers will continue to generate demand because they continually are improving existing devices or developing new devices that in turn, create new measurement requirements. On December 8, 2010, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Aegean Acquisition Corp. was merged into the Company and each outstanding Common Share and Class B Common Share of the Company was converted into the right to receive $21.60 per share in cash. Also pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all outstanding stock options, restricted award units and performance award units were, at the time of closing, fully vested and cancelled in exchange for the merger consideration of $21.60 for each underlying Common Share, less any exercise price per share. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management has identified the Companys critical accounting policies. These policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements, either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate, or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring, at a specific point in time, events which will be settled in the future. Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the reported financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue recognition: Keithley Instruments, Inc. recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have been met when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Upon shipment, a provision is made for estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties and sales returns. Revenue earned from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual service periods and is not material to the Companys consolidated results. Shipping and handling costs are recorded as Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined based on a currently adjusted standard, which approximates actual cost on a first in, first out basis. We periodically review our recorded inventory and estimate a reserve for obsolete or slow moving items. If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional reserves may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, our cost of sales will be lower than expected in that period. Income taxes: Keithley is subject to taxation from federal, state and international jurisdictions. The annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of judgment by management. Judgment also is applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. In evaluating our ability to recover our net deferred tax assets, which totaled $2,601 at September 30, 2010, we considered all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of pretax operating income in each tax jurisdiction, the reversal of book versus tax differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. 15 Table of Contents We have established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, or NOLs, in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions which may not be realized due to the uncertainty of future profit levels in the respective jurisdictions. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance, until such NOLs are utilized or until such NOLs expire. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance. The realization of certain tax credits and the remaining deferred tax asset is dependent upon achieving future forecasted taxable income. If actual results are significantly less than our forecast, an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the remaining net deferred tax assets, which totaled $2,601 at September 30, 2010. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a material impact on our future earnings and financial position. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in various tax jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues based upon our estimate of whether additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine that the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge of income tax expense would result. Pension plans: Our retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and their related obligations will inherently be settled far in future periods. Therefore, the ultimate amount of those obligations is subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. Because the assumption regarding the rate of return on plan assets is a long term estimate, it can differ materially from the actual return realized on plan assets in any given year, particularly when markets are highly volatile. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that the rates we use are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are in place, as well as the plans asset allocation between equities and fixed income investments. Assumed discount rates are used in measurements of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, and the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost. See Note H to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The discount rate for the United States plan was determined as of the September 30, 2010, measurement date by constructing a portfolio of bonds with cash flows from coupon payments and maturities matching the projected benefit payments under the Plan. Bonds considered in constructing the model portfolio are rated AA or higher by Standard Poors. Callable bonds were excluded from consideration in this analysis. The longest maturity of any bond included in the data is August 15, 2037. Benefit payments beyond 2037 were discounted back to this year using interest rates taken from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve Comparison to Above Median as of September 30, 2010. The matching bond portfolio produces coupon income in excess of what is needed to meet early period benefit payments. The excess coupon income is accumulated as interest, based on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve Comparison to Above Median as of September 30, 2010, until such time as it is used to pay benefits. The discount rates used in determining the recorded liability as of year end for our United States pension plan were 5.375% for 2010, 6.0% for 2009 and 7.0% for 2008. The 62.5 and 100 basis point decrease from 2009 to 2010 and 2008 to 2009, respectively, reflects the decline in interest rates stemming from the global economic crisis that began in late fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2010; this situation pushed bond yields lower than previous levels. The discount rates for our German pension plan were 4.5% for 2010, 6.5% for 2009 and 6.25% for 2008. The decrease in the fiscal 2010 rate reflects the reduction in yields for corporate bonds during the year. The slight increase in the fiscal 2009 rate reflects the change in spread between government and highly rated Corporate bond yields for Euro instruments having durations similar to the German pension liability. Actual rate of return on United States plan assets was 11.1% for fiscal 2010 compared to an expected rate of return of 8.0%. A 0.25% increase (decrease) in the expected rate of return would have produced a $116 decrease (increase) in fiscal 2010 expense. 16 Table of Contents The pension plan assets in Germany are invested through an insurance company. The insurance company directs the investments for this insurance contract. Because of the type of investments in the insurance contract, an expected rate of return of 4.5% was assumed. Management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions for both the United States plan and the non U.S. plans based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Pension income or expense is allocated to Cost of goods sold, Selling, general and administrative expenses, and Product development expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Stock compensation plans: We grant non cash compensation in the form of non qualified stock options, performance award units and restricted share units. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, the Company applies the Black Scholes option pricing model. Inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, option life, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. While risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions, typically based on factual data derived from public sources, the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates. We use an expected stock price volatility assumption primarily based upon observed historical volatility of Keithleys stock price, as there is not a substantial enough market for exchange traded options. For stock options granted during fiscal year 2010, we used a stock price volatility assumption of 63%. With regard to the weighted average expected option life assumption, we consider several factors, including the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, historical cancellation rates of past options, and the current life of options outstanding and vested. During fiscal year 2010, we used an expected life assumption of 4.75 years. We also are required to estimate an expected forfeiture rate when recognizing compensation cost. We review this rate during each reporting period and adjust it when necessary based upon our past history of actual forfeitures. The total estimated unrecognized compensation at September 30, 2010 was $1,658 and was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years. The final number of common shares to be issued pursuant to the performance award units is determined at the end of each three year performance period. The awards granted in fiscal year 2008 vested on September 30, 2010. The performance criteria related to these awards were met and resulted in a payout at 100 percent of target in November 2010 for those awards measured on return on assets. Additionally, it was determined that the subset of these awards measured on return on invested capital achieved a payout at 125 percent of target and were issued accordingly in November 2010. The awards granted in fiscal year 2008 could be adjusted in 25 percent increments and ranged from a maximum of twice the initial award, as specified in the agreement, to a minimum of zero units depending upon the level of attainment of performance thresholds. During fiscal 2010, we recorded expenses of $1,099 relating to the 2008 2010 awards. We granted no performance award units during fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, the Company granted performance award units to officers and key employees. The performance award unit agreements provide for the award of performance units with each unit representing the right to receive one of the Companys Common Shares to be issued after the applicable award period. The final number of units awarded for this grant was to be determined, as of September 30, 2012, based upon the Companys total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the Russell MicroCap Index and could range from a minimum of no units to a maximum of twice the initial award. The weighted average fair value for these performance units was $6.73 and was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following assumptions: Risk free interest rate 1.25 % Volatility 78 % The Company recognizes the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the performance period, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period. During fiscal 2010, we recorded expenses of $164 relating to the 2010 2012 awards. Our future earnings can fluctuate throughout the performance period specified in the agreements depending upon our estimate of the number of awards we expect will be issued upon the completion of the performance period. Restructuring and cost reduction programs: We expense costs associated with exit and disposal activities designed to restructure operations and reduce ongoing costs of operations when we incur the related liabilities or when other triggering events occur. After the appropriate level of management having the authority approves the detailed cost reduction or restructuring plan, we establish accruals for underlying activities by estimating employee termination costs. Our estimates are based upon factors including affected employees length of service, any statutory requirements, contract provisions, salary level, and health care benefit choices. As part of our assessment of exit and disposal activities, we also analyze the carrying value of any affected long lived assets for impairment and reductions in the estimated useful lives. We believe our estimates and assumptions used to calculate the costs associated with these restructuring provisions are appropriate, and although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual costs could differ from the estimates should we make changes to the nature or timing of the plans. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Percent of net sales for the years ended September 30: 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 35.2 43.8 41.1 Inventory write off and accelerated depreciation for exit of product line 0.0 2.5 0.0 Gross profit 64.8 53.7 58.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 38.1 48.4 43.6 Product development expenses 9.6 17.6 16.7 Gain on the sale of RF product line (2.3 ) Gain on the sale of building (1.5 ) Severance and related charges 6.8 0.9 Operating income (loss) 20.9 (19.1 ) (2.3 ) Investment income 0.1 0.3 1.0 Interest expense (0.1 ) Transaction costs associated with pending merger (1.0 ) Impairment of long term investments (1.7 ) Earnings (loss) before income taxes 20.0 (18.9 ) (3.0 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 0.4 30.4 (1.3 ) Net income (loss) 19.6 % (49.3 )% (1.7 )% We recorded net income of $24,878, or $1.53 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010, and net losses of $50,504, or $3.23 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009 and $2,593, or $0.16 per diluted share, for fiscal 2008. Net sales were $126,870 in 2010 compared with $102,527 in 2009 and $152,468 in 2008. The 24 percent increase in sales in 2010 was substantially driven by stronger customer demand, including demand for production related applications as well as an increase in large dollar orders compared the prior year. The weak worldwide economic conditions that began during the latter part of fiscal 2008 intensified considerably in the first quarter of 2009 as the U.S. financial markets froze and persisted throughout the duration of fiscal 2009 as global markets reacted and responded. Our customers responded with reduced demand in fiscal 2009 for products in all industries and all geographic regions served. On a relative basis, demand in fiscal 2009 for products used in research and development declined from fiscal 2008 levels less significantly than demand for products used in production for our customers in each of the semiconductor, wireless and precision electronics industries. Geographically, fiscal 2010 sales increased 26 percent in the Americas, 35 percent in Asia and 9 percent in Europe, all as compared to our respective 2009 results. For fiscal 2009, sales declined 29 percent in the Americas, 34 percent in Asia and likewise fell 35 percent in Europe, all as compared to our respective 2008 results. The effect of a weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted sales growth by approximately one percentage point in fiscal 2010 and four percentage points in fiscal 2008. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively affected sales by two percentage points in fiscal 2009. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 35.2%, 43.8% and 41.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in costs as a percentage of sales in 2010 was driven by the increase in sales volumes, favorable product mix and lower manufacturing costs primarily as a result of the various cost cutting measures undertaken in fiscal 2009 and the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase in costs as a percentage of sales in 2009 was driven by the lower sales volumes that were not fully offset by these cost cutting measures. During 2009, we exited our S600 product line, and as a result, recorded $2,540 of charges for inventory write offs and accelerated depreciation on related production equipment. Foreign exchange hedging had a minimal effect on Cost of goods sold in 2009, 2008, and 2007. 18 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses of $48,385 declined $1,379, or three percent, in 2010 as compared to 2009 levels, and decreased 16,649, or 25 percent in 2009 from $66,413 in 2008. The decrease in 2010 over 2009 was the result of cost reductions put in place in 2009 offset by the restoration of employee compensation to full levels beginning January 1, 2010 and the reinstatement of the 401(k) match retroactive to January 1, 2010 as well as $1,099 in fiscal 2010 of stock based compensation expense for performance based stock awards that were previously not expected to payout. The sharp decline in 2009 was principally attributable to worldwide headcount reductions and other concerted cost containment measures which began in September 2008 and continued throughout the entirety of fiscal 2009. Additionally, we recorded reversals of $950 during fiscal 2009 for previously accrued performance based stock awards that either did not vest during fiscal 2009 or were no longer expected to vest due to the poor financial performance. Product development expenses of $12,145 in 2010 decreased 33 percent from $18,024 in 2009 and decreased 29 percent in 2009 from $25,504 in 2008. The decline from 2009 to 2010 was attributable to targeted reductions in spending coupled with headcount reduction related to the sale of the RF product line. The decline from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to targeted reductions in spending coupled with headcount reductions in response to lower customer demand, as well as the aforementioned exit of the S600 product line. During fiscal 2010, we recorded $2,894 for the gain on the sale of substantially all of the Companys RF assets to Agilent. Additionally, we recorded $1,862 for the gain on the sale of a facility located on Bainbridge Road in Solon, Ohio, during fiscal 2010. No such gains were realized during fiscal 2009 or 2008. During 2010, we recorded $124 of income for the reversal of previously accrued expenses related to the 2009 severance and related charges. In 2009, we recorded expenses of $6,926 for costs associated with severance and related charges compared to expenses of $1,377 in 2008 for costs associated with the first reduction in our global workforce. See Note K for further discussion. Investment income was $95 in 2010, $303 in 2009 and $1,603 in 2008. The 2010 reduction from 2009 levels was driven mostly by a more conservative investment portfolio comprised principally of certificates of deposits and money market funds. The 2009 reduction from 2008 levels was driven mostly by lower average cash and investment levels coupled with a more conservative investment portfolio comprised principally of certificates of deposits and money market funds. See Note D for further details. Interest expense was $23 in 2010, $52 in 2009 and $70 in 2008. During fiscal 2010, we recorded $1,250 for transaction costs associated with the pending merger with Danaher. These costs were incurred primarily for legal fees and strategic advisory expenses. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010, including discrete items, was two percent, and was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because we recognized income in the U.S. with no corresponding tax expense as a result of fully reserved tax assets and benefited from the carryback of the net operating losses generated in fiscal 2009. We also recorded tax expense on certain profitable foreign jurisdictions. See Note J for further discussion. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009, including discrete items, was 161 percent, and was substantially driven by a valuation allowance of $29,967 recorded in the first quarter against U.S. deferred tax assets, as well as $6,307 of tax expense on a U.S. loss without tax benefit. We also recorded tax expense on certain profitable foreign jurisdictions. See Note J for further discussion. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008, including discrete items, was a benefit of 42.8 percent. The effective benefit in 2008 was greater than the U.S. statutory rate due to the recognition of current year research tax credits, state and local tax benefits and the recognition of benefits associated with prior year adjustments. These benefits were partially offset by the net impact of losses in foreign jurisdiction which are not available for a tax benefit and U.S. tax on foreign remittances. See Note J for further discussion. Our financial results are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Generally, a weakening U.S. dollar versus foreign currency favorably impacts our foreign currency denominated sales. A strengthening U.S. dollar has an unfavorable effect. This foreign exchange effect cannot be precisely isolated since many other factors affect our foreign sales and earnings. These factors include product offerings and pricing policies of Keithley and our competition, whether competition is foreign or U.S. based, changes in technology, product and customer mix, and local and worldwide economic conditions. We utilize hedging techniques designed to mitigate the short term effect of exchange rate fluctuations on operations and balance sheet positions by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts. We do not speculate in foreign currencies or derivative financial instruments, and hedging techniques do not increase our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 19 Table of Contents Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital The following table summarizes working capital as of September 30: 2010 2009 Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 50,790 $ 24,114 Restricted cash 537 569 Short term investments 3,912 759 Refundable income taxes 1,030 466 Accounts receivable and other, net 19,111 11,738 Total inventories 9,072 9,937 Deferred income taxes 659 303 Other current assets 1,518 1,753 Total current assets 86,629 49,639 Current liabilities: Short term debt Accounts payable 5,903 4,916 Accrued payroll and related expenses 11,602 5,648 Other accrued expenses 5,166 5,424 Income taxes payable 2,622 1,122 Total current liabilities 25,293 17,110 Working capital $ 61,336 $ 32,529 Working capital increased during fiscal year 2010 by $28,807, substantially driven by a $36,990 increase in current assets from September 30, 2009. The increase in current assets was caused by the combined effect of $26,676 increase in Cash and cash equivalents, driven primarily by operating activities and proceeds from the sale of the RF product line and Bainbridge Road facility in Solon, Ohio, $3,153 of more short term investments and $7,373 of higher accounts receivable resulting from increased customer sales. Current liabilities increased from 2009 to 2010 by $8,183. The increased levels in current liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in accrued employee incentives and sales commissions. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table is a summary of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 18,904 $ (5,416 ) $ 1,706 Investing activities 8,966 9,178 16,031 Financing activities (1,374 ) (2,029 ) (8,844 ) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $18,904 in fiscal year 2010 compared to cash used in operations of $5,416 for fiscal year 2009. Cash from operating activities is net income (loss) adjusted for certain non cash expenses and changes in assets and liabilities. During fiscal year 2010, operating cash flows resulted primarily from a net income of $24,878 offset by an increase in accounts receivable, deferred income taxes and the gain on the sale of assets $7,384, $1,168 and $4,755, respectively, and augmented by non cash charges from depreciation, stock based compensation and accrued employee incentives. We also made a $2,000 contribution to our U.S. pension plan. During fiscal 2009, the net use of cash in operating activities stemmed primarily from the net loss which was not fully offset by non cash charges and reductions in working capital. We also made $750 of voluntary contributions to our U.S. pension plan. During fiscal year 2008, operating cash flows resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts receivable, and the positive impact of non cash charges from depreciation, stock based compensation and assets impairment charges. This was partially offset by non cash charges for deferred taxes, an increase in inventory, and $1,500 in contributions to the Companys U.S. pension plan in fiscal 2008. 20 Table of Contents Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $8,966 in fiscal year 2010 compared to $9,178 in fiscal year 2009. Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the sale of assets related to the RF product line and the Bainbridge Facility, the purchase and sale of investments and purchases of property, plant and equipment. Capital spending declined to $713 in 2010 from $1,994 in 2009 as we curtailed spending in response to the difficult economic conditions experienced throughout the prior year. In 2010, the Company had proceeds from the sale of assets totaling $12,800. This was comprised of the completed sale of the RF product line assets to Agilent for a cash purchase price of $9,000 and $3,800 for the sale of the Companys Bainbridge Facility. We purchased $3,153 of short term investments in fiscal year 2010 versus $759 in fiscal year 2009, while sales of short term investments generated $0 in cash in fiscal 2010 versus $12,500 last year. As a result, during fiscal 2010 we increased investments due to an increase in overall cash by $3,153, compared to liquidating approximately $11,741 of investments to provide cash for operations and other activities in fiscal year 2009. The increase in these investment activities directly relate to the improved operational performance in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009. Additionally, in fiscal year 2009 we used $569 in connection with pledges against outstanding letters of credit as required under our existing credit arrangement. See Note E for details. Financing activities. Cash used for financing activities in fiscal year 2010 was $1,374 versus $2,029 in fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased $12 of our Common Shares compared to $787 in fiscal year 2009. See Note C for further details. Cash dividends in fiscal year 2010 of $1,535 were comparable with the $1,521 incurred in fiscal year 2009. The Company amended its credit agreement in March 2010. The revised facility consisted of a $5,000 debt facility ($0 outstanding at September 30, 2010) that provided unsecured, multi currency revolving credit at various interest rates based on Prime or LIBOR. The agreement did not contain debt covenants, but required cash to be pledged against outstanding borrowings and stand by letters of credit. We were required to pay a facility fee of 0.25% per annum on the total amount of the commitment. The expiration date had been extended to March 31, 2012, but the credit agreement was terminated on December 8, 2010. The Company had a number of other such credit facilities in various currencies and for standby letters of credit aggregating $1,734 ($83 outstanding at September 30, 2010). At September 30, 2010, we had total unused lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks aggregating $6,114. See Note E for further details. Under certain provisions of the former debt agreement, we were required to comply with various financial ratios and covenants. Our stock repurchase program expired on February 28, 2009 and was not renewed or replaced. Accordingly, we have been unable to repurchase Common Shares since such date. See Note C for more details. During 2011, we expect to finance capital spending and working capital requirements with cash and short term investments on hand and cash provided by operations. Set forth below is a table of information with respect to the Companys contractual obligations as of September 30, 2010: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Short Term Debt $ $ $ $ $ Operating Lease Obligations (a) 5,367 1,890 2,081 786 610 Payments Under Deferred Compensation Agreements (b) 2,250 193 296 156 1,605 Pension Benefits (c) (c ) (c ) (c ) Non cancelable Purchase Commitments $ 288 $ 288 Total Contractual Obligations $ 7,905 $ 2,371 $ 2,377 $ 942 $ 2,215 (a) Agilent assumed the Santa Rosa lease associated with the RF product line: however, the Company remains a guarantor in the event of default. Agilent will indemnify the Company for any amounts paid by the Company to the landlord in event of any default. Accordingly, obligations of approximately $305 and $178 under that lease are not included in the above table as they are not expected to be incurred by the Company for fiscal 2011 and 2012, respectively. (b) Includes amounts due under deferred compensation agreements with current and former employees. At September 30, 2010, investment in insurance assets to fund future deferred compensation payments were $1,842. Amounts exclude additional interest and investment gains or losses that may be earned or incurred from September 30, 2010 through the time of payment. (c) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of September 30, 2010. The Company made a voluntary pension contribution of $2,000 in fiscal 2010, and a $2,000 contribution was made in October 2010 to satisfy the requirement for fiscal 2011. No further contributions are anticipated. We are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond 2011 due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, including interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns; what, if any, changes may occur in legislation; and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions. 21 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued guidance which allows companies to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company adopted the guidance effective October 1, 2008, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued updates to guidance, amending and expanding the disclosure requirements related to the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities to provide improved transparency into the uses and financial statement impact of derivative instruments and hedging activities. The new disclosure provisions were adopted by the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note F for the required disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys results of operations. The Company adopted the guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Adoption did not have an effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) to serve as the single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP. The ASC supersedes all the existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and, subsequently, the FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. The guidance is not intended to change or alter existing U.S. GAAP. The guidance became effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Adoption did not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which establishes general standards for accounting and disclosure of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to issuance of the financial statements. The guidance is not intended to result in significant change to current practice. The Company adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Adoption did not have an effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance that requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company adopted the presentation requirements of the guidance in fiscal 2007, which resulted in a net charge to other comprehensive income of $1,975. We adopted the measurement date provisions in fiscal 2009, and as a result, recorded a charge of $105 to retained earnings. See Note H for additional information related to the change in measurement date provisions. In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance is applicable to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, the guidance did not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application changed current practice. The guidance became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. However, the FASB provided a one year deferral for the implementation for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The Company adopted the guidance effective October 1, 2008, except with respect to nonfinancial assets and liabilities, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company adopted the guidance related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective October 1, 2009, which resulted in expanded disclosures in its consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued updates to the guidance that is intended to improve disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2010. Adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The updates are effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company the adopted the guidance effective July 1, 2010. Adoption did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance that address accounting for variable interest entities.

The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 13, updates to address revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that include software elements. The new guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal 2011. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 17, updates to address revenue recognition for arrangements in which a vendor satisfies its performance obligations over time, with all or a portion of the consideration contingent on future events, referred to as milestones.

ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its short term investments. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rates. The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We currently utilize foreign exchange forward contracts or option contracts to sell foreign currencies to fix the exchange rates related to near term sales and effectively fix our margins. Generally, these contracts have maturities of three months or less. Our policy is to only enter into derivative transactions when we have an identifiable exposure to risk, thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk. In our opinion, a 10 percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments nor, therefore, on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting primarily of various money market funds and certificates of deposit (CDs) with numerous institutions and differing maturity dates. A decline in interest rates would generally not change the value of these investments as they mature, but would decrease earnings on future CDs purchased with cash or proceeds from other matured CDs. During fiscal 2010, the amount of short term investments has increased in terms of both dollars and as a percentage of total current assets. However, in managements opinion, a 10 percent decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 23 Table of Contents
