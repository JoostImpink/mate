ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL The Company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs other than drilling costs for successful wells, including geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether each well resulted in the discovery of proved reserves. If proved reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are charged to expense. Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized. Internal costs related to the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and gas properties are expensed as incurred. Interest is capitalized on qualifying assets, primarily unproved and unevaluated properties. The Company anticipates that results of operations will continue to be significantly impacted by the level of exploration expenditures and the costs of drilling dry exploratory wells that are expensed under the successful efforts method of accounting. Depletion of the cost of producing oil and gas properties is computed on the unit of production method. The Company also accrues for platform abandonment costs related to its offshore platform facilities on the unit of production method. Unproved properties are assessed periodically, and any impairment in value is recognized currently as impairment expense. As of December 31, 1996, the Company owned unproved oil and gas properties with a book value of approximately $33 million. The Company plans to commence drilling on its most significant prospects in 1997; however, if such drilling activity does not result in the discovery of proved oil and gas reserves on a particular property, an impairment charge would be recorded to write off the value of that property. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 1996 COMPARED TO 1995 REVENUES. The Company recorded oil and gas sales totaling $76.2 million in 1996 compared to 1995 sales of $70.8 million. Higher sales revenues primarily reflected a 17% increase in the Companys average realized gas price in 1996. The oil and gas industry enjoyed strong commodity prices for most of 1996, although the benefit of higher prices on the Companys revenues was mitigated by the impact of certain price hedging arrangements in effect during the year. The Companys 1996 revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $7.2 million due to the effect of higher oil and gas prices compared to the prior year. The Companys gas price averaged $2.03 per Mcf in 1996 compared to $1.74 per Mcf in 1995, while the average oil price realized rose slightly to $17.21 per Bbl in 1996 from $16.83 per Bbl a year earlier. During 1996, the Company had in effect certain commodity price hedging agreements that covered, on average throughout the year, approximately 47% of its gas production and approximately 68% of its oil production. As a result of the price hedges, the Companys oil and gas sales revenues were reduced by approximately $10 million during 1996 and were increased by approximately $1.5 million during 1995. Excluding the impact of the hedging arrangements, the Companys average oil and gas prices for 1996 would have been $20.31 per Bbl and $2.23 per Mcf, respectively. For 1995, the Companys average prices exclusive of the hedges would have been $16.79 per Bbl and $1.68 per Mcf. Oil production increased to 1.8 MMBOE during 1996 reflecting a 6% increase in the Companys average daily production rate. Production increases in 1996 were primarily attributable to properties acquired in the Offshore Acquisitions, which added approximately 200,000 Bbls of oil production in 1996. The impact of additional volumes from the new properties was partially offset by the effect of the sales of several oil producing properties in late 1995 and early 1996. Increased oil production contributed approximately $1.8 million to 1996 revenues. Gas production in 1996 declined to 22.4 Bcf or approximately 9% below prior year volumes of 24.5 Bcf. Production declines in 1996 aggregating 6.5 Bcf due to the sale of the Sawyer Field in July 1995 (the "Sawyer Sale") and production declines in the West McAllen Field were offset by an additional 3.4 Bcf of gas production from the properties acquired in the Offshore Acquisitions, an increase of 1.1 Bcf resulting from the installation of additional compression and pipeline facilities at the Bradshaw Field, and an increase of 0.7 Bcf from the completion of a well at High Island Block 13 L. The reduction in gas volumes negatively impacted sales by approximately $3.6 million in 1996. 19 22 The Company recognized a net gain of $978,000 on the sales of various properties during 1996. In 1995, the Company reported a net gain on property sales, mainly the Sawyer Sale, of approximately $10.2 million. Other revenues totaling $281,000 in 1996 primarily represented the proceeds from the sales of seismic data. In 1995, other revenues of $969,000 related to a certain gas contract settlement and gas balancing income offset by the accrual of a loss under certain swap agreements then in effect. See "1995 Compared to 1994" below. COSTS AND EXPENSES. Production and operating costs totaled $25.7 million, or $4.65 per BOE, in 1996 compared to $29.4 million, or $5.12 per BOE, in 1995. The decrease in total costs was primarily attributable to the reduction of approximately $3.4 million related to the Sawyer Field, while the decline in the Companys operating costs per unit of production was mainly attributable to the impact of the offshore properties acquired in 1996. Such properties generally have higher production rates and, therefore, lower operating costs per unit than the Companys onshore properties. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") totaled $29.6 million and $30.7 million for 1996 and 1995, respectively. The decline in DD&A expense was mainly attributable to lower gas production in 1996. The Companys average DD&A rate was essentially unchanged during 1996 despite generally higher depletion rates for the offshore properties acquired in 1996, which rates reflect a provision for platform abandonment costs. As prescribed by applicable accounting standards, no depreciation or depletion expense was recorded during the last half of 1996 for certain assets that had been reclassified to assets held for sale at the end of the second quarter. Those assets were sold during the fourth quarter of 1996. General and administrative ("G&A") expense totaling $7.2 million was 13% below the prior year expense of $8.3 million. The decline in G&A expense was mainly attributable to reduced legal fees in 1996. G&A expense per unit of production averaged $1.31 per BOE in 1996 compared to $1.44 per BOE in 1995. Exploration expense totaled $18.8 million in 1996 and $6.6 million in 1995. The Company drilled 32 exploratory wells in 1996, with a 50% success rate, compared to only three wells in 1995, all of which were unsuccessful. Accordingly, the Company recorded dry hole expense of $11.4 million in 1996 compared to $4.1 million for the prior year. In addition, 1996 exploration expense included $5.1 million of geological and geophysical expense primarily reflecting the costs of 3 D seismic data covering certain areas in the Texas State Waters and South Texas. Impairment expense for unproved properties upon which no further exploration activity will be conducted totaled $2.1 million and $1.8 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively. Interest expense of $4.2 million in 1996 declined 23% from the prior year. Interest expense in 1995 reflected higher bank debt carried in the first half of 1995 following the completion of the APPL Consolidation. The income tax provision for 1996 primarily represented deferred state income tax expense. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM. The $2.5 million extraordinary gain recorded in 1995 resulted from the extinguishment of nonrecourse debt in conjunction with the APPL Consolidation. NET INCOME (LOSS). The Company reported a net loss of $8.6 million, or $0.84 per share, in 1996 and net income of $3.9 million, or $0.18 per share, in 1995. The 1996 loss was mainly attributable to dry hole and seismic data acquisition costs totaling $16.5 million. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells and seismic data expenditures are expensed as incurred. Net income in 1995 reflected the impact of numerous nonrecurring transactions, most notably a $10.2 million gain on property sales, primarily the Sawyer Sale, and a $2.5 million extraordinary gain on debt extinguishment. 1995 COMPARED TO 1994 REVENUES. Oil and gas sales totaled $70.8 million in 1995 or 41% higher than 1994 sales of $50 million. The increase in 1995 sales revenues primarily reflected higher production volumes that resulted from the acquisition of investors interests in the APPL Programs. Through the APPL Consolidation, the Company acquired 22.9 MMBOE and 2.3 MMBOE of proved oil and gas reserves in late 1994 and early 1995, respectively. The APPL Consolidation, together with successful development activity at the Midway and West McAllen fields and the West Cameron Block 408, resulted in a net production increase of 1.8 MMBOE in 1995 compared to 1994. The higher production levels achieved through the APPL Consolidation were partially offset by the loss of production due to the Sawyer Sale. The Companys total oil 20 23 and gas production increased to 5.8 MMBOE in 1995 from 3.9 MMBOE in 1994, contributing $22.3 million to oil and gas sales. Oil and gas sales reflected the impact of lower gas prices offset by higher oil prices received in 1995. The Company realized an average price of $16.83 per Bbl in 1995 compared to $15.39 in 1994, which resulted in a $2.4 million addition to sales revenues. The Companys average gas price realization declined to $1.74 per Mcf in 1995, or 8% below the prior year average. The decline in the average gas price negatively impacted sales revenues by $3.9 million. During 1995 and 1994, the Company had periodically entered into certain price hedging arrangements, primarily related to a portion of its natural gas production. The Company realized a $1.5 million gain on its hedging activities in both 1995 and 1994, which gains were reflected in the oil and gas sales revenues of each year. Excluding the impact of the hedging gains, the Companys average price per Mcf of gas would have been $1.68 and $1.81 in 1995 and 1994, respectively. Oil prices were not significantly affected by price hedging agreements in either year. In July 1995, the Company sold its interest in the Sawyer Field to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp. for a purchase price of $64 million. American recorded a gain on the Sawyer Sale of approximately $10.6 million in 1995. Sales of various other fields in 1995 resulted in a net loss of approximately $400,000. In 1994, the Company recognized a $1.1 million gain on the divestiture of minor properties. Other revenues totaled $969,000 and $216,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively. In 1995, the Company recorded gas settlement income of $895,000, primarily consisting of the proceeds from certain litigation regarding the terms of a gas purchase contract. American also recognized approximately $480,000 of gas balancing income during 1995, primarily relating to cash balancing settlements receivable on various wells that were plugged and abandoned during 1995. During December 1995, the Company accrued $700,000 as a reduction of other revenues due to the loss of correlation between actual cash prices and the prices under the swap agreements at the Henry Hub market reference price. Other revenues recorded in 1994 primarily included gas balancing income. COSTS AND EXPENSES. Production and operating costs increased to $29.4 million in 1995 from $25.9 million in 1994. The increase in 1995 costs was mainly attributable to higher production levels resulting from the APPL Consolidation, although that increase was mitigated by a reduction in environmental expenses in 1995. During 1994, the Company incurred $2.4 million of site remediation costs in connection with various environmental proceedings. On a unit cost basis, production and operating costs per BOE decreased to $5.12 per BOE in 1995 from $6.57 per BOE in 1994 reflecting continued operating efficiencies achieved following the completion of the APPL Consolidation. DD&A totaled $30.7 million in 1995 or 4% over 1994 DD&A of $29.6 million. The Companys DD&A per BOE rate decreased substantially in 1995; consequently, Americans DD&A expense did not increase proportionately with the 46% production increase in 1995. DD&A per BOE decreased to $5.34 per BOE in 1995 from $7.50 per BOE in 1994. The lower DD&A rate reflected the effect of the acquisition of interests through the APPL Consolidation and the impact of a $25 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 1994, which reduced the cost basis of certain oil and gas properties. G&A expense declined to $8.3 million in 1995 from $11.1 million a year earlier. The reduction in G&A expense resulted primarily from staff reductions in the first half of 1994 and a $2 million severance charge recorded in late 1994 in connection with the elimination of certain partnerships managed by American. These decreases were partially offset by the loss of management and technical fee reimbursements previously received from the APPL Programs. The Companys continuing focus on controlling administrative costs resulted in a 49% reduction in G&A expense per unit of production, which averaged $1.44 per BOE in 1995 compared to $2.82 per BOE in 1994. Exploration expense totaled $6.6 million and $11.1 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively. American recognized $4.1 million of dry hole expense on three wells in 1995, including two offshore wells, and recorded $1.8 million of impairment expense in 1995 related primarily to the fourth quarter write off of an unproved offshore property. In 1994, the Company recorded $1.5 million of dry hole expense related to three unsuccessful wells and $8.6 million of impairment expense, including a $6.4 million charge to write off Americans remaining leasehold interest in Tunisia. The Company also recorded a $25 million impairment charge in 1994 related to a change in accounting policy. Interest expense of $5.5 million in 1995 was 17% below 1994 expense of $6.6 million primarily due to the repayment of $62.5 million of bank debt using the proceeds of the Sawyer Sale in July 1995. In addition, American 21 24 extinguished certain nonrecourse debt associated with the APPL Programs totaling $6.6 million and $13.6 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively. Other expense of $2.6 million in 1994 included $2.1 million of fees paid by American in connection with a new bank credit agreement and a bridge facility with New York Life. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM. American recorded extraordinary gains of $2.5 million in 1995 and $5.4 million in 1994 related to the elimination of nonrecourse debt in conjunction with the APPL Consolidation. The gain represented the difference between the outstanding note balances and the actual purchase price of the notes. NET INCOME (LOSS). American reported net income of $3.9 million, or $0.18 per share, in 1995 and a net loss of $54.8 million, or $7.02 per share, in 1994. Nonrecurring transactions reflected in 1995 net income included a $10.2 million gain on property sales, primarily the Sawyer Sale, a $2.5 million extraordinary gain on the extinguishment of debt and $895,000 of gas settlement income, partially negated by a $1.8 million impairment charge and a $700,000 loss related to certain natural gas hedges. In contrast, 1994 results included the negative impact of a $33.6 million impairment charge partially offset by a $5.4 million extraordinary gain and a $1.1 million gain on property sales. Excluding the effect of these nonrecurring transactions in both years, the Company would have recorded net losses of $7.2 million and $27.7 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The improvement in operating results primarily reflected a $17.5 million increase in net operating revenues, which resulted from higher production levels and reduced unit operating costs following the APPL Consolidation. In addition, reductions in G&A and interest expense in 1995 more than offset higher DD&A and exploration expense recorded in that year. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Americans principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing activities. During the last two years, the Company has also generated substantial cash flows from the sale of oil and gas properties, most notably the Sawyer Sale in 1995. Americans primary capital requirements are to fund the Companys development and exploration programs and acquisition activity. American also has financial obligations related to the Companys convertible preferred stock and its 11% senior subordinated notes (the "Subordinated Notes"). Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $35.4 million in 1996, $33.3 million in 1995 and $7.7 million in 1994. Cash flow for 1996 reflected improved operating margins due to strong oil and gas prices and the impact of lower operating costs for the Companys offshore properties, which represented a greater portion of the property base in 1996. Net cash provided by operating activities was reduced in 1996 by the effect of a $4.1 million negative working capital change due to a higher accounts receivable balance at year end 1996. In contrast, net cash provided by operating activities in 1995 reflected a $5.8 million positive working capital adjustment due to an increase in the accounts payable balance at year end 1995. Excluding the impact of working capital adjustments, the Companys cash flow from operations increased by approximately $10 million from 1995 to 1996. The improvement in operating cash flows in 1995 compared to 1994 reflected the impact of the APPL Consolidation and successful development activity, which together resulted in a 46% increase in 1995 production relative to 1994. In addition, the Companys operating margins increased in 1995 as unit costs for production, G&A and interest expense decreased in 1995 as compared to 1994. As of December 31, 1996, the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement was $75 million, and outstanding bank debt totaled $25 million, all of which was classified as long term. The borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined semiannually every March and September. The March 1997 redetermination is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 1997. The Credit Agreement and the Subordinated Notes require the Company to comply with certain covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on indebtedness, investments, payment of dividends and lease commitments and a requirement to maintain a minimum net worth of $88.5 million. Cash dividends are restricted on the Companys common stock, and annual preferred dividends are limited to 10% of the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time, not to exceed $7.5 million. The current annual limit on preferred dividends is $2 million. In addition, these agreements contain cross default provisions. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at year end 1996. In November 1996, the Company closed the sale of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock in a public offering that generated net proceeds to the Company of approximately $46 million. Proceeds from the stock offering were used to reduce outstanding bank debt. 22 25 Proceeds from the sales of oil and gas properties totaled approximately $16.9 million, $63.5 million and $2.6 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. In December 1996, the Company received approximately $10.1 million, subject to post closing adjustments, from the divestiture of certain properties in connection with the NYLOG Liquidation. Also in 1996, the Company sold, for approximately $5.8 million, a 10% interest in High Island Block 116, which American had purchased in the September 1996 Acquisition. Property sales in 1995 primarily included the Sawyer Sale for gross proceeds of $64 million. The Sawyer Sale proceeds were applied to substantially reduce the Companys outstanding bank debt, which had increased as a result of the APPL Consolidation. Divestitures in 1994 were comprised of non strategic, low value properties. Cash expenditures for the acquisition of oil and gas properties totaled approximately $74 million in 1996, $16 million in 1995 and $28 million in 1994. Acquisition expenditures in 1996 included approximately $14 million for the March 1996 Acquisition, $45 million for the September 1996 Acquisition and approximately $7.7 million for the Ancon Acquisition. The remainder of the 1996 acquisition expenditures primarily related to the purchase of leasehold interests including acreage in the Cotton Valley area of East Texas and in the Yoakum Gorge area of South Texas. In 1995, the Company expended approximately $9 million related to the APPL Consolidation and $2.4 million for certain interests in the Buckner Field in Arkansas and also purchased several offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. Property acquisitions in 1994 mainly related to the APPL Consolidation. Cash expenditures for development totaled approximately $15.6 million, $23.3 million and $15.3 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. American participated in drilling 52 development wells (14 net) in 1996, of which 48 (13 net) were successfully completed. Development activity in 1996 was focused in the Companys offshore operating area including High Island Block 98 L, the Brazos Complex and the properties acquired in the Offshore Acquisitions. The Company also completed eleven (8.7 net) wells at the Bradshaw Field in Kansas. Cash expenditures for exploration activities totaled approximately $26.1 million in 1996 compared to approximately $4.2 million and $5.6 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company participated in 32 exploratory wells (15 net) in 1996 with a 50% success rate. Exploration efforts were concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Wilcox and Frio trends of South Texas. There can be no assurances regarding the success of any wells drilled, and exploratory wells involve greater risks than development wells. Under successful efforts accounting, the costs incurred for the drilling of unsuccessful exploratory wells and for the acquisition of seismic data are recorded as exploration expense and negatively impact net income in the period in which incurred. The Company expects its 1997 capital expenditures for development and exploration activities to total approximately $80 million. The actual amount of such expenditures will depend on various factors, including, among other factors, oil and gas prices, the level of exploration success and subsequent development activity. The Company intends to fund its planned capital expenditures, commitments and working capital requirements through cash flows from operations and borrowings under the Credit Agreement. However, if there are changes in oil and gas prices, which correspondingly affect cash flows and bank borrowings, or if additional development and exploration opportunities arise, the Company may adjust its capital budget accordingly. Other potential sources of capital for the Company include property sales and financings through the issuance of debt or equity securities. Management believes that the Company will have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund its capital expenditures and meet its financial obligations as they are due. The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, which laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent. The Company has conducted a review of its operations with particular attention to environmental compliance. The Company believes it has acted as a prudent operator and is in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The Company has recorded site remediation costs of $494,000, $541,000 and $2.4 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The site remediation costs incurred in 1994 primarily related to certain lawsuits. American cannot predict what impact environmental laws and regulations will have on its future performance, but does not currently anticipate the incurrence of material environmental expenditures. However, the Company believes that such laws do not affect American in a materially different manner from other similarly situated companies in the oil and gas industry. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.59:1 at the end of 1996 compared to 0.67:1 at year end 1995. The Company historically has operated with a working capital deficit primarily due to timing differences between the receipt of reimbursements from other working interest owners in the properties operated by the Company and the payment of expenses with respect to such properties. 23 26 CHANGING OIL AND GAS PRICES The Companys revenues, cash flow, profitability and future rate of growth, as well as the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile. Various factors beyond the control of the Company affect prices of oil and natural gas, including worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil and gas; political and economic conditions; weather conditions; the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and maintain price and production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions; the price of foreign imports; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of alternative fuels; and changes in existing federal and state regulations. Any significant decline in oil or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations, financial condition and level of development and exploration expenditures and could result in a reduction of the Companys borrowing base under the Credit Agreement, thereby reducing the amount of credit available to the Company to fund its exploration, development and acquisition activities. Part of the Companys business strategy is to reduce its exposure to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices by entering into financial arrangements designed to provide some protection against price declines, including swaps and futures agreements. The Companys objective is to reduce the risk that a sharp drop in oil or natural gas prices will cause the Company to defer various capital spending projects. In certain circumstances, significant reductions in production, due to unforeseen events, could require the Company to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by production. To reduce this risk, the Company strives to hedge less than its expected production. Hedging will also prevent the Company from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the amount specified in the hedge. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had hedges in place that covered approximately 79% of its oil production and approximately 35% of its gas production, based on average daily production during December 1996. For a discussion of hedging arrangements related to 1997 production, reference is made to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. POTENTIAL DILUTION OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP As of December 31, 1996, the Company had approximately 15.7 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, (i) up to approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of the Companys convertible preferred stock, at a conversion price of $15.00 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, (ii) approximately 1.2 million shares are issuable upon exercise of stock options outstanding at December 31, 1996 at prices ranging from $11.50 to $40.00 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $13.53 per share, and (iii) approximately 1.6 million shares are issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding at December 31, 1996 at a weighted average exercise price of $16.16 per share.
