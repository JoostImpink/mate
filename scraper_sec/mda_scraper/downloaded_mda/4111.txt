ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Cautionary Note on Forward Looking Statements Some of the matters discussed under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation, Business, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report include forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, including, among other things: the impact of rapid or persistent fluctuations in the price of coffee beans; fluctuations in the supply of coffee beans; general economic conditions and conditions which affect the market for coffee; our success in implementing our business strategy or introducing new products; our ability to attract and retain customers; our success in expanding our market presence in new geographic regions; the effects of competition from other coffee manufacturers and other beverage alternatives; changes in tastes and preferences for, or the consumption of, coffee; our ability to obtain additional financing; and other risks which we identify in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, could, predict, potential, continue, expect, anticipate, future, intend, plan, believe, estimate and similar expressions (or the negative of such expressions). Any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Consequently, no forward looking statement can be guaranteed. In addition, we undertake no responsibility to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances which occur after the date of this annual report. Overview We are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the United States and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes, preferences and price points. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions. 19 Our operations have primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry: the sale of wholesale specialty green coffee; the roasting, blending, packaging and sale of private label coffee; and the roasting, blending, packaging and sale of our seven brands of coffee. Our operating results are affected by a number of factors including: the level of marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry; our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers; fluctuations in purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling prices of our products; and our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins. Our net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. For this reason, we have made the strategic decision to invest in measures that will increase net sales. In February 2004, we acquired certain assets of Premier Roasters, including equipment and a roasting facility in La Junta, Colorado. We also hired a West Coast Brand Manager to market our S&W brand and to increase sales of S&W coffee to new customers. In March 2006, we entered into a joint venture with Coffee Bean Trading Roasting LLC and formed Caf La Rica, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The joint venture engages in the roasting, packaging and sale of the Caf La Rica brand coffee and other branded and food service coffee products in Miami, Florida. We own 50% of the joint venture and are the primary supplier of its coffee inventory. In April 2006, we entered into a joint venture with Carusos Coffee of Brecksville, Ohio and formed Generations Coffee Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which will engage in the roasting, packaging and sale of private label specialty coffee products. We own 60% of the joint venture and are the exclusive supplier of its coffee inventory. We believe that the Generations Coffee joint venture will allow us to bid on the private label gourmet whole bean business we have not been equipped to pursue from an operational standpoint in the past. With this specialty roasting facility in place, in many cases right in the backyard of our most important wholesale and retail customers, we believe that we are in an ideal position to combine our current canned private label business with high end private label specialty whole bean business. High end specialty whole bean coffee sells for as much as three times more per pound than the canned coffees in which we currently specialize. As a result of these efforts, net sales increased in our specialty green coffee, private label and branded coffee business lines in both dollars and pounds sold. In addition, we increased the number of our customers in all three areas. Our net sales are affected by the price of green coffee. We import green coffee from Colombia, Mexico, Kenya, Brazil and Uganda. The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control. For example, coffee crops in Brazil, which produces one third of the worlds green coffee, are susceptible to frost in June and July and drought in September, October and November. However, because we purchase coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one countrys coffee for another in our products, price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee. Accordingly, price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. Historically, because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers, increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net sales. However, the average indicator price for Robusta coffee, the main component for our leading espresso brands (Caf Caribe and Caf Supremo), increased 104% by August 2006 compared to August of 2005. This indicator price was the highest seen in the last seven years as measured by the International Coffee Organization. By September 2006, prices had achieved further gains, trading to their highest levels in eight years. For competitive reasons, we were not able to pass these price increases through to our customers. As a result, the increases in the price of coffee had the effect of diminishing our profit margins significantly on our leading espresso lines as there were no lower priced coffees to substitute into our blends and we were not able to increase our prices to maintain our margins. In October 2006, national brands reacted to these price increases, raising list prices by $0.12 per unit, and we were able to increase our prices as well. 20 Historically, we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our cost of sales. In addition, we acquire futures contracts with longer terms, generally three to four months, primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices. Although the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices, no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time. In addition, we generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to any futures contracts. If the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses, our cost of sales may increase, resulting in a decrease in profitability. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, income taxes and loss contingencies. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, may be impacted significantly by judgment, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements: We recognize revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104). Under SAB 104, revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss, when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue at the time of shipment. Sales are reflected net of discounts and returns. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments. If there is deterioration of our customers credit worthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used, additional allowances may be required. For example, every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible, would reduce our operating income by approximately $65,000. 21 Inventories are stated at cost (determined on a first in, first out basis). Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are subject to be written down to market value. If our assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write downs of inventories may be required. Each additional one percent of potential inventory writedown would have reduced operating income by approximately $30,000 for the year ended October 31, 2006. We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized. Accordingly, our net deferred tax asset of $208,700 could need to be written off if we do not remain profitable. Year Ended October 31, 2006 (Fiscal 2006) Compared to the Year Ended October 31, 2005 (Fiscal 2005) Net Income. Net income decreased $485,053, or 40.9%, to $700,082 or $.13 per share for the year ended October 31, 2006 compared to $1,185,135 or $.25 per share for the year ended October 31, 2005. The decrease in net income primarily reflects increased cost of sales and operating expenses and a loss by our Caf La Rica joint venture, partially offset by increased net sales. We believe the loss by Caf La Rica, which was formed in March 2006, is consistent with the typical initial performance of a start up venture of this type. Net Sales. Net sales totaled $51,171,202 for the year ended October 31, 2006, an increase of $9,625,857 or 23.2% from $41,545,345 for the year ended October 31, 2005. The increase in net sales reflects a 10.4% increase in coffee pounds sold from 31.6 million pounds in 2005 to 34.9 million pounds in 2006. The increase in pounds of coffee sold is the result of increased sales of our branded and specialty green coffees. Sales of our Caf Caribe brand increased once again and sales of our second Hispanic espresso, Caf Supremo, increased 48%, as measured by Information Resources Incorporated data. The number of our customers in the specialty green coffee area grew approximately 3% to 290 customers. These customers are predominately independent gourmet/specialty roasters, some of whom own their own retail outlets. Sales to new customers in this area historically start slowly because many of these companies are start up ventures. Because the specialty green coffee area is the fastest growing segment of the coffee market, we believe that our customer base and sales will grow in this area. The increase in coffee prices also contributed to the increase in net sales. Cost of Sales. Cost of sales for the year ended October 31, 2006 was $43,575,963 or 85.2% of net sales, as compared to $33,875,973 or 81.5% of net sales for the year ended October 31, 2005. Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity. The increase in cost of sales reflects higher packaging costs associated with the increase in net sales of approximately $300,000 and increased purchases of green coffee in the amount of approximately $5.8 million. The increase in green coffee purchases resulted from increased pounds sold and higher green coffee prices during the period as prices increased $0.23 per pound on the New York Arabica market and $0.27 per pound on the London Robusta market year to year. The average indicator price for Robusta coffee, the main component for our leading espresso brands (Caf Caribe and Caf Supremo), increased 104% by August 2006 compared to August of 2005. This indicator price was the highest seen in the last seven years as measured by the International Coffee Organization. By September 2006, prices had achieved further gains, trading to their highest levels in eight years. For competitive reasons, we were not able to pass these price increases through to our customers. As a result, these increases had the effect of diminishing our profit margins significantly on our leading espresso lines as there were no lower priced coffees to substitute into our blends. In addition, our private label margins were negatively impacted as well, but to a much lesser degree, as Robustas represent only a small percentage of our private label blends. In October 2006, national brands reacted to these price increases, raising list prices by $0.12 per unit. We increased our prices as well. 22 Gross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended October 31, 2006 was $7,595,239, a decrease of $74,133 from $7,669,372 for the year ended October 31, 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 3.7% to 14.8% for the year ended October 31, 2006 from 18.5% for the year ended October 31, 2005. The decrease in our margins is mainly attributable to increases in coffee prices. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased $532,669 or 9.3% to $6,230,932 for the year ended October 31, 2006 from $5,698,263 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 due to increases in selling and administrative expenses and officers salaries partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense. Selling and administrative expenses increased $731,769 or 15% to $5,585,787 for the year ended October 31, 2006 from $4,854,018 for 2005. The increase in selling and administrative expenses reflects several factors, including increases of approximately $485,000 in labor costs $155,000 in professional fees and $234,000 in shipping costs, partially offset by decreases of $60,000 in show and demo costs, $50,000 in advertising and promotion and $40,000 in bank charges. The increase in labor costs is attributable to an increase in administrative and sales staff, salary increases and bonuses. The increase in professional fees was due to the requirements of implementing our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. The increase in shipping costs was attributable to increased sales as well as higher fuel prices which resulted in increased trucking rates. The decrease in show and demo costs represents a change in our sales strategy. The decrease in advertising and promotion is attributable to reduced allowances to customers which resulted in reduced chargebacks. Officers salaries increased $41,807 to $616,052 for the year ended October 31, 2006 from $574,245 for the year ended October 31, 2005. The increase was mainly due to a fiscal year 2006 bonus paid to our President and Chief Executive Officer and was partially offset by a $35,000 reduction in his annual salary effective in August of 2006. Other Income and Expense. Other expense increased $8,011 or 13.3% from $60,321 for the year ended October 31, 2005 to $68,332 for the year ended October 31, 2006. The increase was attributable a loss in the initial year of our Caf La Rica joint venture of $176,911 and an increase in interest expense of $19,417. The increase was partially offset by an increase in interest income of $78,604, a $65,310 increase in other income and $44,403 in management fee income earned from providing administrative services to the Caf La Rica joint venture. We believe the loss by Caf La Rica, which was formed in March 2006, is consistent with the typical initial performance of a start up venture of this type. Income Before Taxes. We had income of $1,295,975 before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2006 compared to income of $1,910,788 before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2005. The decrease was attributable to increased cost of sales due to increased commodity prices and operating expenses, partially offset by increased net sales. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2006 totaled $602,059 compared to $725,653 for the year ended October 31, 2005 as a result of decreased income before taxes. Our effective tax rate remained the same. 23 Year Ended October 31, 2005 (Fiscal 2005) Compared to the Year Ended October 31, 2004 (Fiscal 2004) Net Income. Net income increased $309,793, or 35.4%, to $1,185,135 or $0.25 per share for the year ended October 31, 2005 compared to $875,342 or $0.22 per share for the year ended October 31, 2004. The increase in net income primarily reflects increased net sales, offset in part by an increase in cost of sales. Net Sales. Net sales totaled $41,545,345 for the year ended October 31, 2005, an increase of $13,514,956 or 48.2% from $28,030,389 for the year ended October 31, 2004. The increase in net sales reflects a 20.6% increase in coffee pounds sold from 26.2 million pounds in 2004 to 31.6 million pounds in 2005. The increase in pounds of coffee sold is the result of increased sales of our private label, branded and specialty green coffees. Sales of our Caf Caribe brand, as measured by Information Resources Incorporated data, increased approximately 21.0% over fiscal 2004 due in part to the efforts of our third party marketing specialists through label redesigns and new distribution. The number of our customers in the specialty green coffee area grew approximately 7.3% to 281 customers. These customers are predominately independent gourmet/specialty roasters, some of whom own their own retail outlets. Sales to new customers in this area historically start slowly because many of these companies are start up ventures. Because the specialty green coffee area is the fastest growing segment of the coffee market, we believe that our customer base and sales will grow in this area. The increase in the price of the underlying commodity (coffee) also contributed to the increase in net sales. Cost of Sales. Cost of sales for the year ended October 31, 2005 was $33,875,973 or 81.5% of net sales, as compared to $20,927,506 or 74.7% of net sales for the year ended October 31, 2004. Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity. The increase in cost of sales reflects increased purchases of green coffee in the amount of approximately $12.5 million due to increased pounds sold and higher green coffee prices during the period as prices increased $0.23 per pound year to year, an increase in packaging costs associated with the increase in net sales of approximately $1.0 million, and a decrease in net gains on future contracts. As the price of coffee is cyclical and volatile and subject to many factors, including weather, politics and economics, we are unable to predict the purchase price of green coffee for fiscal 2006. We began to acquire futures contracts with longer terms (generally three to four months) primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices beginning in the latter half of fiscal 2000 and continuing through fiscal 2005. The use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices, to increase our margins as coffee prices have increased and to be more competitive with our pricing. Gross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended October 31, 2005 was $7,669,372, an increase of $566,489 or 8.0%, from $7,102,883 for the year ended October 31, 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 6.8% to 18.5% for the year ended October 31, 2005 from 25.3% for the year ended October 31, 2004. The decrease in our margins is mainly attributable to decreased net gains on future contracts during fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and increases in coffee prices. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased $297,881 or 5.5% to $5,698,263 for the year ended October 31, 2005 from $5,400,382 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 due to increases in selling and administrative expenses and bad debt expense, partially offset by decreased officers salaries. Selling and administrative expenses increased $107,123 or 2.3% to $4,854,018 for the year ended October 31, 2005 from $4,746,895 for 2004. The increase in selling and administrative expenses reflects several factors, including increases of approximately $194,000 in insurance and $162,000 in shipping costs, partially offset by decreases of $167,000 in office salaries and $83,000 in payroll taxes. 24 The increase in insurance was due to the purchase of directors and officers insurance following our initial public offering. The increase in shipping costs was attributable to increased sales. The decrease in office salaries and payroll was due to the departure of our Chief Financial Officer and other administrative staff. Our President and Chief Executive Officer has since assumed the duties previously associated with our Chief Financial Officer. Officers salaries decreased $48,328 to $574,245 for the year ended October 31, 2005 from $622,573 for the year ended October 31, 2004. The decrease was mainly due to our President and Chief Executive Officers decision not to accept a bonus for 2005. Other Income and Expense. Other expense decreased $73,643 or 55.0% from $133,964 for the year ended October 31, 2004 to $60,321 for the year ended October 31, 2005. The decrease was attributable to both an increase in interest income of $38,397 and a decrease in interest expense of $35,246. Income Before Taxes. We had income of $1,910,788 before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2005 compared to income of $1,568,537 before income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increased income from operations and decreased other expense. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2005 totaled $725,653 compared to $693,195 for the year ended October 31, 2004 as a result of increased income before taxes. There was a slight change in the effective rate due to income tax refunds. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of October 31, 2006, we had working capital of $8,357,022 which represented an $83,073 increase from our working capital of $8,273,849 as of October 31, 2005, and total stockholders equity of $11,341,704, which increased by $700,082 from our total stockholders equity of $10,641,622 as of October 31, 2005. Our working capital increased primarily due to an decrease of $1,597,035 in inventories, an increase of $1,336,095 in the commodities held at broker and an increase in our accounts receivable of $1,375,272. Obligations under our line of credit borrowings increased by $1,479,714. At October 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on our line of credit was $2,542,881 compared to $1,063,167 at October 31, 2005. Total stockholders equity increased due to our net income for the fiscal year. As of October 31, 2006, we had a financing agreement with Merrill Lynch Business Financial Services Inc. This line of credit is for a maximum $4,000,000, expires on October 31, 2007 and requires monthly interest payments at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.15%. This loan is secured by a blanket lien on all of our assets. The credit facility contains covenants that place restrictions on our operations. Among other things, these covenants: require us to maintain certain financial ratios; require us to maintain a minimum net worth; and prohibit us from merging with or into other companies, acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of other companies, or selling all or substantially all of our assets without the consent of the lender. These restrictions could adversely impact our ability to implement our business plan, or raise additional capital, if needed. In addition, if we default under our existing credit facility or if our lender demands payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments. As of October 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility. 25 We also leased machinery and equipment under a capital lease which expired in July 2006. The interest rate on the capital lease was 7.347% per annum. The outstanding balance was paid in full during the year. For the year ended October 31, 2006 compared to 2005 our operating activities used net cash of $319,564 as compared to the year ended October 31, 2005 when net cash used by operating activities was $3,879,082. The increased cash flow from operations for the year ended October 31, 2006 was primarily due to a decrease of $1,597,035 in inventories and also, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $397,112 and less of an increase in commodities held at broker of $1,336,095. For the year ended October 31, 2006, our investing activities used net cash of $776,458 as compared to the year October 31, 2005 when net cash used by investing activities was $474,147. The increase in net cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2006 was due to the investments in our joint ventures, partially offset by decreased purchases of property and equipment. The change in cash flow from financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2006 was primarily due to net proceeds from our May 2005 initial public offering of $6,436,016. For the year ended October 31, 2005, our operating activities used net cash of $3,879,082 as compared to the year ended October 31, 2004 when net cash provided by operating activities was $1,616,465. The decreased cash flow from operations for the year ended October 31, 2005 was primarily due to an increase of $2,238,389 in inventories, an increase of $2,120,493 in the commodities held at broker and an increase of $1,423,821 in accounts receivable. For the year ended October 31, 2005, our investing activities used net cash of $474,147 as compared to the year October 31, 2004 when net cash used by investing activities was $1,056,179. The decrease in net cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2005 was due to decreased purchases of property and equipment as the purchase of property and equipment from Premier Roasters occurred in February 2004. For the year ended October 31, 2005, our financing activities provided net cash of $4,446,552 as compared to the year ended October 31, 2004 when net cash provided by financing activities was $8,027. The increased cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from our May 2005 initial public offering of $6,436,016, offset in part by increased net cash payments under our line of credit. Net cash used on our line of credit increased $2,014,857 to net cash used of $1,621,878 for the year ended October 31, 2005 compared to net cash provided of $392,979 for the year ended October 31, 2004. In addition, during fiscal 2005, we used $252,000 to fully pay off a term loan we no longer utilize We expect to fund our operations, including paying our liabilities, funding capital expenditures and making required payments on our debts, through October 31, 2007 with cash provided by operating activities and the use of our credit facility. In addition, an increase in eligible accounts receivable and inventory would permit us to make additional borrowings under our line of credit. We also believe we could, if necessary, obtain additional loans by mortgaging our headquarters. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 26 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices as further described below. Interest Rate Risks. We are subject to market risk from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. At October 31, 2006, our debt consisted of $2,542,881 of variable rate debt under our revolving line of credit. At October 31, 2006, interest on the variable rate debt was payable primarily at 7.47% (or 2.15% above the one month LIBOR rate) for the revolving line of credit. Commodity Price Risks. The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control. Historically, we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices, as further explained in Note 2 of the notes to financial statements in this report. In addition, during the latter half of fiscal 2000, we began to acquire futures contracts with longer terms (generally three to four months) primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee. The use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices although we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time and remain at higher levels, preventing us from obtaining inventory at favorable prices. We generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers, thereby maintaining our gross profits. However, we cannot predict whether we will be able to pass inventory price increases through to our customers in the future. We believe our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales, but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while minimizing margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices. At October 31, 2006, we held 70 options (generally with terms of two months or less) covering an aggregate of 2,625,000 pounds of green coffee beans at prices of $1.05 per pound. The fair market value of these options, which was obtained from major financial institutions, was $116,813 at October 31, 2006. At October 31, 2006, we held 129 future contracts for the purchase of 2,465,000 pounds of coffee at an average price of $1.05 per pound. The market price of coffee applicable to such contracts was $1.05 per pound at October 31, 2006.
