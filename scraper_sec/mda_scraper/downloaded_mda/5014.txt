ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006 may include certain forward looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including (without limitation) statements with respect to anticipated future operating and financial performance, growth and acquisition opportunities and other similar forecasts and statements of expectation. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, and should and variations of these words and similar expressions, are intended to identify these forward looking statements. Forward looking statements made by the Company and its management are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information or otherwise. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In addition, certain factors, including risk factors identified in Item 1A Risk Factors of this document, may affect the Companys businesses. As a result, past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance. 15 Table of Contents Executive Overview The Company operates its largest businesses in three segments: Railcar, Metals Distribution, and Intermodal Tank Container Leasing. Railcar The primary business activity of the Railcar segment is full service leasing of railway tank cars in North America. Key characteristics of the Railcar leasing business are: (a) consistent and predictable cash flows, (b) a strong and creditworthy customer base, (c) multi year leases that tend to bridge the Company over cyclical downturns, (d) long lived revenue earning assets, and (e) diversification across railway tank car types, customers within the industrial sectors served, and geographically across North America. The major challenges in the business are: (a) competition from several strong and experienced competitors and (b) continuing to provide the level of consistent, high quality product and value added service necessary to distinguish the Companys products and services from those of its competitors. The key indicators of performance are revenue growth, lease fleet growth, lease fleet utilization, and profitability. The most significant opportunities in the business are: (a) general growth in the economy, which relies on the bulk movement of chemicals, petrochemicals, foods and other liquid and gas products and (b) displacing railway tank cars owned or net leased by shippers with equipment provided through full service leases. Significant external factors that contribute to the long term financial performance of full service railway tank car lessors are inflation and interest rates. New railcar lease rental rates, which are largely determined by equipment cost, operating costs, interest rates, and competitive factors, influence lease rental rates (upon renewal or leasing to a different customer) on the existing lease fleet. The Company also manufactures tank cars, primarily for its own fleet. Increased prices and reduced availability of steel and other metals are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys activities. The Companys exposure is mitigated via a combination of purchase agreements, the ability to increase prices, and the discretionary nature of railcar construction. Metals Distribution Subsidiaries comprising the Metals Distribution segment are leading distributors of carbon steel, stainless steel and aluminum tubular products; chrome and stainless bar; other carbon steel products, including beams and channels; and aircraft grade tubing and sheets, rolled form shapes and other raw materials. Key characteristics of the Metals Distribution business are: (a) niche, specialty, or value added products relative to more generic steel distribution businesses and (b) diversification across customers within the industrial sectors served, and geographically across the U.S. The major challenges in the business are: (a) competition from strong and experienced competitors, (b) providing the optimal level and mix of product inventory in the right locations, and (c) continuing to provide the level of consistent, high quality product and value added service necessary to distinguish the Companys products and services from those of its competitors. 16 Table of Contents The key indicators of performance are revenue growth and profit margins. The most significant opportunities in the business are: (a) general growth in the manufacturing sector of the economy, (b) increasing business with existing customers, (c) increasing market share by delivering a high level of value added services at competitive prices, and (d) aquisitions. Significant external factors that contribute to the long term financial performance of metal distributors are the level of manufacturing in U.S. and reliable sources of an adequate supply of metals at reasonable costs. Increased prices of steel and other metals are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys activities as the Company is generally able to pass on price increases to its customers. Occasional reduced availability of metals is not expected to have a material impact because the Company, as a major purchaser of metals, is able to negotiate reasonable and adequate supply arrangements. Intermodal Tank Container Leasing The Intermodal Tank Container Leasing segment is a full service lessor of intermodal tank containers to a worldwide customer base. Key characteristics of this business are: (a) consistent and predictable cash flows, (b) a strong and creditworthy customer base, (c) multi year leases and or renewal patterns that tend to bridge the business over cyclical downturns, (d) long lived revenue earning assets, and (e) diversification across intermodal tank container types, customers within the markets served, and geographically around the industrialized world. The major challenges in the business are: (a) competition from strong and experienced competitors and (b) continuing to provide the level of consistent, high quality product and value added service necessary to distinguish the Companys products and services from those of its competitors. The key indicators of performance are revenue growth, lease fleet growth, lease fleet utilization, and profitability. The most significant opportunities in the business are: (a) general growth in the worldwide economy and in world trade, which relies on the bulk movement of chemicals, foods and other liquid and gas products and (b) displacing competitive modes of transport for these products, such as barrels and parcel tanker ships. Significant external factors that contribute to the long term financial performance of full service intermodal tank container lessors are inflation and interest rates. New intermodal tank container lease rental rates, which are largely determined by equipment cost, operating costs and interest rates, influence lease rental rates (upon renewal or leasing to a different customer) on the existing lease fleet. 17 Table of Contents 2006 versus 2005 Results of Operations Performance of the equipment leasing businesses improved in all major markets. Demand for railcar equipment and leased intermodal tank containers remained strong, resulting in fleet growth, improved lease rental rates, and continued high fleet utilization. Revenues and gross profit from services were as follows: 2006 2005 Increase (Dollars in Thousands) Services revenue $ 820,236 $ 767,590 $ 52,646 Cost of services 451,542 448,776 2,766 Gross profit from services $ 368,694 $ 318,814 $ 49,880 Gross profit % 45 % 42 % Services revenue in 2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to a $36.3 million increase in railcar leasing and service revenues (equipment additions and higher lease rates), a $9.1 million increase in intermodal tank container leasing revenues (equipment additions, improved utilization rate and higher lease rates), and $7.2 million higher revenue in the contract rail switching business (higher volume). Gross profit on services revenue in 2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to a $39.5 million increase for railcar leasing (increased gains on disposals, equipment additions and higher lease rates more than offsetting higher maintenance expense), a $8.8 million increase for the intermodal tank container leasing business (equipment additions, higher utilization rate and higher lease rates), and a $1.8 million increase for the contract rail switching business (higher volume). Gains on disposals, primarily on rail cars and tank containers, totaled $21.2 million in 2006 compared with $10.4 million in 2005, and are treated as a reduction to the cost of services. The improvement in gross margin on services revenue from 42% to 45% was primarily due to margin improvement in the railcar leasing and intermodal tank container leasing businesses. Average fleet utilization of the Companys railcar fleet was 99% for 2006 and 2005. Utilization rates of the Companys existing railcars are driven by long term requirements of manufacturers and shippers of chemical products, petroleum products, food products, and bulk plastics, and suitability of the Companys fleet to meet such demand. The potential impact of short term fluctuations in demand is tempered by the longer term nature of the leases. Over the past five years, the average term of leases entered into for newly manufactured railcars was approximately seven years, and the average term of leases entered into for used railcars was approximately four years. The average term of leases entered into during 2006 was consistent with the past five years. 18 Table of Contents Demand increased for products of the metals distribution business and for railcars, with margin improvement driven by higher metals distribution volume and prices. Revenues and gross profit from sales were as follows: 2006 2005 Increase (Dollars in Thousands) Sales revenue $ 1,051,526 $ 894,081 $ 157,445 Cost of sales 883,056 744,366 138,690 Gross profit from sales $ 168,470 $ 149,715 $ 18,755 Gross profit % 16 % 17 % Sales revenue for 2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to $90.2 million higher sales of metals distribution products (higher volume and prices), a $31.1 million increase in sales of sulphur processing equipment (completion of a large project), $27.5 million increased sales of manufactured railcars (higher volume and prices), $6.4 million higher sales of mobile railcar moving equipment (higher volume), $4.0 million higher sales of gear drives (higher volume) and $2.3 million higher sales of light rail transit products (higher volume). These increases were partially offset by $4.7 million lower sales of sulphur based fertilizer (business sold in April 2005). Gross profit on sales revenue in 2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to a $13.8 million increase for metals distribution products (higher volume and prices more than offsetting higher cost of sales), a $4.1 million increase in sulphur processing equipment (completion of a large project), a $1.3 million increase for light rail transit products (higher volume) and a $1.2 million increase for mobile railcar moving equipment (higher volume). These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease for containment vessel heads (higher material costs) and a $0.6 million decrease for manufactured railcars (higher material costs offsetting higher volume and higher prices). The decline in gross margin on sales revenues from 17% to 16% was primarily due to the increase in sales of the sulphur processing equipment which had a lower margin than the overall gross margin on sales revenue. General and administrative expenses in 2006 were $2.7 million lower than in 2005 primarily due to $4.5 million lower expenses in the railcar business (primarily higher product liability expense in 2005), and $1.0 million lower expenses in the sulphur based fertilizer business (sold in April 2005) partially offset by $1.5 million higher expense in the metals distribution business (higher selling expense due to higher volume) and $1.0 million higher expense in the sulphur processing business (increased volume). Interest expense in 2006 was $7.9 million higher than in 2005 due to interest on advances from parent and affiliates and the full year of interest expense related to a new financing in 2005 more than offsetting lower interest expense from principal repayments of debt and capitalized interest of $3.8 million in 2006. Interest rates and debt are discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for income taxes was $114.6 million in 2006 with an effective tax rate of 35.8%, compared with $56.4 million in 2005 with an effective tax rate of 21.4%. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 was the result of settling federal tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. Income taxes are discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 19 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity The funds advanced from parent and affiliates, net cash provided by operating activities, and funds from the liquidation of short term investments and available for sale securities were used to finance additions to the lease fleet and other fixed assets, pay dividends to the Companys stockholder, and service debt obligations. It is the Companys policy to pay to Holdings a quarterly dividend of approximately 70% of net income. To the extent that the Company generates cash in excess of its operating needs, such funds, in excess of the amounts paid as dividends, are advanced to Holdings. Conversely, when the Company requires additional funds to support its operations and capital expenditures, required amounts are provided by Holdings. Funds advanced to or from Holdings bear interest at commercial rates. No restrictions exist regarding the amount of dividends which may be paid or advances which may be made by the Company to Holdings. Cash flows from operating activities: Operating activities provided $327.4 million of net cash in 2006, compared with $338.2 million provided in 2005. The net cash provided by operating activities was lower in 2006 primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher depreciation and deferred taxes (see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash flows from investing activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $554.3 million in 2006 compared with $419.3 million used in investing activities in 2005. The change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher capital spending for construction and the purchase of lease fleet. During 2006, the Company invested $711.5 million in the construction and purchase of lease fleet assets, compared with $510.7 million in 2005. The 2006 capital expenditures included $229.3 million to exercise purchase options for railcars related to sale leaseback transactions (compared with $76.0 million in 2005). Of the $229.3 million for the railcars related to the sale leaseback transactions, $63.9 million was paid in the first quarter of 2006, $25.0 million was paid in the second quarter of 2006, $108.1 million was paid in the third quarter of 2006 and the remaining $32.3 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2006. Since capital expenditures for railcars are generally incurred subsequent to receipt of firm customer lease orders, such expenditures are discretionary to the Company based on its desire to accept those lease orders. Capital expenditures for intermodal tank containers are likewise discretionary in the intermodal tank container business. During 2006, the Company invested $57.4 million in the construction and purchase of other fixed assets, compared with $71.2 million in 2005. Capital spending for the construction of a new tank car manufacturing plant in Alexandria, Louisiana from inception through December 31, 2006 totaled $100.8 million, of which $31.6 million has been reimbursed by state and local governments. The Alexandria plant is complete and in operation. Further reimbursement of capital spending by state and local governments is expected to total approximately $0.4 million. 20 Table of Contents During 2006, the Company received a net amount of $178.7 million from the sales in excess of purchases of available for sale securities and short term investments. During 2005, the Company expended a net amount of $21.8 million for purchases in excess of sales of available for sale securities and short term investments. The available for sale securities are investment grade debt obligations with a combined weighted average maturity under two years. The short term investments consist of commercial paper with original maturities between four and six months. These investments are available for the Companys use to fund repayment of principal obligations, finance lease fleet additions (including the exercise of sale leaseback purchase options), or fund other operating needs. Proceeds from disposals of lease fleet and other fixed assets were $37.6 million in 2006 compared with $22.0 million in 2005. Cash flows from financing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities was $242.9 million in 2006 compared with $131.5 million in 2005. The change in net cash from financing activities was primarily due to the increased advances from parent and affiliates in 2006. During 2006, the Companys financing activities included principal repayments on debt totaling $85.1 million compared with $40.6 million in 2005. Cash dividends to Holdings were $137.0 million in 2006 compared with $140.0 million in 2005. Management expects future cash provided from operating activities, long term financings, available for sale securities, and advances from parent and affiliates will be adequate to provide for the continued investment in the Companys business and enable it to meet its debt service obligations. Approximately 11% of Company owned railcars are pledged to secure equipment obligations and secured notes. The remaining Company owned railcars are free of liens. The following table presents the scheduled cash inflows and outflows for the railcar leasing business over the next five years based on leases and railcar related indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Railcar Leasing Cash Inflows Minimum future lease rentals $ 479.6 $ 383.7 $ 296.5 $ 213.9 $ 127.8 Railcar Leasing Cash Outflows Minimum future lease payments 42.4 40.1 37.2 39.6 42.6 Principal and interest amount of obligations 271.8 150.7 238.5 198.8 92.7 Excess (deficit) of inflows over outflows $ 165.4 $ 192.9 $ 20.8 $ (24.5 ) $ (7.5 ) Minimum future lease rentals above relate to railcar leases in effect at December 31, 2006. Based upon its historical experience, the Company expects that the railcars (other than those which are retired in the ordinary course of business) will be re leased at the expiration of such leases. The rentals under such future leases cannot be ascertained and are not reflected above. 21 Table of Contents In addition, maturities of debt obligations and interest payments for the intermodal tank container leasing business over the next five years are as follows (dollars in millions): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 $22.6 $ 22.5 $ 21.4 $ 17.2 $ 15.3 The Company has not experienced any significant impact from general inflation on its financial position or results of operations over the last several years. The Companys foreign subsidiaries periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against currency exchange rate exposures. There were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2006, contractual obligations of the Company are as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 year 1 3years 3 5years More than5 years (Dollars in Millions) Long term debt obligations (inclusive of interest) $ 1,753.6 $ 294.6 $ 433.5 $ 324.5 $ 701.0 Operating leases 363.5 45.4 82.1 84.4 151.6 Purchase obligations 29.7 27.6 2.1 Total contractual obligations $ 2,146.8 $ 367.6 $ 517.7 $ 408.9 $ 852.6 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company currently has no off balance sheet arrangements that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see Summary of Accounting Principles and Practices more fully described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity. 22 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue from sales of products is generally recognized upon shipment to customers which is when title and the risks and rewards of ownership are passed on to the customers. Such revenue is based upon determinable sales prices and is recognized only upon collectibility being reasonably assured. Certain long term contracts are accounted for under the completed contract method when the Company is unable to reasonably forecast costs and the time required to complete those contracts. Lessor Accounting Most of the Companys railcar and intermodal tank container leases are classified as operating leases. Aggregate rentals from operating leases are reported as revenue ratably over the life of the lease as collectibility is reasonably assured. Expenses, including depreciation and maintenance, are charged as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses are borne by Holdings. Income Taxes The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. Available for Sale Securities Available for sale securities consist of investment grade corporate debt securities and U.S. government obligations. Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company carries its accounts receivable at their face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable as well as establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances and credit conditions and based on a history of write offs and collections. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms. Uncollectible receivables are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when approved by management after all collection efforts have been exhausted. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, using the first in, first out (FIFO) or last in, first out (LIFO) methods. 23 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. Asset Impairment In assessing recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The statement is effective in 2008 for the Company. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This statement requires the recognition of overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit plans as an asset or liability and the recognition of changes in the funded status through comprehensive income. This statement also requires the measurement of funded status as of the Companys year end. This statement is effective in 2007 for the Company, with disclosure of the impact in fiscal years beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The requirement to use the Companys year end, rather than the September 30 measurement date currently used, as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective in 2008 for the Company. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction (FSP 13 2). FSP 13 2 addresses how a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease. FSP 13 2 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2007, with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of FSP 13 2 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 24 Table of Contents In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes including defining the criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in financial statements and provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This interpretation is effective in 2007 for the Company, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to January 1, 2007 retained earnings. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this interpretation on its consolidated financial statements. 2005 versus 2004 Results of Operations Performance of the equipment leasing businesses improved in all major markets. Demand for existing railcar equipment improved, resulting in fleet growth, higher fleet utilization and improved lease rental rates. Demand for leased intermodal tank containers improved, resulting in fleet growth and higher utilization. Revenues and gross profit from services were as follows: 2005 2004 Increase(Decrease) (Dollars in Thousands) Services revenue $ 767,590 $ 747,915 $ 19,675 Cost of services 448,776 465,219 (16,443 ) Gross profit from services $ 318,814 $ 282,696 $ 36,118 Gross profit % 42 % 38 % Services revenue in 2005 increased from 2004 primarily due to a $41.0 million increase in railcar leasing and service revenues (improved utilization rates and equipment additions), a $7.3 million increase in intermodal tank container leasing revenues (improved utilization rates and equipment additions), and $3.6 million higher revenue in the contract rail switching business, which more than offset a $30.4 million decrease in revenues from eliminating low margin transportation and terminaling activity related to sulphur processing. Gross profit on services revenue in 2005 increased from 2004 primarily due to a $25.4 million improvement for railcar leasing (improved utilization rates, lower external lease expense due to exercising purchase options on certain leases and equipment additions), a $9.2 million increase for the intermodal tank container leasing business (improved utilization rates and equipment additions) and a $1.0 million increase for contract rail switching (higher volume and improved margins). Average fleet utilization of the Companys railcar fleet was 99% for 2005, compared with 96% for 2004. Utilization rates of the Companys existing railcars are driven by long term requirements of manufacturers and shippers of chemical products, petroleum products, food products, and bulk plastics, and suitability of the Companys fleet to meet such demand. The potential impact of short term fluctuations in demand is tempered by the longer term nature of the leases. Over the past five years, the average term of leases entered into for newly manufactured railcars was approximately seven years, and the average term of leases entered into for used railcars was approximately four years. The average term of leases entered into during 2005 was consistent with the past five years. 25 Table of Contents Sales revenue increased primarily due to increased demand for products of the metals distribution business. Revenues and gross profit from sales were as follows: 2005 2004 Increase (Dollars in Thousands) Sales revenue $ 894,081 $ 778,371 $ 115,710 Cost of sales 744,366 642,813 101,553 Gross profit from sales $ 149,715 $ 135,558 $ 14,157 Gross profit % 17 % 17 % Sales revenue for 2005 increased from 2004 primarily due to $116.7 million higher sales of metals distribution products (higher prices and volume), $20.0 million increased sales of manufactured railcars (higher volume and prices), $7.5 million higher sales of containment vessel heads (higher volume and prices), $5.4 million higher sales of mobile railcar moving vehicles (higher volume), and $4.6 million higher sales of light rail transit components, more than offsetting $18.0 million lower sales of fasteners (transferred to an affiliate of Holdings in December, 2004), $10.8 million lower sales of sulphur based fertilizer (certain assets of the business sold in April, 2005), and $8.5 million lower sales of sulphur processing equipment (timing of project completion). Gross profit on sales in 2005 increased from 2004 primarily due to a $34.1 million increase for metals distribution products (higher prices partially offset by higher costs), a $1.9 million increase for containment vessel heads (higher volume and prices), a $1.5 million increase for mobile railcar moving vehicles, and a $1.3 million increase for light rail transit components. These increases were partially offset by a $12.4 million decrease for manufactured railcars (primarily caused by higher material prices), a $4.4 million decrease for fasteners (transferred to an affiliate of Holdings in December, 2004), a $4.1 million decrease for sulphur processing equipment (timing of project completion), and a $3.4 million decrease for sulphur based fertilizer (certain assets of the business sold in April, 2005). General and administrative expenses in 2005 were $2.2 million higher than 2004 due to higher costs in the railcar and intermodal tank container leasing businesses, partially offset by reductions due to the transfer of the fastener business to an affiliate of Holdings in December, 2004 and the sale of certain assets related to the sulphur based fertilizer business in April, 2005. Interest expense in 2005 was $12.9 million higher than 2004 due to the interest expense related to new financing in 2004 and 2005 more than offsetting lower interest expense from principal repayments of debt. Interest rates and debt are discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest income in 2005 was $4.9 million higher than 2004 due to higher average balances of available for sale securities. Other income, net of expenses, in 2005 was $6.4 million lower than in 2004 due to $6.2 million of income in 2004 from the receipt and disposal of certain financial assets related to settlement of a bankruptcy claim against Air Canada and a gain of $3.0 million in 2004 on the sale of an unused parcel of land. Provision for income taxes was $56.4 million in 2005 with an effective tax rate of 21.4%, compared with $81.8 million in 2004 with an effective tax rate of 35.5%. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 is the result of settling federal tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. Income taxes are discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Operating activities provided $338.2 million of net cash in 2005, compared with $285.9 million in 2004. The net cash provided by operating activities was higher in 2005 primarily due to higher net income and a smaller increase in working capital, partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred taxes. The net cash provided by operating activities, along with proceeds from the issuance of debt and collection of funds previously advanced to parent, were used to finance additions to the lease fleet and other fixed assets, pay dividends to the Companys stockholder, service debt obligations, and invest in available for sale securities and short term investments. During 2005, the Company reduced its investment in available for sale securities by $11.7 million. The securities are investment grade debt obligations with a combined weighted average maturity under two years. The investments are available for the Companys use to fund repayment of principal obligations, finance lease fleet additions (including the exercise of sale leaseback purchase options), or fund other operating needs. During 2005, the Company invested $581.9 million in the construction and purchase of lease fleet and other fixed assets, compared with $331.4 million in 2004. The increase in capital expenditures was due to increased demand from leasing customers for new railway tank cars and intermodal tank containers, a $76.0 million expenditure to exercise purchase options for railcars related to sale leaseback transactions, and investment in railcar manufacturing assets. Of the capital expenditures for construction and purchase of lease fleet and other fixed assets over the past five years, approximately 76% have been for railcars. Since capital expenditures for railcars are generally incurred subsequent to receipt of firm customer lease orders, such expenditures are discretionary to the Company based on its desire to accept those lease orders. Capital expenditures for intermodal tank containers are likewise discretionary in the intermodal tank container business. Capital spending as of the end of 2005 for the construction of a new tank car manufacturing plant in Alexandria, Louisiana totaled $49.7 million, of which $16.2 million has been reimbursed by state and local governments. Proceeds from disposals of lease fleet and other fixed assets were $22.0 million in 2005 compared with $31.1 million in 2004. The lower proceeds in 2005 were due to fewer railcars sold partially offset by higher prices obtained for railcars sold for scrap. Net cash used in investing activities was $419.3 million in 2005 compared with $370.2 million used in 2004. During 2005, the Companys financing activities included a $311.0 million issuance of unsecured Senior Notes and a $1.1 million capital lease obligation, for a total of $312.1 million in debt proceeds, compared with $300.0 million of debt issued in 2004. Principal repayments on debt totaled $40.6 million compared with $78.4 million in 2004. Cash dividends were $140.0 million in 2005 compared with $99.0 million in 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities was $131.5 million in 2005 compared with $122.6 million in 2004. 27 Table of Contents On September 28, 2005, the Company exercised options to purchase 2,424 railcars that the Company has leased since 1994 and 1995 as part of certain sale leaseback transactions. The aggregate purchase price paid by the Company for these railcars was approximately $113.9 million, of which $63.9 million was paid on January 2, 2006 and the remaining $50.0 million is payable in four installments ending in December 2006. The Companys purchase of these railcars was consummated on January 2, 2006, at which time the purchased railcars ceased to be subject to the operating leases. It is the Companys policy to pay to its parent a quarterly dividend of approximately 70% of net income. To the extent that the Company generates cash in excess of its operating needs, such funds, in excess of the amounts paid as dividends, are advanced to its parent. Conversely, when the Company requires additional funds to support its operations, prior advances are repaid by or advanced from its parent. Funds advanced to or from its parent bear interest at commercial rates. No restrictions exist regarding the amount of dividends which may be paid or advances which may be made by the Company to its parent. ITEM 7A.
