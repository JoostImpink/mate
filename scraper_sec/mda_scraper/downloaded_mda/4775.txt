Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Background Since we commenced operations in 1995, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the identification, development and commercialization of novel therapies that improve neurological function in people with MS, SCI and other disorders of the CNS. Our marketed drug, Zanaflex Capsules, is FDA approved for the management of spasticity. We announced positive results from a Phase 3 clinical trial of our lead product candidate, Fampridine SR, for the improvement of walking ability in people with MS in September 2006, and we plan to initiate an additional Phase 3 clinical trial of Fampridine SR in people with MS in the second quarter of 2007. Our preclinical programs also target MS and SCI, as well as other CNS disorders, including stroke and traumatic brain injury. From 1995 until mid 2004, we were engaged almost exclusively in the in licensing of compounds and the preclinical and clinical development of these compounds. We licensed the rights to Fampridine SR from Elan for the treatment of SCI in 1997. In September 2003, we entered into an amended license agreement with Elan that granted us exclusive worldwide rights to Fampridine SR in return for the payment of royalties and milestones. In addition, we entered into a supply agreement under which Elan provides Fampridine SR based upon an agreed upon price schedule. We have expended a significant portion of our funds on a number of clinical trials for Fampridine SR, our most advanced product candidate, including two Phase 3 clinical trials of Fampridine SR in SCI and a Phase 2 and a Phase 3 clinical trial in MS, the results of which were announced in April 2004 and September 2006, respectively. In September 2006 we announced positive results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of our lead product candidate, Fampridine SR in MS. Statistical significance was achieved on all three efficacy criteria defined by the FDA in the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). We plan to initiate a second Phase 3 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2007. An earlier Phase 2 clinical trial in MS was completed in 2001. In mid 2004, we decided to put our clinical trials of Fampridine SR in SCI on hold, and refocused our efforts on our ongoing Fampridine SR in MS program, leading to our recently completed Phase 3 clinical trial of Fampridine SR for improvement of walking ability in people with MS. We may resume our clinical development of Fampridine SR for SCI in the future. In July 2004, we acquired all of Elans research, development, distribution, sales and marketing rights to Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets in the United States. These products are FDA approved for the management of spasticity. We made an upfront payment to Elan of $2.0 million and are obligated to pay royalties on sales and to make milestone payments upon achievement of specified sales levels. To date, we have achieved three milestones, the first triggering a payment of $1.5 million, 50% of which was paid in the first quarter of 2005 and 50% of which was paid in the first quarter of 2006. The second milestone of $3.0 million was paid in March 2006. The third milestone of $5.0 million was paid in February 2007. As part of our Zanaflex acquisition, we entered into a long term supply agreement with Elan under which Elan provides us with Zanaflex Capsules. Elan also assigned us its rights under an agreement with Novartis for the supply of tizanidine and Zanaflex tablets. Our marketing efforts are focused on Zanaflex Capsules, which we launched in April 2005. Zanaflex tablets lost compound patent protection in 2002 and both Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets compete with 12 generic tizanidine products. Although we currently distribute Zanaflex tablets, we do not, and do not intend to, actively promote Zanaflex tablets. As a result, prescriptions for Zanaflex tablets have declined and we expect that they will continue to decline. Our goal is to convert 61 as many sales of Zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets to sales of Zanaflex Capsules as possible. We believe that sales of Zanaflex Capsules will constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. In late 2004, we began establishing our own specialty sales force in the United States, which consisted of 50 sales professionals as of December 31, 2006 and was expanded to 65 sales professionals by the first quarter of 2007. This sales force has targeted neurologists and other prescribers who specialize in treating people with conditions that involve spasticity. Members of this sales force also call on managed care organizations, pharmacists and distribution customers. In August 2005, we entered into an agreement with Cardinal Health, under which it had provided approximately 160 sales representatives to market Zanaflex Capsules, on a non exclusive basis, to primary care physicians in the United States. Sales in the primary care market did not reach the targets specified in our agreement. We terminated the agreement with Cardinal Health and made a payment of $125,000 in connection with that termination during the third quarter of 2006. In May 2005, we retained Access Worldwide Communications, Inc. (Access) to provide a small, dedicated sales force of pharmaceutical telesales professionals to contact primary care, specialty physicians and pharmacists. In February 2006, we expanded the scope of the arrangement with Access and transferred some of the primary care physician contacts previously covered by Cardinal Health to Access. Our contract with Access is now serviced by TMS Professional Markets Group, LLC, which purchased various telesales assets from Access in 2006. In addition, we initiated a pilot program with Innovex Inc. that provided six part time representatives making exclusive calls promoting Zanaflex Capsules to primary care physicians, focusing on some of the contacts previously covered by Cardinal Health. In October 2006, we gave notice to Innovex Inc. of termination of our contract sales force agreement. In December 2005, we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with PRF pursuant to which we assigned PRF the right to receive a portion of our net revenues (as defined in the agreement which definition is different from our net revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP) from Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets and any future Zanaflex products. The agreement covers all such Zanaflex net revenues generated from October 1, 2005 through and including December 31, 2015, unless the agreement is terminated earlier. In consideration for the assignment, PRF paid us $15.0 million at signing. We used approximately $3.0 million of that payment to repay a portion of the amount we owe to GE Capital, $200,000 of that payment for expenses associated with such repayment and $691,000 of that payment to reimburse PRF for expenses it incurred in the transaction. Under our agreement with PRF, we are required to use the remainder of the amount we received at signing and any other amounts we receive under the agreement to support commercialization, sales, marketing, clinical and regulatory activities and other financial obligations related specifically and solely to our Zanaflex operations. If our Zanaflex net revenues in 2005 had equaled or exceeded $11.0 million and our Zanaflex net revenues in the first six months of 2006 had equaled or exceeded $16.0 million, at our election, PRF would also have been required to loan us an additional $5.0 million. We did not meet this milestone. In November 2006, we entered into an amendment to the revenue interests assignment agreement with PRF. Under the amendment, PRF is entitled to a royalty consisting of certain specified percentages of Zanaflex net revenues, based upon the level of net revenues. The amendment provides that the royalty rate will drop to 1% upon PRFs receipt of 2.1 times the aggregate amount PRF has paid us under the agreement, as amended. Previously, once PRF had received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least twice the aggregate amount PRF paid us under the Agreement, the royalty rate would drop to 1% of Zanaflex net revenues. Under the terms of the amendment, PRF paid us $5.0 million in November 2006 and agreed that we would be entitled to an additional $5.0 million is due if our net revenues during the fiscal year 2006 equaled or exceeded $25.0 million. This milestone has been met and the receivable is reflected in our December 31, 2006 financial statements. This milestone payment was received in February 2007. Under the terms of the 62 amendment, we are required to pay PRF $5.0 million on December 1, 2009 and an additional $5.0 million on December 1, 2010. For more information regarding our agreement with PRF, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Arrangements. We completed an initial public offering on February 9, 2006 in which 6,075,614 shares of our common stock were sold, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $31.5 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. Upon the closing of the initial public offering, all of our convertible preferred stock and mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into 13,338,278 shares of common stock. This conversion resulted in the following: (a) recognition of the unamortized portion of a beneficial conversion charge of $48.5 million; (b) recognition of the unamortized portion of issuance costs relating to Series E, Series I, Series J and Series K preferred stock of $271,000; and (c) reversal of accrued preferred dividends on Series J and Series K preferred stock of $12.7 million. We completed a private placement on October 6, 2006 in which 3,230,769 shares of our common stock were sold, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $29.8 million after deducting issuance costs. Product Revenue and Returns Ongoing Zanaflex Capsule and Tablet Sales Product revenue consists of sales of Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets. Under SFAS 48, Revenue Recognition When the Right of Return Exists, we are not permitted to recognize revenue until we can reasonably estimate the likely return rate for our products. Since we have only limited sales history with Zanaflex Capsules and due to generic competition and customer conversion from Zanaflex tablets to Zanaflex Capsules, we cannot reasonably determine a return rate. As a result, we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model. At a future point in time, we expect to be able to reasonably estimate product returns and will then begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors. Under our deferred revenue model, we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our wholesale drug distributors. Instead, we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price, and classify the cost basis of the inventory held by the wholesaler as a component of inventory. We recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to end users because once prescriptions are filled the product cannot be returned. We use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized. When we receive the prescription data, we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales. We then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold. We began receiving end user prescription data in March 2005 which enabled us to begin recognizing revenue from Zanaflex tablet sales. We began marketing Zanaflex Capsules in April 2005 and began receiving prescription data and recognizing revenue in the same month. Under our revenue interests assignment agreement with PRF, as amended in November 2006, PRF is entitled to a portion of our net revenues from Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets and any future Zanaflex products. The agreement covers all Zanaflex net revenues (as defined in the agreement) generated from October 1, 2005 through and including December 31, 2015, unless the agreement terminates earlier. Under the agreement, PRF is entitled to a certain portion of such Zanaflex net revenues. For more information regarding our agreement with PRF, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Arrangements. We accept returns of products for six months prior to and 12 months after their expiration date. Returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue, reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize. 63 Sale of Zanaflex Tablet Inventory Acquired From Elan When we acquired Zanaflex from Elan, we also acquired Elans inventory of Zanaflex tablets. This inventory included partial lots with expiration dating of less than 12 months and full lots with expiration dating greater than 12 months. The majority of this product was sold by us during July 2004 through March 2005. We deferred recognition of any revenue from sales of the partial lot inventory until the return period for the product expired in June 2006 (12 months following product expiration). We could not use prescription data to recognize revenue associated with the partial lot inventory acquired from Elan because we could not determine whether the prescription was filled with product that Elan sold prior to our acquisition of Zanaflex or with product we sold. We received returns of the product sold by Elan through June 2006 at which point the right of return expired and we recognized the remaining $2.2 million deferred revenue balance as gross sales. Returns of Zanaflex Tablets sold by Elan As part of the acquisition of Zanaflex, we agreed to accept returns of Zanaflex tablets that were returned subsequent to January 17, 2005, including returns of product that was originally sold by Elan. Product returns prior to January 17, 2005, were the responsibility of Elan. We recorded a charge of $4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, for the estimated returns of Zanaflex tablets sold by Elan. Our obligation to continue to accept these returns ended in June 2006. As a result of the returns we accepted since 2004, the net balance remaining on this liability was approximately $1.8 million. We reversed this liability in June 2006 which resulted in a reduction in discounts and allowances of $1.8 million and a corresponding reduction of the product return liability on our balance sheet. Discounts and Allowances Reserves for cash discounts, rebates and chargebacks have been established. At the time product is shipped to wholesalers a charge is recorded to discounts and allowances and the appropriate reserves are credited. Allowances are established on a product by product basis. These allowances are established by management as its best estimate of each products historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves. Allowances for chargebacks, rebates and discounts are established based on contractual terms with customers, analyses of historical usage of discount, chargeback and rebate reserves, communications with customers, the level of inventory remaining in the distribution channel, expectations about the market for each product and any anticipated introduction of competitive products. Grant Revenue Grant revenue is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred and our performance obligations under the terms of the respective contract are satisfied. To the extent expended, grant revenue related to the purchase of equipment is deferred and amortized over the shorter of its useful life or the life of the related contract. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of cost of inventory, expense due to inventory reserves, royalty expense, milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the Zanaflex acquisition, packaging costs, freight and required inventory stability testing costs. Our inventory costs, royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into in connection with our Zanaflex acquisition. Any payments we make to PRF in connection with the revenue interests assignment transaction entered into in December 2005 will not constitute royalty expense or otherwise affect our cost of sales. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Arrangements. 64 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, fees paid to professional service providers for independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data from our clinical trials, costs of contract manufacturing services, costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development, depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products, costs of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates and preclinical programs. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Included in this table are our external research and development costs, consisting largely of clinical trial and research services provided by outside laboratories and vendors recognized in connection with each product candidate currently in clinical development and all preclinical programs as a group. Many of our internal research and development costs, including personnel costs, related benefits and stock based compensation, are not attributable to any individual project because we use these resources across several development projects. Compensation expense for option grants is classified between clinical development and preclinical research and development based on employee job function. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Clinical development: Contract expense MS $ 6,004 $ 4,011 $ 2,850 Contract expense SCI 32 5,853 Other contract expense 751 3,960 4,945 Operating expense 1,553 1,300 2,652 Total clinical development 8,308 9,303 16,300 Preclinical research & development: Research contracts 120 115 628 Contract expense 33 79 113 Operating expense 3,057 3,393 4,958 Total preclinical research & development 3,210 3,587 5,699 Regulatory affairs 537 Total $ 12,055 $ 12,890 $ 21,999 Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses include the costs of salaries for our sales and marketing personnel and the cost of our advertising, promotion and education programs. Sales and marketing expenses include the cost of our contract pharmaceutical telesales services provided by Access. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving executive, finance, medical affairs, business development, legal, information technology and human resource functions. Other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development or sales and marketing expense and professional fees for legal, investor relations and accounting services 65 Stock Based Compensation Historically, we accounted for share based compensation costs under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (SFAS No. 123), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which requires that the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on the awards original estimate of fair value. Results for prior periods have not been restated. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we changed from recognizing the effect of forfeitures as they occur to estimating the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recognized forfeitures associated with its share based awards as they occurred rather than estimating forfeitures. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $454,225 during the three month period ended March 31, 2006, calculated as the difference between compensation cost recognized to date using actual forfeitures and the cost that would have been recognized to date using estimated forfeitures. We estimate that our future annual forfeiture rate will be 5%. We account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis in accordance with EITF No. 96 18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services, and FASB Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 15 and 25. Beneficial Conversion Feature In May 2003, we completed a private placement of 112,790,233 shares of Series J convertible preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $55.3 million. As a result of this financing, our Series A through Series I preferred stockholders original conversion prices were reduced due to anti dilution adjustments, which resulted in a beneficial conversion of $80.7 million in accordance with EITF No. 98 5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios and EITF No. 00 27, Application of Issue No. 98 5 to Certain Convertible Instruments. The beneficial conversion of $20.9 million was recorded as an immediate charge to additional paid in capital, relating to our Series A, Series B, Series C, Series F and Series H convertible preferred stock, which were not mandatorily redeemable and could be converted to common stock at any time at the option of the holders. The remaining beneficial conversion of $59.9 million, relating to our Series E and Series I convertible preferred stock, which were mandatorily redeemable at any time on or after June 30, 2008, was being accreted ratably over the mandatory redemption period. Such accretion amounted to $29.1 million, $11.6 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and was charged to additional paid in capital. Upon completion of the Companys initial public offering on February 9, 2006, the remaining beneficial conversion amount was fully accreted. The issuance of Series J mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock resulted in a beneficial conversion amounting to $40.0 million in accordance with EITF No. 98 5. The beneficial 66 conversion was calculated based on the estimated fair value of our common stock price per share at the date of issuance of Series J preferred stock of approximately $10.14 per share of common stock, which was calculated based on the estimated projected midpoint of the range of our initial public offering price per common share, which was planned in the fourth calendar quarter of 2003, and the stock price appreciation in comparable public companies from May 2003 to August 2003. The beneficial conversion feature was being accreted ratably over the mandatory redemption period, with a charge to additional paid in capital of $19.4 million, $7.8 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Upon completion of the Companys initial public offering on February 9, 2006, the remaining beneficial conversion amount was fully accreted. Other Income (Expense) Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Interest expense consists of interest expense related to our revenue interest liability, our GE Capital notes, amortization of debt discount and accrued interest on our convertible notes. Other income consists primarily of New York State tax refunds. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Gross Sales We recognized gross sales from the sale of Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets of $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $20.6 million, or 349.2%. The increase was due to 12 months of Zanaflex Capsule sales in 2006 versus 7 months in 2005 in addition to an increase in Zanaflex Capsule prescriptions primarily attributable to our increased sales force. We recognize product sales using a deferred revenue recognition model meaning that shipments to wholesalers are recorded as deferred revenue and only recognized as revenue when end user prescriptions of the product are reported. Gross sales in the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of Zanaflex tablet revenue recognized based on gross prescription data that we began receiving in March 2005, which is when we began receiving prescription data for tablets containing a code that identified these prescriptions as having been filled with product we sold. We did not recognize revenue from Zanaflex Capsules prescription data until after our launch of the product in April 2005. As part of the Zanaflex acquisition, the Company purchased certain tablet inventory from Elan that expired within one year. The majority of this product was sold by the Company during July 2004 through March 2005. The Company deferred revenue for this product due to the uncertainty of future returns. The Company received returns of the product sold by Elan through June 2006, at which point the right of return expired and the Company recognized the remaining $2.2 million deferred revenue as gross sales. Discounts and Allowances We recorded negative discounts and allowances of $396,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to an expense $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of approximately $1.5 million, or 135.5%. As part of the Zanaflex acquisition in 2004, we agreed to accept any returns of Zanaflex tablets that were returned subsequent to January 17, 2005, including returns of product that was originally sold by Elan. Product returns prior to that date were the responsibility of Elan. As a result of this agreement, in December 2004 we recorded a return liability of $4.1 million which was our best estimate of the Zanaflex tablet returns for which we could potentially become liable. Our obligation to continue to accept these returns ended in June 2006. As a result of the returns we accepted since 2004, the net balance remaining on this liability was approximately $1.8 million in June 2006. We reversed this liability in June 2006, which resulted in a reduction in discounts 67 and allowances of $1.8 million and a corresponding reduction of the product return liability on our balance sheet. Discounts and allowances are recorded when Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets are shipped to wholesalers. Discounts and allowances for the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of a negative $1.8 million due to the Elan product return liability reversal described above, $664,000 in cash discounts and $742,000 in allowances for chargebacks and rebates. Discounts and allowances for the year ended December 31, 2005, consisted of $710,000 in cash discounts and allowances of $404,000 for chargebacks and rebates. Grant Revenue Grant revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $407,000 compared to $336,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $71,000, or 21.1%. Grant revenue is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred and our performance obligations under the terms of the respective contract are satisfied. Cost of Sales We recorded cost of sales of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $2.0 million, or 39.2%. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of $2.9 million in royalty fees, $2.6 million in inventory costs, $775,000 in amortization of intangible assets, $676,000 in charges for excess inventory and $215,000 in costs related to packaging, freight and stability testing. The charges for excess inventory were taken due to lower than anticipated primary care sales of Zanaflex Capsules. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of $1.6 in royalty fees, $434,000 in amortization of intangible assets, $1.0 million in inventory costs, $1.8 million in charges for excess inventory and $333,000 in costs related to packaging, freight, and stability testing. The charges for excess inventory were taken due to lower than anticipated primary sales of Zanaflex Capsules and because the current Zanaflex Capsules inventory has 36 month dating. Research and Development Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $12.1 million as compared to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of approximately $800,000, or 6.2%. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the termination of our former valrocemide collaboration agreement with Teva Phamaceutical Industries, Ltd. in June 2005. Our MS clinical development program expense increased from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $2.0 million or 50%, due to the continuation of increased activity in our Phase 3 clinical trial program. Other contract expenses decreased to $751,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, from $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $3.2 million or 81.2%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the termination of the valrocemide collaboration agreement in June 2005. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $19.1 million compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $6.0 million, or 45.8%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.0 million in salaries and benefits related to the expansion of our Zanaflex Capsules specialist sales force, an increase of $1.7 million in other selling related expenses resulting from the expansion of our Zanaflex Capsules specialist sales force and an increase of $1.3 million for marketing and distribution and sales administration expense related to the distribution of Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets. 68 General and Administrative General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $12.6 million compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $4.2 million, or 50.0%. The increase was attributable to the addition of a medical affairs department with $1.7 million of related expenses, $1.4 million due to increased general and administrative staff and salary costs related to being a public company and $875,000 related to increases in insurance expenses. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was a loss of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a loss of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of approximately $100,000, or 9.1%. Interest expense increased by $1.0 million principally due to interest expense related to the Paul Royalty Fund revenue interest agreement, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in interest income due to an increase in cash balances resulting from the completion of our initial public offering of common stock in February 2006 and a private placement of our common stock in October 2006 and a $75,000 increase in other income primarily due to a New York State tax refund. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which requires that the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on the awards original estimate of fair value. Results for prior periods have not been restated. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company changed its method of recognizing the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered from an actual basis to an estimate. This change resulted in the recognition of a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2006 of $454,000 compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2005. The cumulative effect adjustment represents the difference between compensation cost recognized through the date of adoption using actual forfeitures and the cost that would have been recognized to date using estimated forfeitures. Beneficial Conversion Feature, Accretion of Issuance Costs, Preferred Dividends and Fair Value of Warrants Issued to Convertible Preferred Stockholders Charges related to preferred stock increased to $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $17.4 million, or 93.6%, due to the recognition of the remaining unamortized portion of beneficial conversion charges of $48.5 million and issuance costs of $271,000 upon our completion of our initial public offering of our common stock in February 2006. These charges primarily comprised accretion of issuance costs on Series E, Series I and Series J mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock, accrual of preferred dividends of Series J and Series K mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock, accretion of beneficial conversion feature on Series A through Series I preferred stock for reset in conversion price, accretion of beneficial conversion feature on Series J preferred stock (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements). These charges were partially offset by the reversal of the cumulative preferred dividends of $12.7 million on Series J and Series K mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock during the year ended December 31, 2006, as they have been forfeited through completion of the initial public offering. 69 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Gross Sales We recognized revenue from the sale of Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2004. We recognize product sales using a deferred revenue recognition model meaning that shipments to wholesalers are recorded as deferred revenue and only recognized as revenue when end user prescriptions of the product are reported. Product sales in the year ended December 31, 2005, consist of Zanaflex tablet sales beginning in March 2005, which is when we began receiving prescription data for tablets containing a code clearly identifying these prescriptions as having been filled with product we sold, and Zanaflex Capsules prescription data beginning after our launch of the product in April 2005. Deferred revenue from Zanaflex Capsules was $5.2 million as of December 31, 2005, as compared to $0 as of December 31, 2004. The increase in deferred revenue of Zanaflex Capsules was a result of our launch of the product in April 2005. We expect deferred revenue from Zanaflex Capsules to increase in the future as our sales and marketing efforts ramp up, and prescription data continues to lag wholesaler shipments made in anticipation of demand. Deferred revenue from Zanaflex tablets was $11.5 million as of December 31, 2005, an increase of $4.8 million since December 31, 2004, as compared to $6.7 million as of December 31, 2004. The increase in deferred revenue of Zanaflex tablets resulted from increased shipment levels. Approximately $2.3 million of the deferred revenue at December 31, 2005 relates to product that we acquired from Elan that had an expiration date of less than 12 months at the time we sold it during 2004. We believe there is a high likelihood that this product will be returned, which would result in our inability to recognize the deferred revenue related to that shipped product. We expect deferred revenue from Zanaflex tablets to decline over time as we attempt to convert Zanaflex tablet sales to Zanaflex Capsules sales. Discounts and Allowances We recorded discounts and allowances of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Discounts and allowances are recorded when Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets are shipped to wholesalers. Discounts and allowances for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of $710,000 in cash discounts and $403,000 in allowances for chargebacks and rebates. Discounts and allowances for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of $128,000 in cash discounts and allowances of $207,000 for chargebacks and rebates. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2004, we took a $4.1 million charge to establish a reserve for expected returns of Zanaflex tablets sold by Elan prior to our acquisition of Zanaflex. As part of the acquisition of Zanaflex, we agreed to accept any returns of Zanaflex tablets that were returned subsequent to January 17, 2005, including returns of product that was originally sold by Elan. As part of our April 2005 launch of Zanaflex Capsules, in April, May and June 2005 we extended a 6% promotional cash discount over and above the standard 2% discount provided to drug wholesalers and a 4% rebate on products resold by the wholesalers to pharmacies, hospitals and other third parties. We expect cash discounts to decrease in future periods as a percentage of sales. Grant Revenue Grant revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $336,000 compared to $479,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Grant revenue is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred and our performance obligations under the terms of the respective contract are satisfied. 70 Cost of Sales We recorded cost of sales of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $885,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of $1.6 million in royalty fees, $434,000 in milestone amortization of intangible assets, $1.0 million in inventory costs, $1.8 million in charges for excess inventory and $333,000 in costs related to packaging, freight, and stability testing. The charges for excess inventory were taken due to lower than anticipated primary care sales of Zanaflex Capsules and because the initial Zanaflex Capsules launch inventory was purchased with only 24 month dating. The remaining Zanaflex Capsule inventory was purchased with 36 month dating. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted of $519,000 in royalty fees, $114,000 in milestone amortization of intangible assets and $252,000 in inventory costs related to the sale of Zanaflex tablets. We began incurring cost of sales upon the acquisition of Zanaflex in July 2004. Research and Development Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, were $12.9 million as compared to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of approximately $9.1 million, or 41.4%. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to completion of two Phase 3 clinical trials of Fampridine SR in SCI, and one Phase 2 clinical trial of Fampridine SR in MS, during the first quarter of 2004. The SCI clinical development program expense decreased from $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $32,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, due to our decision to put the program on hold. The MS clinical development program expense increased from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 37.9%, due to the launch of our Phase 3 clinical trial. Other contract expenses decreased to $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of 18.4%. This decrease is primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in expenses for the manufacture of clinical supplies from the period ended December 31, 2004, offset by an increase in expenses related to the valrocemide collaboration, primarily due to termination expense of $3.1 million. Operating expenses for clinical development and preclinical research and development decreased to $4.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $7.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 38.2%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of $1.2 million, to $625,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, salaries and benefits decreased by $914,000 due to a staff reduction in early 2005. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, were $13.1 million compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $8.4 million or 178.7%. This increase was primarily attributable to $4.0 million for marketing and distribution and sales administration expense related to the launch of Zanaflex Capsules and the distribution of Zanaflex tablets and $3.2 million in salaries and benefits related to our Zanaflex Capsules specialist sales force. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, were $8.4 million compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of approximately $4.9 million, or 36.8%. Total general and administrative expenses include non cash stock based compensation expense of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily attributable to the repricing in the first 71 quarter of 2004 of options granted prior to 2004. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2004 included approximately $1.2 million in outside NDA preparation services related to our Phase 3 trials of Fampridine SR in SCI. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) was a loss of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, versus a gain of $26,000 in the year ended December 31, 2004, a difference of $1.1 million. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $1.1 million primarily related to the $6.0 million secured term loan with GE Capital entered into in January 2005 as well as from interest costs related to the agreement with PRF entered into in December 2005. Beneficial Conversion Feature, Accretion of Issuance Costs, Preferred Dividends and Fair Value of Warrants Issued to Convertible Preferred Stockholders Charges related to preferred stock remained relatively flat at $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. These charges primarily comprised accretion of issuance costs on Series E, Series I and Series J mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock, accrual of preferred dividend on Series J and Series K mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock, accretion of beneficial conversion feature on Series A through Series I preferred stock for reset in conversion price and accretion of beneficial conversion feature on Series J preferred stock (see Notes 3, 8 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements). Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred annual operating losses since inception and, as of December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $232.1 million. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our securities, and, to a lesser extent, from loans, government grants and, more recently, our financing arrangement with PRF, our initial public offering of common stock in February 2006 and our private placement of common stock in October 2006. Our initial public offering in February 2006 resulted in the issuance of approximately 6.1 million shares of our common stock and the conversion of all of our outstanding convertible and mandatorily convertible preferred stock. In connection with the offering of common shares, we raised approximately $31.5 million, net of issuance costs. We completed a private placement in October 2006 in which approximately 3.2 million shares of our common stock were sold, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $29.8 million, net of issuance costs. Financing Arrangements In January 1997, Elan International Services, Ltd. (EIS) loaned us an aggregate of $7.5 million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes to partly fund our research and development activities. On December 23, 2005, EIS transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with Saints Capital. In December 2006, Saints Capital exercised the conversion option of their $2.5 million note and received 210,863 shares of common stock. The remaining $5.0 million convertible promissory note is convertible into 67,476 shares of common stock. In August and September 2002, we financed certain of our fixed assets through two financing agreements with General Electric Capital Corporation, or GE Capital, in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.2 million, which was repaid in full in September 2006. In January 2005, we entered into a $6.0 million senior secured term loan, which is collateralized by all of our personal property and fixtures, other than the property that secures our revenue interests assignment arrangement with PRF, of which $1.2 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2006. 72 On December 23, 2005, we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with PRF, a dedicated healthcare investment fund, pursuant to which we assigned to PRF the right to a portion of our net revenues (as defined in the agreement) from Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets and any future Zanaflex products. To secure our obligations to PRF, we also granted PRF a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to Zanaflex. Our agreement with PRF covers all Zanaflex net revenues generated from October 1, 2005 through and including December 31, 2015, unless the agreement terminates earlier. In November 2006, we entered into an amendment to the revenue interests assignment agreement with PRF. Under the terms of the amendment, PRF paid us $5.0 million in November 2006 and an additional $5.0 million is due as our net revenues during the fiscal year 2006 exceeded $25.0 million. This receivable is reflected in our 2006 financial statements. Under the terms of the amendment, we are required to pay PRF $5.0 million on December 1, 2009 and an additional $5.0 million on December 1, 2010. Under the agreement and the amendment, PRF is entitled to the following portion of Zanaflex net revenues: with respect to Zanaflex net revenues up to and including $30.0 million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement, 15% of such net revenues; with respect to Zanaflex net revenues in excess of $30.0 million but less than and including $60.0 million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement, 6% of such net revenues; and with respect to Zanaflex net revenues in excess of $60.0 million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement, 1% of such net revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, once PRF has received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least 2.1 times the aggregate amount PRF has paid us under the agreement, PRF will only be entitled to 1% of Zanaflex net revenues. In connection with the transaction, we have a liability recorded, referred to as the revenue interest liability, of approximately $23.1 million in accordance with EITF 88 18, Sales of Future Revenues. We will impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method and will record a corresponding accrued interest liability. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the life of the arrangement. The interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the level of Zanaflex sales. We currently estimate that the imputed interest rate associated with this liability will be approximately 4.5%. Payments made to PRF as a result of Zanaflex sales levels will reduce the accrued interest liability and the principal amount of the revenue interest liability. In consideration for our assignment of the right to receive a portion of Zanaflex net revenues (as defined in the agreement), PRF paid us $15.0 million at signing of the original agreement. We used approximately $3.0 million of the signing payment to repay a portion of the amount we owe to GE Capital, approximately $200,000 of the signing payment for fees and expenses associated with such repayment and $691,000 of the signing payment to reimburse PRF for expenses it estimated it incurred in the transaction. Under our agreement with PRF, we were required to use the remainder of the amount we received at signing and any other amounts we receive under the agreement or amendment to support commercialization, sales, marketing, clinical and regulatory activities and other financial obligations related specifically and solely to our Zanaflex operations. We may not use any proceeds from our agreement or amendment with PRF to support any of our other products unless such use is ancillary to the support of commercialization of Zanaflex. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including if we experience a change of control, undergo certain bankruptcy events, transfer any of our interests in Zanaflex (other than pursuant to a license agreement, development, commercialization, co promotion, collaboration, partnering or similar agreement), transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or breach certain of the covenants, 73 representations or warranties we make under the agreement, PRF may (i) require us to repurchase the rights we sold them at the put/call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or (ii) foreclose on the Zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to PRF. Except in the case of certain bankruptcy events, if PRF exercises its right, which we refer to as PRFs put option, to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it, PRF may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put/call price as required. If we experience a change of control we have the right, which we refer to as our call option, to repurchase the rights we sold to PRF at the put/call price in effect on the date such right is exercised. The put/call price on a given date is the greater of (i) all payments made by PRF to us as of such date, less all payments received by PRF from us as of such date, and (ii) an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to PRF of 25% on all payments made by PRF to us as of such date, taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by PRF from us as of such date. We have determined that PRFs put option and our call option meet the criteria to be considered an embedded derivative and should be accounted for as such. Therefore, we recorded a net liability of approximately $350,000 as of December 31, 2006 related to the put/call option to reflect its estimated fair value as of the date of the agreement, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities. This liability is revalued on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the fair value and any gain or loss resulting from the revaluation is recorded in earnings. During any period during which PRF has the right to receive 15% of Zanaflex net revenues (as defined in the agreement), then 8% of the first $30.0 million in payments from Zanaflex sales we receive from wholesalers will be distributed to PRF on a daily basis. Following the end of each fiscal quarter, if the aggregate amount actually received by PRF during such quarter exceeds the amount of net revenues PRF was entitled to receive, PRF will remit such excess to us. If the amount of net revenues PRF was entitled to receive during such quarter exceeds the aggregate amount actually received by PRF during such quarter, we will remit such excess to PRF. PRF also has the right to appoint a representative to receive all notices and materials provided to our board of directors and to attend as an observer all meetings of our board of directors, subject to certain exceptions. This right will terminate on the earlier to occur of February 10, 2010 (the fourth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering of shares of our common stock) or termination of the revenue interests assignment agreement. Investment Activities At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately $53.8 million, as compared to $13.8 million at December 31, 2005. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions and high quality government and investment grade corporate bonds. Also, we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances. As of December 31, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents were $18.1 million, as compared to $11.8 million as of December 31, 2005. Our short term investments consist of corporate debt securities with remaining maturities greater than three months and less than one year. The balance of these investments was $35.7 million as of December 31, 2006, as compared to $2.0 million as of December 31, 2005. Net Cash Used in Operations Net cash used in operations was $23.5 million and $20.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash used by operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily attributable to a net loss of $24.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities of $4.5 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 74 $3.7 million, a decrease in tablet deferred product revenue of $2.4 million and a decrease in returns liability of $1.8 million. Cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, was partially offset by non cash stock compensation expense of $3.8 million, an increase in capsule deferred product revenue of $6.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $1.8 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.3 million. Cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily attributable to a net loss of $35.5 million, an increase in inventory of $2.9 million, a decrease in returns liability of $2.3 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.9 million. Cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, was partially offset by an increase in tablet deferred product revenue of $5.2 million, an increase in capsule deferred product revenue of $4.8 million, non cash stock compensation expense of $4.4 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $7.4 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.3 million. Net Cash Used in/Provided by Investing Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $33.8 million, primarily due to $33.3 million in net purchases of short term investments. In addition, we purchased property and equipment of $527,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006. Net Cash Used in/Provided by Financing Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $63.6 million, primarily due to $31.5 million of initial public offering net proceeds, $29.8 million in private placement net proceeds, $5.0 million in net proceeds received from the PRF transaction and $670,000 in proceeds from option exercises, which was offset by $2.2 million in repayments to PRF and $1.0 million in repayments of notes payable. Future Capital Needs Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of revenue generated from sales of Zanaflex Capsules, the continued progress of our research and development activities, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the amount and timing of milestone or other payments made under collaborative agreements, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the acquisition of licenses to new products or compounds. We expect to incur losses from operations for at least the next several years as we continue to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure and increase our marketing efforts to support the commercialization of Zanaflex Capsules, continue our clinical development of Fampridine SR and advance our preclinical programs. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, debt repayments and capital equipment requirements through the first quarter of 2008. We may seek additional financing in the near future to ensure the completion of Fampridine SRs clinical development. To the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future operating requirements, we will need to raise additional capital, reduce cash expenditures or incur indebtedness to fund our operations. We may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail our sales and marketing efforts, delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research and development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. 75 Contractual Obligations and Commitments In January 2005, we entered into a $6.0 million senior secured term loan with GE Capital. In December 2005, we used a portion of the initial payment we received under our revenue interest assignment arrangement with PRF to repay approximately $3.0 million of this loan. We are required to pay monthly installments until February 2008, with interest only payments for the first six months followed by principal and interest payments for the remaining 29 months. Interest is fixed at the rate of 9.93% per annum. The loan is secured by all of our personal property and fixtures, other than the property that secures our arrangement with PRF. In January 1997, EIS loaned us an aggregate of $7.5 million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes. One promissory note in the principal amount of $5.0 million bears interest at a rate of 3% which began on the first anniversary of the note. The other promissory note in the amount of $2.5 million was non interest bearing. On December 23, 2005, EIS transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with Saints Capital. In December 2006, Saints Capital exercised the conversion option of the $2.5 million convertible promissory note at an exercise price of $11.856 per share and received 210,863 shares of common stock. The remaining $5.0 million convertible promissory note is convertible into 67,476 shares of common stock. Principal and interest are repayable, if not converted, ratably over a seven year period, beginning one year after we receive regulatory approval for certain products to be developed, subject to limitations related to gross margin on product sales. If we and Sants Capital determine that regulatory approval will not likely occur, the $5.0 million promissory note will automatically convert into the underlying common stock unless Saints Capital elects to have the amount due on the note cancelled. If our license and supply agreements with Elan are terminated for any other reason, the principal and interest is repayable ratably over 15 years. The $5.0 million promissory note restricts our ability to incur indebtedness that is senior to the note, subject to certain exceptions, including for our revenue interests assignment arrangement with PRF. Under our Zanaflex purchase agreement with Elan, we are obligated to make milestone payments to Elan of up to $19.5 million based on cumulative gross sales of Zanaflex tablets and Zanaflex Capsules. As of December 31, 2006, we have made or accrued $9.5 million of these milestone payments in the consolidated financial statements. Under our Zanaflex supply agreement with Elan, we are required to provide to Elan an 18 month rolling forecast at the beginning of each month and a two year forecast not later than July 1 of each year. We are required to order 100% of the forecast required quantities for each five month period immediately following each monthly forecast report. At December 31, 2006, the forecast requirement for the five month period following December 31, 2006 amounted to approximately $2.6 million. Under our Fampridine SR license agreement with Elan, we are obligated to make milestone payments to Elan of up to $15.0 million over the life of the contract and royalty payments as a percentage of product sales. In addition, under our various other research, license and collaboration agreements with other parties we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of approximately $16.8 million over the life of the contracts. In December 2005, we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with PRF pursuant to which we assigned PRF the right to receive a portion of our net revenues (as defined in the agreement which definition is different from our net revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP) from Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets and any future Zanaflex products. The agreement covers all such Zanaflex net revenues generated from October 1, 2005 through and including December 31, 2015, unless the agreement is terminated earlier. In consideration for the assignment, PRF paid us $15.0 million at signing. We used approximately $3.0 million of that payment to repay a portion of the amount we owe to GE Capital, $200,000 of that payment for expenses associated with such repayment and $691,000 of that payment to reimburse PRF for expenses it incurred in the transaction. Under our agreement with PRF, we are required to use the remainder of the amount we received at signing and any other amounts we receive under the agreement to support 76 commercialization, sales, marketing, clinical and regulatory activities and other financial obligations related specifically and solely to our Zanaflex operations. If our Zanaflex net revenues in 2005 had equaled or exceeded $11.0 million and our Zanaflex net revenues in the first six months of 2006 had equaled or exceeded $16.0 million, at our election, PRF would also have been required to loan us an additional $5.0 million. We did not meet this milestone. In November 2006, we entered into an amendment to the revenue interests assignment agreement with PRF. Under the amendment, PRF is entitled to a royalty consisting of certain specified percentages of Zanaflex net revenues, based upon the level of net revenues. Previously, once PRF had received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least twice the aggregate amount PRF paid us under the Agreement, the royalty rate would drop to 1% of Zanaflex net revenues. The amendment provides that the royalty rate will drop to 1% upon PRFs receipt of 2.1 times the aggregate amount PRF has paid us under the agreement, as amended. Under the terms of the amendment, PRF paid us $5.0 million in November 2006 and agreed that we would be entitled to an additional $5.0 million is due if our net revenues during the fiscal year 2006 equaled or exceeded $25.0 million. This milestone has been met and the receivable is reflected in our December 31, 2006 financial statements. This milestone payment was received in February 2007. Under the terms of the amendment, we are required to pay PRF $5.0 million on December 1, 2009 and an additional $5.0 million on December 1, 2010. The following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. This table does not reflect contingent milestone or royalty payments that may result in future periods from our collaborations, alliances and or license agreements. This table should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements: Twelve Month Period Ending December 31, Notes Payable(1) Operating Leases Inventory Purchase Commitment (in thousands) 2007 $ 1,140 $ 732 $ 2,599 2008 190 857 2009 860 Total $ 1,340 $ 2,449 $ 2,599 (1) Notes payable represents the principal and interest payable on the GE Capital notes payable and does not include the $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes payable to Saints Capital or milestone payments under our license agreements as these amounts are payable on contingent events. Under the terms of the employment agreement with our chief executive officer, Ron Cohen, we are obligated to pay severance under certain circumstances. If the employment agreement is terminated by us or by our chief executive officer for reasons other than for cause, we must pay an amount equal to (i) the base salary the chief executive officer would have received during the 15 month period immediately following the date of termination, plus (ii) the last annual bonus received by the chief executive officer multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year elapsed as of the termination date and the denominator of which is 365. Under the terms of the employment agreements with our chief scientific officer, Andrew Blight, our chief operating officer, Mary Fisher, our chief financial officer, David Lawrence and our general counsel, Jane Wasman, we are obligated to pay severance under certain circumstances. In the event we terminate our employment agreement with Dr. Blight, Ms. Fisher, Mr. Lawrence or Ms. Wasman without cause, or if one of them voluntarily terminates his or her agreements with good reason, we are obligated to make severance payments equal to nine months base annual salary, in the case of Dr. Blight and Ms. Fisher, and seven months base annual salary, in the case of Mr. Lawrence and Ms. Wasman, as well as COBRA premium payments for the severance period. In such event, all 77 options, stock appreciation rights awards and restricted stock awards that have vested as of the termination date shall remain exercisable for 90 days following such date. All unvested options, stock appreciation rights awards and stock awards will be cancelled on the date of termination. If Dr. Blight, Ms. Fisher, Mr. Lawrence or Ms. Wasman voluntarily terminates his or her employment without good reason or if we terminate his or her employment without cause within 18 months after a change in control, we are obligated to make severance payments equal to one years base annual salary, in the case of Dr. Blight and Ms. Fisher, and nine months base annual salary, in the case of Mr. Lawrence and Ms. Wasman, in each case paid in a lump sum within 30 days after termination, as well as COBRA premium payments for the severance period plus a bonus equal to the prior years bonus pro rated for the number of days worked prior to termination. We are also obligated to pay salary earned but not paid, vacation and sick leave days that have accrued, and reimbursable business expenses incurred through the date of termination. In such event, not less than 50% of the unvested options, stock appreciation rights and restricted or other stock awards shall become immediately and full vested and shall remain exercisable for 18 months following such date. All options that have vested as of the termination date shall remain exercisable for 90 days following such date. All unvested options, stock appreciation rights awards and stock awards will be cancelled on the date of termination. Effects of Inflation Our most liquid assets are cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Because of their liquidity, these assets are not directly affected by inflation. Because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements, we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, primarily employee compensation and contract services, which could increase our level of expenses. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies, which are more fully described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result. We have identified the following as our areas of critical accounting policies: sales revenue recognition, research and development, income taxes, and stock based compensation. Revenue Recognition We apply the revenue recognition guidance in SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When the Right of Return Exists, which among other criteria requires that future returns can be reasonably estimated in order to recognize revenue. Under SFAS 48 we are not permitted to recognize revenue until we can reasonably estimate the likely return rate for our products. Since we have only limited sales history with Zanaflex Capsules and due to generic competition and customer conversion from Zanaflex tablets to Zanaflex Capsules, we do not believe we can reasonably determine a return rate. As a result, we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model. At a future point in time, which could be in a number of years, when we are able to reasonably estimate product returns we will begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors. Under our deferred revenue model, we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our wholesale drug distributors. Instead, we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price, and 78 classify the cost basis of the inventory shipped as inventory held by others. We recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned. We use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized. We estimate prescription sales until the data becomes available, at which time adjustments are made to revenue and cost of sales to account for any differences between our estimates and the actual data. To date such differences have been immaterial. The estimated prescription sales are based on the average of the prior two months prescriptions for both Zanaflex tablets and Zanaflex Capsules. When we receive the prescription data, we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales. We then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold. We began receiving end user prescription data in March 2005 which enabled us to begin recognizing revenue from Zanaflex tablet sales. We began marketing Zanaflex Capsules in April 2005 and began receiving prescription data and recognizing revenue in the same month. In addition to the prescription data we purchase, we also receive data that we use to monitor trends in sales from wholesalers to their customers. We receive this data from an outside vendor on a monthly basis. This data includes the number of bottles shipped from certain wholesalers to their customers. We also compare our shipments to wholesalers to prescription reports to further assess inventory in the distribution channel on a monthly basis. We use the wholesaler sales trend data and the wholesaler vs. prescription comparison to better understand market conditions, but not as a basis for recognizing revenue. We accept returns of products for six months prior to and 12 months after their expiration date. Returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue, reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize. Research and Development Research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities including, salaries and benefits, occupancy costs, and research and development conducted for us by third parties, such as sponsored university based research, and clinical trial vendors. In addition, research and development expenses include expenses related to grant revenue and the cost of clinical trial drug supply shipped to our clinical study vendors. We account for our clinical study costs by estimating the patient cost per visit in each clinical trial and recognizing this cost as visits occur, beginning when the patient enrolls in the trial. This estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and patient related costs, including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial. Cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial, the site of the clinical trial, and the length of the treatment period for each patient. As actual costs become known to us, we adjust our accrual; such changes in estimate may be a material change in our clinical study accrual, which could also materially affect our results of operations. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We account for income taxes by the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end, based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. We have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured at December 31, 2006. 79 As of December 31, 2006, we had available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $144.7 million for federal and state income tax purposes, which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income, if any, and expire between 2010 and 2026 and research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately $1.3 million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes, if any, through 2018. Since our inception, we have incurred substantial losses and expect to incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Code, provides for a limitation of the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards (following certain ownership changes, as defined by the Code) that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards. We have experienced various ownership changes, as defined by the Code, as a result of past financings. Accordingly, our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited. Additionally, because U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes. Stock Based Compensation Historically, we accounted for share based compensation costs under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (SFAS No. 123), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which requires that the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application method, under which the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on the awards original estimate of fair value. Results for prior periods have not been restated. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we changed from recognizing the effect of forfeitures as they occur to estimating the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recognized forfeitures associated with its share based awards as they occurred rather than estimating forfeitures. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $454,225 during the three month period ended March 31, 2006, calculated as the difference between compensation cost recognized to date using actual forfeitures and the cost that would have been recognized to date using estimated forfeitures. We estimate that our future annual forfeiture rate will be 5%. We account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis in accordance with EITF No. 96 18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services, and FASB Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 15 and 25. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, grant receivable, notes payable, convertible notes payable, accounts payable, warrant liability, and put/call liability. The estimated fair values of all of our financial instruments, excluding convertible notes 80 payable to Saints Capital, approximate their carrying amounts at December 31, 2006. The terms of these notes are disclosed at Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. We have cash equivalents and short term investments at December 31, 2006, which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as our interest rates change. Due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds and corporate debt securities, the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximate their fair value at December 31, 2006. We maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields. Although our investments are subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment. Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. However, due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, interest rate risk is mitigated. We do not own derivative financial instruments. Accordingly, we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments.
