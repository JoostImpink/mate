ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL Managements Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") is the Companys analysis of its financial performance and of significant trends which may impact future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes thereto. Certain of the statements made in the Companys MD&A are forward looking statements related to the transition to integrated solution sales and are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: unanticipated delays in implementation/transition to delivery of integrated solutions; uncertainty in oil and gas markets; competitive factors and pricing pressures; timing of development and acceptance of new product/services; technical obsolescence of the Companys products/services; inability to recruit required sales management, marketing and consulting personnel; and the risks detailed from time to time in the Companys SEC reports, including the Form 8 K filed on April 2, 1996 that identifies certain of these risk factors. The Company, incorporated in 1982, designs, markets and supports software and systems which are used in exploration and production efforts of oil and gas companies worldwide. The Company derives revenues from licensing software products, providing related professional and consulting services and reselling hardware. In most instances, customers pay the Company an initial license fee for the software. Generally, revenue from software is recognized by the Company upon shipment. Customers have the option to pay an annual maintenance fee, calculated as a percentage of current list price, which entitles them to routine support and product updates. The Company generally recognizes revenues related to customer support agreements ratably over the contract period. See Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. Many of the Companys customers are shifting from functional organizations to interdisciplinary teams, which is creating the need for integrated products and service sales. Accordingly, the Companys sales, marketing and support organizations are currently being configured to better address the emerging "solutions" market. These solution sales have the longer term potential of generating larger contracts and more recurring revenue; however, they can also lengthen customers decision making processes. The Company believes that its competitors are dealing with similar changes in their sales and marketing organizations. The transition of the Companys sales organization may continue through fiscal year 1997. The transition includes recruiting additional professional sales management and strengthening market capabilities, as well as building a professional and technical consulting organization. This transition may have a negative impact on the Companys growth during this period but should position the Company for the ongoing prospects that the market has to offer over the longer term. On March 25, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Advance Geophysical Corporation ("Advance") in an acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests. On September 28, 1994, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of Stratamodel, Inc. ("Stratamodel") in an acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests. On September 29, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of MGI Associates, Inc. ("MGA") in an acquisition accounted for as a purchase. On February 28, 1995, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed related liabilities of DRD Corporation ("DRD") in an acquisition accounted for as a purchase. On June 5, 1995, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of GeoGraphix, Inc. ("GeoGraphix") in an acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests. On September 20, 1995, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tech Logic, Inc. ("Tech Logic") in an acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests. Due to the immateriality of this transaction and its effect on the historical financial statements of the Company for prior periods, those statements have not been restated to reflect the operating results and financial condition of Tech Logic. On March 29, 1996, the Company purchased the general application software operations of Western Atlas International, Inc. ("WAII") in an acquisition accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein give effect to the acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests (other than Tech Logic) for all periods presented and include the results of acquired 16 18 operations accounted for as purchases and Tech Logic since the dates of acquisition. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the related notes thereto. PROPOSED MERGER On June 30, 1996, the Company and Halliburton Company ("Halliburton") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") providing for the merger (the "Merger") of the Company with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Halliburton. The Merger Agreement provides for the exchange of 0.574 shares of Halliburton common stock for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock and for all outstanding options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock to be assumed by the corporation surviving the Merger and converted into options to purchase shares of Halliburton common stock. The Merger transaction is subject to the Companys shareholder approval and is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. No adjustments have been made in the accompanying audited financial statements of the Company to give effect to the Merger because the proposed transaction has not been consummated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues or of their respective revenue components and the percentage change in the dollar amount of those items for each of the years in the three year period ended June 30, 1996.

FISCAL 1996 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1995 Total revenue. Total revenue for the year ended June 30, 1996 ("FY1996") increased $16.1 million, or nine percent, from total revenue for the year ended June 30, 1995 ("FY1995"). This increase is mainly attributable to a 34 percent growth in services revenue. International revenue comprised approximately 52 percent of total revenue in FY1996 as compared to 56 percent in FY1995. Software product sales. Software product sales consist of license fees for the Companys proprietary and third party software. Software product sales decreased by $447,000, or one percent, from FY1995. Software product sales as a percentage of total revenue was 44 percent in FY1996 compared to 49 percent in FY1995. The Company expects that this revenue should continue to be a significant portion of total revenue but will decline in the future as a percentage of total revenue as the Company expands its professional services market. 17 19 Hardware product sales. Hardware product sales relate to the resale of third party computer hardware. Hardware product sales decreased $2.6 million, or 8 percent, from FY1995. This decrease is due primarily to the Companys decision to offer hardware sales only to customers who desire comprehensive system solutions. Services. Services revenue relates to maintenance and support of the Companys hardware and software products, and increasingly from revenue from a variety of other professional services, including implementation, consulting and integration of applications. Services revenue in FY1996 increased $19.1 million, or 34 percent, from FY1995. Maintenance support revenues increased by $10.8 million, or 26 percent, from FY1995 due mainly to the continued expansion of the installed base of the Company. Professional services revenue increased $8.3 million, or 60 percent, from FY1995 as a result of the Companys emphasis on professional and technical consulting services. Cost of software product sales. Cost of software product sales as a percentage of software revenue was 12 percent in both FY1996 and FY1995. Cost of hardware product sales. Cost of hardware product sales as a percentage of hardware product sales increased to 91 percent in FY1996 compared to 83 percent FY1995. The Companys offering of sales discounts to customers in response to competitive pressures, particularly in the United States market, negatively affected margins on hardware product sales in FY1996. As price competitiveness in the computer hardware industry persists, discounts and the resulting impact on hardware margins may continue. Although hardware product contributes a lower margin, the Company plans to offer hardware sales only to customers who desire comprehensive solution sales. Cost of services. Cost of services as a percentage of the related revenue decreased from 59 percent in FY1995 to 51 percent in FY1996. This decrease in cost as a percentage of related revenue is mainly attributable to the combination of higher maintenance support revenue associated with the expanding installed base with only a minimal increase in related cost, offset by increased costs related to the higher revenue from professional services revenue. Research and development. Research and development costs increased $5.1 million, or 25 percent, from FY1995. This increase over the prior year relates primarily to the addition of the MGA development function and the related costs. The Company believes that continued investments in research and development are important to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace. The Company capitalized $6.2 million or 20 percent of total research and development costs during FY1996 as compared to $3.7 million or 16 percent in FY1995 due to the increased level and range of products under development. The Company amortized $3.8 million and $3.5 million of capitalized software costs in FY1996 and FY1995, respectively. Selling, marketing and administrative. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $10.0 million, or 17 percent from the FY1995 amount. As a percentage of revenue, these costs were 37 percent in FY1996 compared to 34 percent in FY1995. The increase primarily is a result of the increased costs of approximately $5.5 million associated with the transition of the sales, marketing and support organizations. In addition, increased costs of approximately $2.0 million related to the upgrade of the Companys information system infrastructure were incurred in FY1996. Acquired research and development costs. Acquired research and development costs of $11.3 million for FY1996 relate primarily to the in process research and development activities acquired in connection with the WAII acquisition. The Company reviewed the status of the acquired research and development activities and determined that certain projects require further development by the Company and that technological feasibility had not been established for certain of these activities under the Companys software development plans and method to account for software development costs. In addition to determining whether technological feasibility had been reached, the Company determined that these projects did not have alternative future uses to the Company. Therefore, a separate valuation of the replacement cost of these activities was performed and resulted in a valuation of $11.0 million. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this amount was expensed at the date of the WAII acquisition. The Company expects to incur approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million during the next 12 to 18 months to document, merge and embed the acquired code and development activities into products to be released in the future. 18 20 In FY1995, $3.7 million was expensed as research and development costs as a result of a similar evaluation performed in connection with the purchase of certain assets of DRD. Restructuring, merger and other costs. In July 1995, the Company completed a strategic planning process which concluded with the decision to proactively realign its resources. A restructuring charge of $3.1 million was recorded in FY1996 to reflect severance costs for terminated employees, facility consolidation and write down of certain assets of the Company. In March 1996, a charge of $1.0 million was recorded to reflect the write off of redundant assets and activities as a result of the WAII acquisition. This charge included approximately $688,000 for capitalized software that would be replaced by acquired WAII applications and the remaining for personnel and related costs. Merger costs of $4.5 million in 1995 consist of advisor fees related to the acquisitions of Stratamodel and GeoGraphix and certain restructuring, termination and relocation charges related to the Stratamodel acquisition. Taxes. During FY1996, the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate and lower than the prior years rate. The effective rate decreased primarily due to benefits recognized from the Companys Foreign Sales Corporation. FISCAL 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1994 Total revenue. Total revenue for the year ended June 30, 1995 ("FY1995") increased approximately 20% compared to total revenue for the year ended June 30, 1994 ("FY1994"). The increase in total revenue was primarily due to increased sales to international markets and the addition of the MGA product line. The Companys continued expansion into developing markets in Europe, Asia and Latin America contributed to the increase in international revenue of approximately 28 percent over the FY1994 amounts. International revenue comprised approximately 56 percent of total revenue in FY1995 as compared to 53 percent in FY1994. FY1995 revenue includes approximately $12.0 million related to the MGA product line which was acquired in the first quarter of FY1995. Software product sales. Software product sales consist of license fees for the Companys proprietary and third party software. The increase in software product sales of approximately 19 percent over the prior fiscal year was attributable to new product offerings, acquired product lines and strengthened sales of the Companys core products. As a percentage of total revenues, software product sales remained constant at 49 percent. The software product sales increase of approximately $13.4 million resulted in a positive impact on gross profit. The Companys strategy of offering petroleum companies a complete spectrum of software applications has had a positive impact on software product sales. Hardware product sales. Hardware product sales relate to the resale of third party computer hardware. Hardware product sales remained constant at approximately $31.8 million. As a percentage of total revenue, hardware product sales decreased from 22 percent in FY1994 to 19 percent in FY1995. This decrease is due primarily to the Companys decision to continue to shift away from sales of hardware to sales of software. Services. Services revenue relates to maintenance and support of the Companys hardware and software products as well as revenues from training and consulting. As a percentage of total revenue, services increased from 29 percent in FY1994 to 32 percent in FY1995; services increased approximately $14.5 million, or 35 percent, from the previous year. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a 59 percent increase in software maintenance revenues which resulted from the expanding installed base of the Companys products and a $3.6 million contribution by MGA. Hardware maintenance revenues remained constant at approximately $6.6 million. The Companys hardware maintenance revenues have been impacted by the presence of third party companies that offer hardware maintenance at often lower prices. In response to this trend, the Company began outsourcing hardware maintenance business activities in FY1995. Cost of software product sales. Cost of software product sales, as a percentage of software revenue, increased from 9 percent in FY1994 to 12 percent in FY1995. Increased royalty costs resulting from higher sales of third party applications and increased embedding of third party applications in the Companys products has negatively impacted the current years software product margins. Cost of hardware product sales. Cost of hardware product sales, as a percentage of hardware product sales, remained constant at 83 percent in FY1995 and FY1994. Although hardware contributes a lower 19 21 margin, the Company plans to continue to offer hardware to accommodate sales of software and services to customers who desire comprehensive solutions. Cost of services. Cost of services decreased as a percentage of the related revenues from 65 percent in FY1994 to 59 percent in FY1995. While preserving hardware maintenance revenues, the Company reduced expenses by discontinuing processing services and outsourcing hardware maintenance services. These decisions have positively impacted the services margin. Research and development. Research and development costs increased 8 percent during FY1995 over the prior year. The increase over the prior year relates to the addition of the MGA development function and the related costs. The Company believes that continued investments in research and development are important to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace. The increase in costs was partially offset by a higher level of capitalized software costs during FY1995. The Company capitalized approximately $3.7 million or 16 percent of total research and development costs during FY1995 as compared to approximately $2.7 million or 13 percent in FY1994 due to the increased level and range of products under development. The Company amortized $3.5 million and $2.3 million of capitalized software costs in FY1995 and FY1994, respectively. Selling, marketing and administrative. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased approximately $13.5 million from the FY1994 amount. As a percentage of revenue, the costs increased from 32 percent in FY1994 to 34 percent in FY1995. The increase relates to incremental costs associated with the addition of the MGA operations and increased selling costs related to expanding the Companys presence in Europe and Asia. Acquired research and development costs. Acquired research and development costs of $3.7 million which approximate 2 percent of total revenues for FY1995, relate to in process development activities for projects which were acquired in connection with the DRD purchase, but had not yet reached technological feasibility. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this amount was expensed at the date of acquisition. Restructuring, merger and other costs. Restructuring and other non recurring charges, which approximate one percent of total revenue for FY1995, relate to the Companys restructuring plan which was designed to eliminate redundancies and consolidate the Stratamodel operations. Management expects this restructuring plan to result in reduced spending for the Company. Additionally, non recurring costs, including relocation and other acquisition related charges, were incurred in connection with the Stratamodel acquisition. Merger costs, which approximate less than 2 percent of total revenue for FY1995, consist of accounting, legal and investment banking costs related to the acquisitions of Stratamodel and GeoGraphix. Merger costs for FY1995 decreased approximately $11.0 million from FY1994 primarily due to the inclusion in prior year of a compensation charge related to Advances Phantom Stock Plan. Other income, net. Other income, net increased approximately $1.4 million from FY1994 to FY1995. This increase was primarily attributable to higher net interest income resulting from higher investment yields on invested funds. Taxes. During FY1995, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate and lower than the prior years rate. The effective rate decreased primarily due to recognition of deferred tax benefits of an acquired company. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which approximated $2.2 million at June 30, 1995, relates to certain deferred assets associated with an acquired company. Full realization of the total benefit is dependent upon, among other things, the Companys ability to maintain the present level of earnings. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents decreased $5.8 million from June 30, 1995. Cash provided by operating activities for FY1996 was $41.3 million offset by cash used in investing activities of $35.5 million and cash used in financing activities of $11.6 million. Trade accounts receivable increased $6.1 million from June 30, 1995, due primarily to higher fourth quarter FY1996 revenues, offset by increased collection efforts. Adjusted for non revenue accounts receivable, the Companys FY1996 and fourth quarter days sales outstanding were 102 days and 87 days, respectively. 20 22 Management intends to focus efforts on maintaining a quarterly days sales outstanding within a 80 to 90 day range. Software development costs, net increased by $4.7 million from June 30, 1995 due to the $1.3 million of software development costs recorded in connection with the WAII acquisition, $1.0 million in connection with Argus as defined below, $700,000 in connection with other acquisitions and the $6.2 million of costs capitalized during FY1996. These additions were offset by $3.8 million of amortization of software development costs in FY1996 and a $688,000 write off in connection with the WAII acquisition. The Company will continue to incur substantial software development costs in the future. Goodwill increased $11.1 million from June 30, 1995. This increase is primarily attributable to the $4.6 million of goodwill recorded from the WAII acquisition and to a guarantee of $6.9 million of future payments related to the MGA acquisition. The initial MGA guaranteed payment of $1.8 million was paid in September 1995. Additional MGA guaranteed payments of $2.3 million and $2.8 million are due in September 1996 and 1997, respectively. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $9.2 million from June 30, 1995 due partially to the recording of the $2.3 million current liability related to the second MGA guaranteed payment that is due on September 30, 1996. The remainder of the increase was due to timing of the receipt and payment of vendor invoices. Based on the nature of these accounts, period to period fluctuations can be expected to continue. Current maturities of long term debt increased by $2.0 million due to the recording of the $3.0 million line of credit guarantee related to the MGA acquisition offset by the payoff of $1.0 of the term and credit revolver in October 1995. Other long term liabilities increased by $2.9 million from June 30, 1996. This increase mainly represents the final MGA guaranteed payment that is due to be paid September 30, 1997. Long term debt decreased by $11.0 million from June 30, 1995 as a result of the payoff of the term loan and credit revolver in October 1995. The Companys primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations. External sources of liquidity include debt and equity financing. On December 15, 1995, the Company terminated its $25.0 million credit facility and entered into a $100.0 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of seven banks. The agreement contains certain restrictive and financial covenants, including those related to indebtedness, net worth and fixed charges, and provides for guarantees by certain subsidiaries of Landmark. At June 30, 1996, there were $4.4 million in letters of credit and no revolving loans outstanding under this facility and the Company was in compliance with the aforementioned loan covenants. The Company believes funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future. In connection with the MGA transaction, the Company acquired an option to purchase the equity interests of a corporation owned by certain of the former shareholders of MGA ("Argus") in exchange for a $3.0 million line of credit guarantee. On April 29, 1996, this option agreement was terminated and the Company was assigned ownership of certain software previously owned by Argus. The Company made interest payments on behalf of Argus through June 30, 1996, and recorded $3.0 million as short term debt as the Company believed it would be called to perform on the $3.0 million outstanding under the Argus credit agreement. On July 1, 1996, the Company paid off the $3.0 million outstanding under this credit agreement. The Company has not paid cash dividends since its inception and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the future. The Company presently intends to retain earnings for use in its business, with any future decision to pay cash dividends dependent on the Companys growth, profitability, financial condition and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Furthermore, certain provisions of the Companys revolving credit agreement restrict the Companys ability to pay cash dividends. Management continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire products, technologies or businesses. These acquisition opportunities may involve the use of cash or, depending upon the size and terms of the acquisition, may require debt or equity financing. Expenses associated with these potential acquisitions and post acquisition integration issues may have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations in the period the transactions are consummated or the periods shortly thereafter. 21 23
