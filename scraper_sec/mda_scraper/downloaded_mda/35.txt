ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSHEI and Hawaiian Electric (in the case of Hawaiian Electric, only the information related to Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries):The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this report. For information on factors that may cause HEIs and Hawaiian Electrics actual future results to differ from those currently contemplated by the relevant forward looking statements, see Forward Looking Statements at the front of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. The general discussion of HEIs consolidated results should be read in conjunction with the Electric utility and Bank segment discussions that follow. HEI ConsolidatedExecutive overview and strategy. HEI is a holding company with operations primarily focused on Hawaiis electric utility and banking sectors. In 2017, HEI formed Pacific Current to make investments in non regulated renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure projects. HEI has three reportable segmentsElectric utility, Bank, and Other.Electric utility. Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric (Utilities) are regulated operating electric public utilities engaged in the production, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity on the islands of Oahu; Hawaii; and Maui, Lanai and Molokai, respectively.Bank. ASB is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers in the State of Hawaii and has 49 branches on branches on the islands of Oahu (34), Maui (6), Hawaii (5), Kauai (3), and Molokai (1).Other. The Other segment comprises HEIs corporate level operating, general and administrative expenses and the results of Pacific Current.A major focus of HEIs financial strategy is to grow core earnings/profitability of its Utilities and Bank in a controlled risk manner and improve operating, capital and tax efficiencies in order to support its dividend and deliver shareholder value, while at the same time, serving as a catalyst for change to improve the Hawaii economy, environment and community. Together, HEIs unique combination of power and financial services companies provides the Company with a strong balance sheet and the financial resources to invest in the strategic growth of its subsidiaries, while providing an attractive dividend for investors.HEI is fully committed to a 100 percent renewable future for Hawaii. The Companys electric utility is on track to achieve the next RPS milestone of 30% in 2020having achieved an RPS of 27% for 2018, with approximately 475 MW of additional renewable generation contracted under PPAs (subject to PUC approval). Since 2011, the Companys electric utility reduced the oil used to generate electricity by 1.58 million barrels and have cut greenhouse gas emissions by 18.9% compared to a 2010 baseline.

The increase in the Utilities 2018 net income compared to 2017 was principally due to higher RAM/MPIR revenues, rate relief, the 2017 reduction of non regulated deferred tax balances to reflect lower tax rates enacted by the Tax Act, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in the Banks net income was primarily due to higher net interest income as a result of an increase in earning asset balances and yields and lower income tax expense as a result of the lower federal corporate tax rates from the Tax Act, partially offset by higher compensation and provision for loans losses. The other segments net loss was higher primarily due to higher interest and compensation expenses and lower tax benefits on expenses as a result of tax reform, partially offset by higher operating income from a full year of Pacific Current results. See Electric utility, Bank, and HEI ConsolidatedOther segment sections below for additional information on year to year fluctuations.In 2017, net income for HEI common stock was $165 million ($1.52 diluted earnings per common share), down (34)% from $248 million ($2.29 diluted earnings per common share) in 2016, primarily due to the merger termination fee paid in 2016 by NEE. Excluding NEE related income and expenses ($60 million after tax), the decrease in net income from 2016 to 2017 was composed of the Utilities $22 million lower net income and the other segments $10 million higher net loss, partly offset by ASBs $10 million higher net income. Impacting these results were $14.2 million ($9.2 million at the Utilities; $(1.0) million at ASB; $6.0 million at the other segment) of net loss, primarily composed of tax expenses/(benefits) to reduce deferred tax balances to reflect the lower rates enacted by the Tax Act and an ASB special employee bonus awarded after the passing of the Tax Act lowered corporate income taxes in the future. The Companys effective tax rate was lower in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the provision in the Tax Act that lowered the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the related amortization of excess deferred income taxes. In addition, the rate was further lowered by certain adjustments made in conjunction with the filing of the Companys 2017 tax returns, including an increased pension deduction taken resulting in a net income tax benefit of $5 million associated with the rate differential. The lower tax rate was partially offset by other Tax Act changes, including the non deductibility of excess executive compensation and various fringe benefit costs. The Companys effective tax rate was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the (1) 2017 adjustment to accumulated deferred income tax balances (ADIT) (exclusive of ADIT related to the regulated rate base of the Utilities) for the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%, (2) 2016 deductibility of previously non tax deductible merger costs and (3) higher tax benefits recognized in 2016 for the domestic production activities deduction (DPAD) related to the Utilities generation activities.

In 2016, a 4.41% senior note was refinanced to a lower rate Eurodollar term loan. In late December 2017, Hamakua Energy closed on $67 million of 4.02% senior secured notes.Income tax benefit (expense) 5 (9) 14 In 2017, HEIs other segment included $5.7 million of tax reform related tax expense, primarily to reduce net deferred tax asset balances to reflect the lower federal tax rate. In 2016, HEIs other segment included $25 million of tax expense relating to the previously proposed merger and spin off (net of taxes), comprised of taxes on merger termination fee and reimbursements of expenses from NEE and insurance ($34 million), partly offset by additional tax benefits on the previously non tax deductible merger and spin off related expenses incurred in previous years ($6 million) and tax on 2016 merger related expenses ($3 million). In 2016, HEIs results also included other tax benefits recognized as a result of moving out of a federal net operating loss position.Net income (loss) (22) 49 (71) Economic conditions. The statistical data in this section is from public third party sources that management believes to be reliable (e.g., Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT), University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR), Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA), Honolulu Board of REALTORS and national and local newspapers).Hawaiis tourism industry, a significant driver of Hawaiis economy, ended 2018 with growth in both visitor spending and arrivals. Visitor expenditures increased 6.8% and arrivals increased 5.9% in 2018 compared to 2017. Hawaiis unemployment rate increased to 2.5% for December 2018, which was higher than the rate for December 2017 and lower than the national unemployment rate of 3.9%. It is also the second lowest unemployment rate in the nation.Hawaii real estate activity, as indicated by the home resale market, experienced a growth in median sales prices for single family homes and condominiums in 2018. Median sales prices for single family residential homes and condominiums on Oahu through December 2018 were higher by 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, over the same time period in 2017. The number of closed sales for single family residential homes and condominiums were down by 7.7% and 2.5%, respectively, through December of 2018, compared to same time period of 2017.Hawaiis petroleum product prices reflect supply and demand in the Asia Pacific region and the price of crude oil in international markets. Although the price of crude oil fluctuates month to month, the recent trend over the last quarter has been a decreasing one which followed a 2.5 year stretch of general increases.At its December 2018 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate from 2.25% to 2.50% in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation. At its meeting in January 2019, Hawaiis Council on Revenues lowered its forecast for growth in the State General Fund tax revenue in fiscal year 2019 from 5.0% to 4.2%. While the economy is still performing well, the Councils decision to lower the estimate was based on the expectation of slower economic growth than in the past year and uncertainty about the future. The hotel employee strike, which started in early October 2018 and impacted thousands of hotel workers, ended after nearly two months. The partial Federal government shutdown then took effect in late December 2018 until January 25, 2019 when a stopgap bill was passed and signed to temporarily reopen the government through February 15, 2019. Most of the states federal employees are defense related and were not impacted by the shutdown. The two most popular visitor attractions, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, remained open during the shutdown with the support of alternative funding sources. Potential risks to the Hawaii economy include visitor infrastructure constraints, tight labor markets paired with moderate income gain and high housing costs, creating inflationary pressures. International trade tariffs and natural disasters also remain a source of great uncertainty.Liquidity and capital resources. As a result of the Tax Act, utility property is no longer eligible for bonus depreciation. Consequently, the initial cash requirement for future capital projects will generally increase approximately 10% because of the 34loss of the immediate tax benefit from bonus depreciation. The Company believes that its ability to generate cash, both internally from electric utility and banking operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities, commercial paper and bank borrowings, is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its contractual obligations and commercial commitments, its forecasted capital expenditures and investments, its expected retirement benefit plan contributions and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future.The consolidated capital structure of HEI (excluding deposit liabilities and other bank borrowings) was as follows:December 312018 2017(dollars in millions) Short term borrowingsother than bank$74 2% $118 3%Long term debt, netother than bank1,880 45 1,684 43Preferred stock of subsidiaries34 1 34 1Common stock equity2,162 52 2,097 53 $4,150 100% $3,933 100%HEIs commercial paper borrowings and line of credit facility were as follows: Year endedDecember 31, 2018 (in millions)Averagebalance End of periodbalance December 31,2017Commercial paper$50 $49 $63Line of credit draws Undrawn capacity under HEIs line of credit facility 150 150Note: This table does not include Hawaiian Electrics separate commercial paper issuances and line of credit facilities and draws, which are disclosed below under Electric utilityFinancial ConditionLiquidity and capital resources. The maximum amount of HEIs short term borrowings in 2018 was $74.5 million.HEI utilizes short term debt, typically commercial paper, to support normal operations, to refinance commercial paper, to retire long term debt, to pay dividends and for other temporary requirements, including short term financing needs of its subsidiaries. HEI also periodically makes short term loans to Hawaiian Electric to meet Hawaiian Electrics cash requirements, including the funding of loans by Hawaiian Electric to Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, but no such short term loans to Hawaiian Electric were outstanding as of December 31, 2018. HEI periodically utilizes long term debt, historically unsecured indebtedness, to fund investments in and loans to its subsidiaries to support their capital improvement or other requirements, to repay long term and short term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes. See Notes 5 and 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a brief description of the Companys loans. HEI has a $150 million line of credit facility with no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2018. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The rating of HEIs commercial paper and debt securities could significantly impact the ability of HEI to sell its commercial paper and issue debt securities and or the cost of such debt. As of February 13, 2019, the Fitch, Moodys and S&P ratings of HEI were as follows: FitchMoodysS&PLong term issuer default and senior unsecured; long term rating; corporate credit; respectivelyBBBWR*BBB Commercial paperF3P 3A 3OutlookStableStableStable* Moodys long term debt rating was withdrawn because HEI does not currently have any outstanding, publicly traded debt. Moodys continues to rate Hawaiian Electrics long term debt. See Electric utility MD&A.Note: The above ratings reflect only the view, at the time the ratings are issued or affirmed, of the applicable rating agency, from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Issuances of common stock through the Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), Hawaiian Electric Industries Retirement Savings Plan (HEIRSP) and the ASB 401(k) Plan provided new capital of $30 million (approximately 1 million shares) in 2016. From January 1, 2016 through January 5, 2016, and from December 7, 2016 to date, HEI satisfied the share purchase requirements of the DRIP, HEIRSP and ASB 401(k) Plan through open market 35purchases of its common stock rather than new issuances. Also, from June 2, 2016 through August 9, 2016, HEI satisfied the share purchase requirements of the HEIRSP and ASB 401(k) Plan through open market purchases of its common stock. Operating activities provided net cash of $499 million in 2018, $420 million in 2017 and $496 million in 2016. Investing activities used net cash of $792 million in 2018, $815 million in 2017 and $736 million in 2016. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to capital expenditures, purchases of available for sale investment securities, net increase in loans held for investment, purchases of held to maturity investment securities, purchase of stock from Federal Home Loan Bank and contributions to low income housing investments, partly offset by receipt of repayments from available for sale investment securities, contributions in aid of construction, proceeds from the sale of commercial loans, redemption of stock from Federal Home Loan Bank and repayments from held to maturity investment securities. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a Hawaiian Electrics consolidated capital expenditures (net of contributions in aid of construction), Hamakua Energys acquisition of a power plant and ASBs purchases of investment securities, partly offset by the repayments of investment securities, proceeds from sale of commercial loans and a net decrease in loans held for investment. Financing activities provided net cash of $200 million in 2018, $378 million in 2017 and $219 million in 2016. In 2018, net cash provided by financing activities included proceeds from issuance of long term debt, net increases in deposits and retail repurchase agreements, partly offset by payment of common and preferred stock dividends, long term debt maturities and net decreases in short term debt and other bank borrowings. In 2017, net cash provided by financing activities included net increases in deposits and long term debt and net increases in short term borrowings and ASBs retail repurchase agreements, partly offset by a net decrease in ASBs other borrowings and payment of common and preferred stock dividends. Other than capital contributions from their parent company, intercompany services (and related intercompany payables and receivables), Hawaiian Electrics periodic short term borrowings from HEI (and related interest) and the payment of dividends to HEI, the electric utility and bank segments are largely autonomous in their operating, investing and financing activities. (See the electric utility and bank segments discussions of their cash flows in their respective Financial condition Liquidity and capital resources sections below.) During 2018, Hawaiian Electric, ASB (through ASB Hawaii) and Pacific Current paid cash dividends to HEI of $103 million, $50 million and $1 million, respectively.A portion of the net assets of Hawaiian Electric and ASB is not available for transfer to HEI in the form of dividends, loans or advances without regulatory approval. In the absence of an unexpected material adverse change in the financial condition of the electric utilities or ASB, such restrictions are not expected to significantly affect the operations of HEI, its ability to pay dividends on its common stock or its ability to meet its debt or other cash obligations. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Forecasted HEI consolidated net cash used in investing activities (excluding investing cash flows from ASB) for 2019 through 2021 consists primarily of the net capital expenditures of the Utilities, estimated to range from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion over the next three years. In addition to the funds required for the Utilities construction programs and debt maturities (see Electric utilityLiquidity and capital resources), approximately $50 million will be required in 2021 to repay HEIs $50 million private placement note maturing in March 2021, which is expected to be repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, bank borrowings, other medium or long term debt, common stock and or dividends from subsidiaries. Additional debt and or equity financing may be utilized to invest in the Utilities, bank or Pacific Current; to pay down commercial paper or other short term borrowings; or to fund unanticipated expenditures not included in the 2019 through 2021 forecast, such as increases in the costs of or an acceleration of the construction of capital projects of the Utilities or unanticipated utility capital expenditures. In addition, existing debt may be refinanced prior to maturity with additional debt or equity financing (or both).36Selected contractual obligations and commitments. Information about payments under the specified contractual obligations and commercial commitments of HEI and its subsidiaries was as follows:December 31, 2018 (in millions)Less than1 year 1 3years 3 5years More than5 years TotalContractual obligations Investment in qualifying affordable housing projects$6 $11 $ $1 $18Time certificates509 236 80 3 828Other bank borrowings110 110Short term borrowings74 74Long term debt4 154 360 1,372 1,890Interest on CDs, other bank borrowings, short term loan and long term debt95 170 150 797 1,212Operating leases, service bureau contract, and maintenance agreements24 34 15 11 84Hawaiian Electric open purchase order obligations175 7 3 85Hawaiian Electric fuel oil purchase obligations (estimate based on December 31, 2018 fuel oil prices)140 16 156Hawaiian Electric power purchaseminimum fixed capacity obligations119 195 118 279 711Liabilities for uncertain tax positions 2 2Total (estimated)$1,156 $825 $726 $2,463 $5,1701Includes contractual obligations and commitments for capital expenditures and expense amounts.The table above does not include other categories of obligations and commitments, such as deferred taxes, trade payables, amounts that will become payable in future periods under collective bargaining and other employment agreements and employee benefit plans, and potential refunds of amounts collected from ratepayers (e.g., under the earnings sharing mechanism). As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of the Companys retirement benefit plans did not exceed the retirement benefit plans benefit obligation. Minimum funding requirements for retirement benefit plans have not been included in the tables above; however, see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2019 estimated contributions.See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of fuel and power purchase commitments. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of ASBs commitments. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016 02 on January 1, 2019, which had a material effect on its balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 due to the recognition of lease liabilities and right of use assets. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRecent accounting pronouncementsLeases, of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off balance sheet arrangements. Although the Company and the Utilities have off balance sheet arrangements, management has determined that it has no off balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Companys and the Utilities financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors, including the following types of off balance sheet arrangements:1.obligations under guarantee contracts,2.retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets,3.obligations under derivative instruments, and4.obligations under a material variable interest held by the Company or the Utilities in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company or the Utilities, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company or the Utilities.Material estimates and critical accounting policies. In preparing financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; electric utility unbilled revenues; allowance for loan losses; and fair value. Management considers an accounting estimate to be material if it 37requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the assumptions selected could have a material impact on the estimate and on the Companys results of operations or financial condition.In accordance with SEC Release No. 33 8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, management has identified the accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the Companys financial statements that is, management believes that the policies discussed below are both the most important to the portrayal of the Companys results of operations and financial condition, and currently require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The policies affecting both of the Companys two principal segments are discussed below and the policies affecting just one segment are discussed in the respective segments section of Material estimates and critical accounting policies. Management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the HEI Audit Committee and, as applicable, the Hawaiian Electric Audit Committee.For additional discussion of the Companys accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for additional discussion of material estimates and critical accounting policies, see the electric utility and bank segment discussions below under the same heading.Pension and other postretirement benefits obligations. The Companys reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future experience. For example, retirement benefits costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age and compensation levels), the level of contributions to the plans, earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets, and changes made to the provisions of the plans. Costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including the expected return on plan assets, the discount rate and mortality. The Companys accounting for retirement benefits under the plans in which the employees of the Utilities participate is also adjusted to account for the impact of decisions by the PUC. Changes in obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants.Based on various assumptions in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, sensitivities of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) as of December 31, 2018, associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions, were as follows and constitute forward looking statements:Actuarial assumptionChange in assumptionin basis pointsImpact on HEI ConsolidatedPBO or APBO Impact on Consolidated Hawaiian ElectricPBO or APBO(dollars in millions) Pension benefits Discount rate+/ 50(147)/166 (137)/156Other benefits Discount rate+/ 50(12)/13 (11)/12Health care cost trend rate+/ 1003/(3) 3/(3)Also, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingencies and litigation. The Company is subject to proceedings (including PUC proceedings), lawsuits and other claims. Management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes of these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses, including costs of investigation. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual case or proceeding often with the assistance of outside counsel. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters, such as a change in settlement strategy.In general, environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense, unless it is probable that the PUC would allow such costs to be recovered through future rates, in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets. Also, environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life, increase the capacity, or improve the safety or efficiency of property; the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination; or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale.See Notes 3 and 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the Companys assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when such 38deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities. These potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes, regulations and rules. Management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience, previous actions by taxing authorities (e.g., actions taken in other jurisdictions) and advice from its tax advisors. Management believes that the Companys provision for tax contingencies is reasonable. However, the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the Companys current and deferred income tax amounts.See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Following are discussions of the electric utility and bank segments. Additional segment information is shown in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discussion concerning Hawaiian Electric should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.Electric utilityExecutive overview and strategy. The Utilities provide electricity on all the principal islands in the state, other than Kauai, to approximately 95% of the states population, and operate five separate grids. The Utilities mission is to provide innovative energy leadership for Hawaii, to meet the needs and expectations of customers and communities, and to empower them with affordable, reliable and clean energy. The goal is to create a modern, flexible, and dynamic electric grid that enables an optimal mix of distributed energy resources, such as private rooftop solar, demand response, and grid scale resources to enable the creation of smart, sustainable, resilient communities and achieve the statutory goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045.Transition to renewable energy. The Utilities are fully committed to a 100 percent renewable future for Hawaii and are partnering with the State of Hawaii in achieving its Renewable Portfolio Standard goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045. Hawaiis RPS law requires electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045, respectively. The regulatory framework includes a number of mechanisms designed to provide utility financial stability during the transition toward the states 100% renewable energy future. Under the sales decoupling mechanism, the utilities are allowed to recover from customers, target test year revenues, independent of the level of kWh sales, which have declined as privately owned distributed energy resources have been added to the grid and energy efficiency measures have been put into place. Other regulatory mechanisms reduce regulatory lag, such as the major project interim recovery mechanism, which allow the utilities to recover and earn on certain approved major capital projects placed into service in between rate cases. See Item 1. BusinessHEI Consolidated and Decoupling in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Utilities have made significant progress on the path to clean energy and have been successful in adding significant amounts of renewable energy resources to their electric systems and exceeded the 2015 RPS goal. The Utilities RPS for 2018 was approximately 27% and is on track to achieve the 2020 RPS goal of 30%. (See Developments in renewable energy efforts below). Also, compared to 2011, the Utilities have reduced the use of oil to produce electricity by 1.58 million barrels. The combination of replacing fossil fuel generation with renewables, customer conservation efforts, and energy efficiency actions has allowed the Utilities to achieve its 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 16% (compared to a 2010 baseline) ahead of schedule in 2014. As of the end of 2018, the Utilities have achieved a 18.9% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2010.Power Supply Improvement Plans and Integrated Grid Planning. The December 2016 PSIP Update Report accepted by the PUC in July 2017 includes the continued growth of private rooftop solar and describes the grid and generation modernization work needed to reliably integrate an estimated total of 165,000 private systems by 2030, and additional grid scale renewable energy resources. In addition, the plans forecast the addition of 360 MW of grid scale solar and 157 MW of grid scale wind, with 8 MW derived from the first phase of the community based renewable energy (CBRE) program. The plans also include 115 MW from Demand Response (DR) programs, which can shift customer use of electricity to times when more renewable energy is available, potentially increasing the capacity to add even more renewable resources. The December 2016 Update Report emphasizes work that is in progress or planned through 2021 on each of the five islands the Utilities serve.Achieving 100% renewable energy will require modernizing the grid through coordinated energy system planning in partnership with local communities and stakeholders. To accomplish this, the Utilities filed its Integrated Grid Planning (IGP) Report with the PUC on March 1, 2018, which provides an innovative systems approach to energy planning intended to yield the most cost effective renewable energy pathways that incorporates customer and stakeholder input. 39The PUC opened a docket for the IGP process that the Utilities had proposed. As required, the Utilities filed an IGP Work plan on December 14, 2018, describing the timing and scope of major activities that will occur in the IGP process.Demand response programs. Pursuant to PUC orders, the Utilities are developing an integrated DR Portfolio Plan that will enhance system operations and reduce costs to customers. The reduction in cost for the customer will take the form of either rates or incentive based programs that will compensate customers for their participation individually, or by way of engagements with turnkey service providers that contract with the Utilities to aggregate and deliver various grid services on behalf of participating customers and their distributed assets.In October 2017, the PUC approved the Utilities request made in December 2015 to defer and recover certain computer software and software development costs for a DR Management System in an amount not to exceed $3.9 million, exclusive of AFUDC, through the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program Surcharge. The Utilities placed the DR Management System in service in the first quarter of 2019. In 2019, the Utilities are expected to sign a number of multi year Grid Services Purchase Agreements with third party aggregators. These contracts pay service providers to aggregate grid supporting capabilities from customer sited Distributed Energy Resources. The first of these five year contracts in a not to exceed amount of $21 million has been executed and is expected to not only deliver benefit through efficient grid operations and avoided fuel costs over that 5 year period, but as the PUC considers Performance based Regulation, demonstrated savings resulting from these contracts could results in shared savings for the Utilities. This complements the Utilities transformation and supports customer choice.On January 25, 2018, the PUC approved the Utilities revised DR Portfolio tariff structure. The PUC supported the approach of working with aggregators to implement the DR portfolio, and ordered the Utilities to complete contracting by June 2018 and initiate first implementation by the third quarter of 2018. The Utilities have selected the aggregators and commenced negotiations in July 2018, with many technical requirements discussions held throughout 2018. The aggregator contracts will be finalized in the first quarter of 2019. Grid modernization. The overall goal of the Grid Modernization Strategy is to deploy modern grid investments at an appropriate priority, sequence and pace to cost effectively maximize flexibility, minimize the risk of redundancy and obsolescence, deliver customer benefits and enable greater DER and renewable energy integration. Under the Grid Modernization Strategy, new technology will help triple private rooftop solar and make use of rapidly evolving products including storage and advanced inverters. The Utilities have begun work to implement the Grid Modernization Strategy by issuing solicitations for advanced meters, a meter data management system, and a communications network. The Utilities filed an application with the PUC on June 21, 2018, for the first implementation phase, estimated to cost approximately $86 million and expected to be incurred over five years. Additional applications will be filed later to implement subsequent phases of the strategy.Community Based Renewable Energy. In December 2017, the PUC adopted a CBRE program framework which allows customers who cannot, or chose not to, take advantage of private rooftop solar to receive the benefits of renewable energy to help offset their monthly electric bills and support clean energy for Hawaii. The program has two phases.The first phase, which commenced in July 2018, totals 8 MW of solar PV only with one credit rate for each island. The Utilities role is limited to administrative only during the first phase. As administrators, the Utilities will work with subscriber organizations to allocate capacity, answer general program questions, verify subscriber eligibility and process bill credits for subscribers. The Utilities are in the process of verifying the projects and awarding the capacity to interested subscriber organizations. The response has been positive; four of the five islands that the Utilities serve have received applications that equal or exceed what is allowed in phase 1.The second phase will commence after review of the first full year of the first phase. The second phase is contemplated to be a larger capacity and include multiple credit rates (e.g., time of day) and various technologies. The Utilities will have the opportunity to develop self build projects; however 50% of utility capacity will be reserved for low to moderate income customers.Microgrid services tariff proceeding. On July 10, 2018, the PUC issued an order instituting a proceeding to investigate establishment of a microgrid services tariff, pursuant to Act 200 (July 10, 2018 Act). The PUC will issue subsequent order(s) establishing a statement of issues to be addressed in the order, and issue a procedural schedule to govern this proceeding, after the deadline for the filing of motions to intervene or participate.Decoupling. See Decoupling in Item 1. BusinessHEI Consolidation and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of decoupling.As part of decoupling, the Utilities also track their rate making ROACEs as calculated under the earnings sharing mechanism, which includes only items considered in establishing rates. At year end, each utilitys rate making ROACE is compared against its ROACE allowed by the PUC to determine whether earnings sharing has been triggered. Annual earnings 40of a utility over and above the ROACE allowed by the PUC are shared between the utility and its ratepayers on a tiered basis. Earnings sharing credits are included in the annual decoupling filing for the following year. Results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 did not trigger the earnings sharing mechanism for the Utilities.Regulated returns. Actual and PUC allowed returns, as of December 31, 2018, were as follows:% Rate making Return on rate base (RORB)* ROACE** Rate making ROACE***Year ended December 31, 2018 Hawaiian Electric Hawaii Electric Light Maui Electric Hawaiian Electric Hawaii Electric Light Maui Electric Hawaiian Electric Hawaii Electric Light Maui ElectricUtility returns 6.55 6.98 6.26 7.36 8.41 7.59 7.89 8.08 7.38PUC allowed returns 7.57 7.80 7.43 9.50 9.50 9.50 9.50 9.50 9.50Difference (1.02) (0.82) (1.17) (2.14) (1.09) (1.91) (1.61) (1.42) (2.12) * Based on recorded operating income and average rate base, both adjusted for items not included in determining electric rates.** Recorded net income divided by average common equity.*** ROACE adjusted to remove items not included by the PUC in establishing rates, such as incentive compensation.The gap between PUC allowed ROACEs and the ROACEs actually achieved is primarily due to: the consistent exclusion of certain expenses from rates (for example, incentive compensation and charitable contributions), the recognition of annual RAM revenues on June 1 annually rather than on January 1, the low RBA interest rate (currently a short term debt rate rather than the actual cost of capital), O&M increases and return on capital additions since the last rate case in excess of indexed escalations, and the first year averaging convention for MPIR investments for rate base purposes. 41Results of operations.2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 Increase (decrease) (dollars in millions, except per barrel amounts)$2,547 $2,258 $289 Revenues.

In addition, the rate was further lowered by certain adjustments made in conjunction with the filing of the Companys 2017 tax returns, including an increased pension deduction taken resulting in a net income tax benefit of $5.3 million associated with the rate differential. The lower tax rate was partially offset by other Tax Act changes, including the non deductibility of excess executive compensation and various fringe benefit costs.Hawaiian Electrics effective tax rate (combined federal and state income tax rates) was higher for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the impact of the 2017 adjustment to accumulated deferred income tax balances (exclusive of accumulated deferred income tax balances related to the regulated rate base of the Utilities) for the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%.43Most recent rate proceedings. Unless otherwise agreed or ordered, each electric utility is currently required by PUC order to initiate a rate proceeding every third year (on a staggered basis) to allow the PUC and the Consumer Advocate to regularly evaluate decoupling and to allow the utility to request electric rate increases to cover rising operating costs and the cost of plant and equipment, including the cost of new capital projects to maintain and improve service reliability and integrate more renewable energy. The PUC may grant an interim increase within 10 to 11 months following the filing of an application, but there is no guarantee of such an interim increase and interim amounts collected are refundable, with interest, to the extent they exceed the amount approved in the PUCs final D&O. The timing and amount of any final increase is determined at the discretion of the PUC. The adoption of revenue, expense, rate base and cost of capital amounts (including the ROACE and RORB) for purposes of an interim rate increase does not commit the PUC to accept any such amounts in its final D&O.In 2018, final D&Os were issued by the PUC for the Hawaiian Electric 2017 rate case and the Hawaii Electric Light 2016 rate case. Interim rates for Maui Electrics 2018 rate case were effective on August 23, 2018, with a final D&O pending. In December 2018, Hawaii Electric Light filed its 2019 rate case.Test year(dollars in millions) Date(filed/implemented) Amount % over rates in effect ROACE(%) RORB(%) Rate base Commonequity% Stipulated agreement reached withConsumerAdvocateHawaiian Electric 20171 Request 12/16/16 $106.4 6.9 10.60 8.28 $2,002 57.36 Yes Interim increase 2/16/18 36.0 2.3 9.50 7.57 1,980 57.10 Interim increase with Tax Act 4/13/18 (0.6) 9.50 7.57 1,993 57.10 Final increase 9/1/18 (0.6) 9.50 7.57 1,993 57.10 Hawaii Electric Light 20162 Request 9/19/16 $19.3 6.5 10.60 8.44 $479 57.12 YesInterim increase 8/31/17 9.9 3.4 9.50 7.80 482 56.69 Interim increase with Tax Act 5/1/18 1.5 0.5 9.50 7.80 481 56.69 Final increase 10/1/18 9.50 7.80 481 56.69 2019 Request 12/14/18 $13.4 3.4 10.50 8.30 $537 56.91 Maui Electric 2018 Request 10/12/17 $30.1 9.3 10.60 8.05 $473 56.94 YesInterim increase 8/23/18 12.5 3.82 9.50 7.43 462 57.02 Note: The Request date reflects the application filing date for the rate proceeding.

Generally, the lower corporate income tax rate lowers the Utilities revenue requirements through lower income tax expense and through the amortization of a regulatory liability for excess accumulated deferred income taxes (ADIT) resulting from the recording of ADIT in prior years at the higher income tax rate. The revenues collected in the first and a portion of the second quarters of 2018 reflected income taxes at the old 35% rate and consequently, the Utilities reduced revenues to the extent the income taxes collected in 2018 revenue exceeded the taxes accrued at the new 21% rate. This reduction was recorded to a regulatory liability and electric rates were adjusted in the second quarter to initiate the return of the 2018 excess to customers over various amortization periods. In addition, rates have been adjusted to begin returning the excess ADIT that was accumulated as of December 31, 2017. The Tax Act also excludes the Utilities asset additions from qualifying for bonus depreciation (other than certain grandfathered utility property), which has the offsetting effect of increasing revenue requirement by lowering ADIT and thereby increasing rate base on a prospective basis. 44Performance based regulation and ratemaking legislation. See Performance incentive mechanisms and Performance based regulation proceeding in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Depreciation docket. In December 2016, the Utilities filed an application with the PUC for approval of changes in the depreciation and amortization rates and amortization period for CIAC, based on a 2015 Book Depreciation Study. In July 2018, the PUC approved the stipulated agreement between the Utilities and the Consumer Advocate, which among other things: Authorized the use of consolidated depreciation and amortization rates rather than separate depreciation and amortization rates for the three utilitiesEstablished revised depreciation and amortization rates for the three utilities Approved the implementation of the new depreciation and amortization rates and other changes to coincide with the effective date of the interim or final base rates approved in the subsequent rate case for each utility, beginning with Maui Electrics ongoing 2018 test year rate caseDevelopments in renewable energy efforts. Developments in the Utilities efforts to further their renewable energy strategy include renewable energy projects discussed in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the following:New renewable PPAs.South Maui Renewable Resources (2.87 MW solar) reached commercial operations on May 5, 2018, and Kuia Solar (2.87 MW solar) reached commercial operations on October 4, 2018. Each projects PPA with Maui Electric was approved by the PUC in February 2016, subject to certain modifications and conditions.In December 2014, the PUC approved a PPA for Renewable As Available Energy dated October 3, 2013 between Hawaiian Electric and Na Pua Makani Power Partners, LLC (NPM) for a proposed 24 MW wind farm on Oahu. The NPM wind farm was expected to be placed into service by August 31, 2019, but has been delayed due to an appeal of the decision in the Habitat Conservation Permit contested case.In July 2017, the PUC approved, with certain modifications and conditions, three PPAs for solar energy on Oahu with Waipio PV, LLC for 45.9 MW, Lanikuhana Solar, LLC for 14.7 MW and Kawailoa Solar, LLC for 49.0 MW. The three projects are now owned by Clearway Energy Group LLC, which is an investment of Global Infrastructure Partners. The three projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2019.In July 2018, the PUC approved Maui Electrics PPA with Molokai New Energy Partners to purchase solar energy from a PV plus battery storage project. The 4.88 MW project will deliver no more than 2.64 MW at any time to the Molokai system and is expected to be in service by January 2020.Tariffed renewable resources.As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 461 MW, 98 MW and 108 MW of installed distributed renewable energy technologies (mainly PV) at Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, respectively, for tariff based private customer generation programs, namely Standard Interconnection Agreement, Net Energy Metering, Net Energy Metering Plus, Customer Grid Supply, Customer Self Supply, Customer Grid Supply Plus and Interim Smart Export. As of December 31, 2018, an estimated 28% of single family homes on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii and Maui have installed private rooftop solar systems, and approximately 17% of the Utilities total customers have solar systems. The Utilities began accepting energy from feed in tariff projects in 2011. As of December 31, 2018, there were 33 MW, 3 MW and 5 MW of installed feed in tariff capacity from renewable energy technologies at Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, respectively.Biofuel sources. In July 2018, the PUC approved Hawaiian Electrics 3 year biodiesel supply contract with Pacific Biodiesel Technologies, LLC (PBT) to supply 2 million to 4 million gallons of biodiesel at Hawaiian Electrics Schofield Generating Station and the Honolulu International Airport Emergency Power Facility (HIA Facility) and any other generating unit on Oahu, as necessary. The PBT contract became effective on November 1, 2018. Hawaiian Electric also has a spot buy contract with PBT to purchase additional quantities of biodiesel at or below the price of diesel. Some purchases of at parity biodiesel have been made under the spot purchase contract, which was recently extended through June 2019. 45Hawaiian Electric has a contingency supply contract with REG Marketing & Logistics Group, LLC to also supply biodiesel to any generating unit on Oahu in the event PBT is not able to supply necessary quantities. This contingency contract has been extended to November 2019, and will continue with no volume purchase requirements. Requests for renewable proposals, expressions of interest, and information.Under a request for proposal process governed by the PUC and monitored by independent observers, in February 2018, the Utilities issued RFPs for 220 MW of renewable generation on Oahu, 50 MW of renewable generation on Hawaii Island, and 60 MW of renewable generation on Maui. The Utilities selected a final award group for Hawaii Island in August 2018 and for Maui and Oahu in September 2018. The Utilities executed in December 2018, a total of seven renewable generation PPAs utilizing photovoltaic technology paired with a battery storage system, subject to PUC approval, as follows: Utilities Number of contracts Total photovoltaic size (MW) BESS Size (MW/MWh) Guaranteed commercial operation dates Contract term (years) Total projected annual payment (in millions)Hawaiian Electric 3 127 127 / 508 12/31/2021 20 $27.9Hawaii Electric Light 2 60 60 / 240 7/20/2021 & 6/30/2022 25 14.1Maui Electric 2 75 75 / 300 7/20/2021 & 6/30/2022 25 17.6Total 7 262 262 / 1048 $59.6The Utilities are requesting PUC approval to recover the total projected annual payment of $59.6 million through the PPAC to the extent such costs are not included in base rates.In October 2017, the Utilities filed a draft request for proposal with the PUC for 40 MW of firm renewable generation on Maui (Maui Firm RFP) to be in service by the end of 2022. The Utilities are currently working with the independent observer for the Maui Firm RFP to update and revise the draft Maui Firm RFP for filing with the PUC for approval.In January 2017, Hawaiian Electric issued requests for Onshore Wind Expression of Interest to developers that are capable of developing utility scale onshore wind projects that are eligible to capture the federal Investment Tax Credit for Large Wind on the island of Oahu. In October 2018, Hawaiian Electric entered into a power purchase agreement with Eurus for a 46.8 MW onshore wind project, subject to PUC approval.Legislation and regulation. Congress and the Hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Also see Environmental regulation in Note 3 and Recent tax developments in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Clean Water Act Section 316(b). On August 14, 2014, the EPA published in the Federal Register the final regulations required by section 316(b) of the CWA designed to protect aquatic organisms from adverse impacts associated with existing power plant cooling water intake structures. The regulations were effective October 14, 2014 and apply to the cooling water systems for the steam generating units at three of Hawaiian Electrics power plants on the island of Oahu. The regulations prescribe a process, including a number of required site specific studies, for states to develop facility specific entrainment and impingement controls to be incorporated in each facilitys National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. Hawaiian Electric submitted the final site specific studies to the DOH in December 2016 for the Honolulu and Waiau power plants and in September 2017 for the Kahe power plant. Hawaiian Electric will work with the DOH to identify the appropriate compliance methods for the 316(b) rule. Until new permits are issued by DOH, Hawaiian Electric is operating the facilities under administrative extensions under the prior permit. Final compliance costs may vary depending on the outcome of the final permit. Impact of lava flows. In May 2018, a lava eruption occurred within the Leilani Estates subdivision, located along the lower East Rift Zone of Kilauea Volcano in the Puna district on the island of Hawaii, and affected approximately 3,000 of the 86,000 Hawaii Electric Light customers. As of December 31, 2018, there was no active flow. The flow damaged some of Hawaii Electric Lights property in the affected area and also resulted in the shutdown of independent power producer PGVs facilities. Hawaii Electric Light continues to serve the load of Hawaii Island without capacity from PGV. Hawaii Electric Light and PGV are in discussions on the requirements for PGV to return to service, however, the Utilities expect to meet its 2020 RPS goals without the return of PGV to service. The financial impact to Hawaii Electric Light has not been material.46Liquidity and capital resources. As a result of the Tax Act, utility property is no longer eligible for bonus depreciation. Consequently, the initial cash requirement for future capital projects will generally increase approximately 10% because of the loss of the immediate tax benefit from bonus depreciation. Management believes that Hawaiian Electrics ability, and that of its subsidiaries, to generate cash, both internally from operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities and commercial paper and draws on lines of credit, is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund their respective capital expenditures, investments, debt repayments, retirement benefit plan contributions and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future.Hawaiian Electrics consolidated capital structure was as follows:December 312018 2017(dollars in millions) Short term borrowings$25 1% $5 %Long term debt, net1,419 41 1,369 42Preferred stock34 1 34 1Common stock equity1,958 57 1,845 57 $3,436 100% $3,253 100%Hawaiian Electrics commercial paper borrowings, borrowings from HEI, and line of credit facility were as follows: Year endedDecember 31, 2018 (in millions)Averagebalance End of periodbalance December 31,2017Short term borrowings1 Commercial paper$85 $ $5Line of credit draws Borrowings from HEI Undrawn capacity under line of credit facility 200 2001 The maximum amount of external short term borrowings by Hawaiian Electric during 2018 was $157 million. At December 31, 2018, Hawaiian Electric had no short term borrowings from Hawaii Electric Light or Maui Electric.Hawaiian Electric utilizes short term debt, typically commercial paper, to support normal operations, to refinance short term debt and for other temporary requirements. Hawaiian Electric also borrows short term from HEI for itself and on behalf of Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, and Hawaiian Electric may borrow from or loan to Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric on a short term basis. The intercompany borrowings among the Utilities, but not the borrowings from HEI, are eliminated in the consolidation of Hawaiian Electrics financial statements. The Utilities periodically utilize long term debt, borrowings of the proceeds of special purpose revenue bonds (SPRBs) issued by the Department of Budget and Finance of the State of Hawaii (DBF) and the issuance of privately placed unsecured senior notes bearing taxable interest, to finance the Utilities capital improvement projects, or to repay short term borrowings used to finance such projects. The PUC must approve issuances, if any, of equity and long term debt securities by the Utilities.Hawaiian Electric has a $200 million line of credit facility with no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2018. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of February 13, 2019, the Fitch, Moodys and S&P ratings of Hawaiian Electric were as follows: FitchMoodysS&PLong term issuer default, long term issuer and corporate credit, respectivelyBBB+Baa2BBB Commercial paperF2P 2A 3Senior unsecured debt/special purpose revenue bondsA Baa2BBB Hawaiian Electric obligated preferred securities of trust subsidiary*Baa3BBCumulative preferred stock (selected series)*Ba1*Subordinated debtBBB**OutlookStableStableStable* Not rated.The above ratings reflect only the view, at the time the ratings are issued or affirmed, of the applicable rating agency, from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.47SPRBs have been issued by the DBF to finance (and refinance) capital improvement projects of Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries, but the sources of their repayment are the non collateralized obligations of Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries under loan agreements and notes issued to the DBF, including Hawaiian Electrics guarantees of its subsidiaries obligations. Upon PUC approval received in April 2018 (April 2018 Approval), on May 30, 2018, Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric issued through a private placement, $75 million, $15 million and $10 million, respectively, of unsecured senior notes bearing taxable interest. The April 2018 Approval also authorized the use of the expedited approval procedure to request for the remaining additional taxable debt to be issued during 2019 through 2021, with certain conditions, for up to $205 million and $15 million for Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light, respectively. Maui Electric does not have authorization to issue additional taxable debt beyond 2018. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.On February 26, 2019, the PUC approved Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Lights request to issue refunding special purpose revenue bonds (SPRBs) prior to December 31, 2020 to refinance their outstanding Series 2009 SPRBs in the amount of up to $90 million and $60 million, respectively.On October 26, 2018, the Utilities requested PUC approval to issue SPRBs in the amounts of up to $70 million, $2.5 million and $7.5 million for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, respectively, prior to June 30, 2020, to finance the Utilities capital improvement programs.On November 29, 2018, Hawaiian Electric entered into a 364 day, $50 million term loan credit agreement that matures on November 28, 2019. Hawaiian Electric drew the first $25 million on November 29, 2018 and the second $25 million on January 31, 2019. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 31, 2019, the Utilities received PUC approval to issue the remaining authorized amounts under the April 2018 Approval in 2019 through 2020 (Hawaiian Electric up to $205 million and Hawaii Electric Light up to $15 million of taxable debt), as well as a supplemental increase to authorize the issuance of additional taxable debt to finance capital expenditures, repay long term and or short term debt used to finance or refinance capital expenditures, and or to reimburse funds used for payment of capital expenditures, and to refinance the Utilities 2004 junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures prior to maturity. In addition, the Utilities received approval to extend the period to issue additional taxable debt from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The new total up to amounts of taxable debt requested to be issued through December 31, 2022 are $410 million, $150 million and $130 million for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, respectively.On October 22, 2018, the Utilities received PUC approval for the supplemental increase to issue and sell additional common stock in the amounts of up to $280 million for Hawaiian Electric and up to $100 million each for Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, with the new total up to amounts of $430 million for Hawaiian Electric and $110 million each for Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, and to extend the period authorized by the PUC to issue and sell common stock from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. In December 2018, Hawaiian Electric sold $70.7 million of its common stock to HEI and Maui Electric sold $1.5 million of its common stock to Hawaiian Electric. Hawaii Electric Light did not issue common stock in 2018. Cash flows.

For the five year period 2019 through 2023, the Utilities forecast up to $2.2 billion of net capital expenditures, which could change over time based upon external factors such as the timing and scope of environmental regulations, unforeseen delays in permitting and timing of PUC decisions. Proceeds from the issuance of equity and long term debt, cash flows from operating activities, temporary increases in short term borrowings and existing cash and cash equivalents are expected to provide the funds needed for the net capital expenditures, to pay down commercial paper or other short term borrowings, as well as to fund any unanticipated expenditures not included in the 2019 to 2023 forecast (such as increases in the costs or acceleration of capital projects, or unanticipated capital expenditures that may be required by new environmental laws and regulations).Management periodically reviews capital expenditure estimates and the timing of construction projects. These estimates may change significantly as a result of many considerations, including changes in economic conditions, changes in forecasts of kWh sales and peak load, the availability of purchased power and changes in expectations concerning the construction and ownership of future generation units, the availability of generating sites and transmission and distribution corridors, the need for fuel infrastructure investments, the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate increases, escalation in construction costs, the effects of opposition to proposed construction projects and requirements of environmental and other regulatory and permitting authorities.Selected contractual obligations and commitments. The following table presents aggregated information about total payments due from the Utilities during the indicated periods under the specified contractual obligations and commitments:December 31, 2018Payments due by period(in millions)Less than 1 year 1 3years 3 5years More than 5 years Total Short term borrowings$25 $ $ $ $25Long term debt 96 152 1,179 1,427Interest on long term debt68 128 125 761 1,082Operating leases6 11 4 3 24Open purchase order obligations 75 7 3 85Fuel oil purchase obligations (estimate based on December 31, 2018 fuel oil prices)140 16 156Purchase power obligations minimum fixed capacity charges119 195 118 279 711Liabilities for uncertain tax positions 2 2Total (estimated)$433 $455 $402 $2,222 $3,512 Includes contractual obligations and commitments for capital expenditures and expense amounts.The table above does not include other categories of obligations and commitments, such as deferred taxes, trade payables, amounts that will become payable in future periods under collective bargaining and other employment agreements and employee benefit plans and potential refunds of amounts collected from ratepayers (e.g., under the earnings sharing mechanism). As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of the Utilities retirement benefit plans did not exceed the retirement benefit plans benefit obligation. Minimum funding requirements for 49retirement benefit plans have not been included in the table above. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for retirement benefit plan obligations and estimated contributions for 2019.See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of fuel and power purchase commitments.Competition. Although competition in the generation sector in Hawaii is moderated by the scarcity of generation sites, various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities, the PUC has promoted a more competitive electric industry environment through its decisions concerning competitive bidding and distributed generation (DG). An increasing amount of generation is provided by IPPs and customer distributed generation.Competitive bidding. In December 2006, the PUC issued a decision that included a final competitive bidding framework, which became effective immediately. The final framework states, among other things, that: (1) a utility is required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource or a block of generation resources unless the PUC finds bidding to be unsuitable; (2) the framework does not apply in certain situations identified in the framework; (3) waivers from competitive bidding for certain circumstances will be considered; (4) the utility is required to select an independent observer from a list approved by the PUC whenever the utility or its affiliate seeks to advance a project proposal (i.e., in competition with those offered by bidders); (5) the utility may consider its own self bid proposals in response to generation needs identified in its RFP; and (6) for any resource to which competitive bidding does not apply (due to waiver or exemption), the utility retains its traditional obligation to offer to purchase capacity and energy from a Qualifying Facility (QF) at avoided cost upon reasonable terms and conditions approved by the PUC.Technological developments. New emerging and breakthrough technological developments (e.g., the commercial development of energy storage, grid support utility interactive inverters, fuel cells, DG, grid modernization, electrification of transportation, and generation from renewable sources) may impact the Utilities future competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Utilities continue to seek prudent opportunities to develop and implement advanced technologies that align with its technical and business plans.Environmental matters. See Electric utilityRegulationEnvironmental regulation under Item 1. Business and Environmental regulation in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Commitments and contingencies. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of important commitments and contingencies.Material estimates and critical accounting policies. Also see Material estimates and critical accounting policies for Consolidated HEI above.Property, plant and equipment. The Utilities believe that the PUC will allow recovery of property, plant and equipment in its electric rates. If the PUC does not allow recovery of any such costs, the electric utility would be required to write off the disallowed costs at that time. See the discussion under Utility projects in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements concerning costs of major projects that have not yet been approved for inclusion in the applicable utilitys rate base.Regulatory assets and liabilities. The Utilities are regulated by the PUC. In accordance with accounting standards for regulatory operations, the Companys and the Utilities financial statements reflect assets, liabilities, revenues and costs of the Utilities based on current cost based rate making regulations. The actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.Regulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred that are refundable to customers. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because their recovery in future customer rates is probable. As of December 31, 2018, the consolidated regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets of the Utilities amounted to $950 million and $833 million, respectively, compared to $881 million and $869 million as of December 31, 2017, respectively. Regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets are itemized in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment. Because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the Utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return, management believes that the recovery of the regulatory assets as of December 31, 2018 is probable. This determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in Hawaii and is subject to change in the future.Management believes that the operations of the Utilities currently satisfy the criteria for regulatory accounting. If events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities expect that their regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance, which may result in a material adverse effect on the Companys and the Utilities results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.50Revenues. Electric utility revenues are based on rates authorized by the PUC and include revenues applicable to estimated energy consumed in the accounting period, but not yet billed to customers (Unbilled revenues), and RBA revenues or refunds for the difference between PUC approved target revenues and recorded adjusted revenues, which delinks revenues from kWh sales. Unbilled revenues represent an estimate of energy consumed by customers subsequent to the date of the last meter reading to the end of the current reporting period. As of December 31, 2018, Unbilled revenues amounted to $122 million and the RBA revenues recognized in 2018 amounted to $46 million.The rate schedules of the Utilities include ECACs (replaced with ECRCs for Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light in 2019) under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power. The rate schedules of the Utilities also include PPACs under which electric rates are more closely aligned with purchase power costs incurred. If the ECAC/ECRCs, PPACs or RBAs were lost or adversely modified, it could result in a material adverse effect on the Companys and the Utilities results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Consolidation of variable interest entities. A business enterprise must evaluate whether it should consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE). The Utilities evaluate the impact of applying accounting standards for consolidation to its relationships with IPPs with whom the Utilities execute new PPAs or execute amendments of existing PPAs. A possible outcome of the analysis is that Hawaiian Electric or its subsidiaries may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of a VIE, which finding may result in the consolidation of the IPP in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidation of IPPs could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities, and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. The Utilities do not know how the consolidation of IPPs would be treated for regulatory or credit ratings purposes. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.51BankExecutive overview and strategy. ASB, headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers. ASB is one of the largest financial institutions in Hawaii and ended 2018 with assets of $7.0 billion and net income of $83 million, compared to assets of $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 and net income of $67 million in 2017.ASB provides a wide range of financial products and services, and in order to remain competitive and continue building core franchise value, ASB is focused on deepening customer relationships and developing and introducing new products and services in order to meet market needs. Additionally, the banking industry is constantly changing and ASB is making the investments in people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive, facilitate process improvements in order to deliver a continuously better experience for its customers, and be a more efficient bank. ASBs continued focus has been on efficient growth to maximize profitability and capital efficiency, as well as control expenses. Key strategies to drive organic growth include:1.deepening customer relationships;2.building out product and service offerings to open new segments;3.fully deploying online and remotely assisted account opening capabilities; and4.prioritizing efficiency actions to gain earnings leverage on organic growth.The interest rate environment and the quality of ASBs assets will continue to influence its financial results. A flattened yield curve as a result of an increase in short term interest rates and excess liquidity in the financial system have made it challenging to grow the banks loan portfolio and find investments with adequate risk adjusted returns. The potential for compression of ASBs margin when interest rates rise is a risk that is actively managed.As part of its interest rate risk management process, ASB uses simulation analysis to measure net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates (see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk). ASB then employs strategies to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. ASBs key strategies to manage interest rate risk include:1.attracting and retaining low cost deposits, particularly those in non interest bearing transaction accounts;2.diversifying the loan portfolio with higher spread, shorter maturity loans and or variable rate loans;3.focusing investment growth in securities that exhibit less extension risk (i.e., risk of longer average lives) as rates rise.ASBs loan quality benefited in 2018 from increasing property values, more financial flexibility of borrowers, and overall general economic improvement in the state of Hawaii. ASBs net charge offs as a percentage of total average loans was 0.34% for 2018 compared to 0.27% for 2017. The higher net charge off ratio was primarily due to charge offs of consumer loans. ASBs provision for loan losses increased from $10.9 million for 2017 to $14.7 million for 2018, primarily due to additional reserves for the consumer loan portfolio, partly offset by lower reserves required for the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios as a result of improved credit quality in those loan portfolios.52Results of operations.2018 vs. 2017(in millions) 2018 2017 Increase(decrease) Primary reason(s)Interest income $258 $236 $22 Higher interest income was due to higher average earning asset balances and an increase in yields on earning assets. ASBs average investment and mortgage backed securities portfolio balance for 2018 increased by $240 million compared to the average balance in 2017 as ASB purchased investments with liquidity not used to fund the loan portfolio. The average loan portfolio balance for 2018 was $54 million higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in the average HELOC, residential and consumer loan portfolio balances of $55 million, $45 million and $35 million, respectively. The growth in these loan portfolios was consistent with ASBs portfolio mix targets and loan growth strategy. The average commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio balances decreased by $51 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily due to ASBs strategic decision to reduce the balances in certain commercial and national loan portfolios to improve credit quality in those portfolios. The yield on earning assets increased 18 basis points as the increase in short term interest rates during the year repriced the adjustable rate loans upward and increased the yields for the investment securities.Noninterest income 56 62 (6) Noninterest income was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to lower fees from other financial services as a result of debit card interchange expenses being netted against income beginning in 2018. Prior years debit card interchange expenses were recorded in other noninterest expense. This change was in accordance with the new revenue recognition accounting standard. See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the new revenue recognition standard. ASB also had lower fee income on deposit products and mortgage banking income. The lower mortgage banking income was due to lower residential loan production and ASBs decision to portfolio a larger portion of the residential loan production.Revenues 314 298 16 The increase in revenues was due to higher interest income, partly offset by lower noninterest income. Interest expense 15 12 3 Higher interest expense was due to an increase in term certificate balances and increased rates for term certificates, money market accounts and repurchase agreements, partly offset by the payoff of a matured FHLB advance. Average deposit balances for 2018 increased by $342 million compared to 2017 due to an increase in core deposits and time certificates of $249 million and $93 million, respectively. The other borrowings average balance decreased by $36 million primarily due to the payoff of a matured FHLB advance.Provision for loan losses 15 11 4 The provision for loan losses for 2018 was primarily due to an increase in reserves for the consumer loan portfolio as a result of growth and increased net charge offs. The provision for loan losses benefited from the release of reserves in the commercial, commercial real estate and HELOC loan portfolios as a result of improving credit trends. The provision for loan losses for 2017 was primarily due to an increase in reserves for the consumer loan portfolio as a result of growth and increased net charge offs. The commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios released reserves as a result of lower portfolio balances and improved credit trends.Noninterest expense 176 175 1 Higher noninterest expense was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefit costs partly offset by lower other noninterest expenses as a result of debit card interchange expenses for 2018 being netted against debit card interchange income within noninterest income.Expenses 206 198 8 The increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in interest expense and higher provision for loan losses.Operating income 108 100 8 Higher interest income was partly offset by lower noninterest income, higher provision for loan losses, higher interest expense and higher noninterest expenses.Net income 83 67 16 The increase in net income was the result of higher operating income and lower income tax expense due to the Tax Act.Return on average equity 1 13.5% 11.2% 2.3% 532017 vs. 2016(in millions) 2017 2016 Increase(decrease) Primary reason(s)Interest income $236 $219 $17 Higher interest income was due to higher average earning asset balances and an increase in yields on earning assets. ASBs average investment and mortgage backed securities portfolio balance for 2017 increased by $345 million compared to the average balance in 2016 as ASB purchased investments with liquidity not used to fund the loan portfolio. The average loan portfolio balance for 2017 was $11 million lower than 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the average commercial loan portfolio balance of $112 million. The decrease was due to the strategic reduction of the national syndicated lending portfolio ($88 million decrease in average balance) and paydowns in the commercial portfolio. The average consumer, HELOC and commercial real estate loan balances increased by $56 million, $29 million and $15 million, respectively. The growth in these loan portfolios was consistent with ASBs portfolio mix targets and loan growth strategy. The yield on earning assets increased 8 basis points as the increase in short term interest rates during the year repriced the adjustable rate loans upward and increased the yields for the investment securities.Noninterest income 62 67 (5) Noninterest income was lower due to a decrease in mortgage banking income and lower fee income from other financial products. The lower mortgage banking income was due to lower residential loan production and ASBs decision to portfolio a larger portion of the residential loan production.Revenues 298 286 12 The increase in revenues was due to higher interest income, partly offset by lower noninterest income.Interest expense 12 13 (1) Lower interest expense was due to the payoff of a maturing other borrowing, partly offset by higher interest expense from an increase in average interest bearing liabilities. Average deposit balances for 2017 increased by $451 million compared to 2016 due to an increase in core deposits and time certificates of $319 million and $132 million, respectively. The other borrowings average balance decreased by $94 million primarily due to a decrease in repurchase agreements.Provision for loan losses 11 17 (6) Lower provision for loan losses for 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in reserves for the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios as a result of lower portfolio balances and improving credit trends, partly offset by increased provision for loan losses for the consumer loan portfolio as a result of growth and increased charge offs. The provision for loan losses in 2016 was used primarily to establish loan loss reserves for the growth in the commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios and additional reserve levels for specific commercial credits.Noninterest expense 175 168 7 Higher noninterest expense was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefit costs.Expenses 198 198 Expenses were flat as higher noninterest expense was offset by lower interest expense and provision for loan losses.Operating income 100 88 12 Higher interest income and lower provision for loan losses, partly offset by lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expenses.Net income 67 57 10 The increase in net income was the result of higher operating income and lower income tax expense due to the Tax Act.Return on average equity 1 11.2% 9.9% 1.3% 1 Calculated using the average daily balances.See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of guarantees and further information about ASB.54Average balance sheet and net interest margin.

Earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on costing liabilities. The interest rate environment has been impacted by disruptions in the financial markets over a period of several years. These conditions have begun to moderate with the interest rate increases in the past year resulting in an increase in ASBs net interest income and net interest margin.Loan originations and mortgage backed securities are ASBs primary earning assets.Loan portfolio. ASBs loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates, competition, demand for financing, availability of funds and managements responses to these factors.

The decrease in the commercial loan portfolio was primarily due to the strategic reductions in the portfolio, including a $75 million reduction in ASBs nationally syndicated loan portfolio. The decrease in the commercial real estate loan portfolio was primarily due to paydown of a large commercial real estate credit. The growth in the residential 1 4 family, HELOC and consumer loan portfolios were consistent with ASBs loan growth strategy.The increase in the loans balance in 2016 was primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate, consumer, commercial construction and HELOC loan portfolios as a result of demand for these loan types, partly offset by a decrease in the commercial and residential 1 4 family loan portfolios. The growth in the commercial real estate, consumer, commercial construction and HELOC loan portfolios was consistent with ASBs loan growth strategy. The decrease in the commercial loan portfolio was due to the strategic reduction of ASBs nationally syndicated loan portfolio by $93 million. The decrease in the residential loan portfolio was due to ASBs decision to sell a portion of its loan production with low interest rates to control its interest rate risk.The increase in the loans balance in 2015 was primarily due to growth in commercial real estate, HELOC and residential 1 4 family loan portfolios, partly offset by a decrease in the commercial loan portfolio. The growth in the commercial real estate, HELOC and residential loan portfolios was driven by demand for this loan type and was consistent with ASBs loan growth strategy.57The following table summarizes loans held for investment based upon contractually scheduled principal payments allocated to the indicated maturity categories: December 312018DueIn1 yearor less After 1 yearthrough5 years After5 years Total(in millions) Commercial Fixed$66 $111 $23 $200Commercial Adjustable157 213 18 388Total commercial 223 324 41 588Commercial construction Fixed Commercial construction Adjustable28 26 38 92Total commercial construction28 26 38 92Residential construction Fixed14 14Residential construction Adjustable Total residential construction14 14Total loans Fixed80 111 23 214Total loans Adjustable185 239 56 480Total loans$265 $350 $79 $694Home equity key credit statistics. Attention has been given by regulators and rating agencies to the potential for increased exposure to credit losses associated with HELOCs that were originated during the period of rapid home price appreciation between 2003 and 2007 as they have reached the end of their 10 year, interest only payment periods. Once the interest only payment period has ended, payments are reset to include principal repayments along with interest. ASB does not have a large exposure to HELOCs originated between 2003 and 2007. Nearly all of ASBs HELOC originations prior to 2008 consisted of amortizing equity lines that have structured principal payments during the draw period. These older equity lines represent 2% of the HELOC portfolio and are included in the amortizing balances identified in the loan portfolio table below.December 31 2018 2017Outstanding balance of home equity loans (in thousands) $978,237 $913,052Percent of portfolio in first lien position 49.2% 48.0 %Net charge off (recovery) ratio 0.01% (0.03)%Delinquency ratio 0.46% 0.28 % End of draw period interest only CurrentDecember 31, 2018 Total Interest only 2019 2020 2021 2023 Thereafter amortizingOutstanding balance (in thousands) $978,237 $740,431 $38,912 $133,819 $567,700 $237,806% of total 100% 76% 4% 14% 58% 24% The HELOC portfolio makes up 20% of the total loan portfolio and is generally an interest only revolving loan for a 10 year period, after which time the HELOC outstanding balance converts to a fully amortizing variable rate term loan with a 20 year amortization period. This product type comprises 76% of the total HELOC portfolio and is the current product offering. Borrowers also have a Fixed Rate Loan Option to convert a part of their available line of credit into a 5, 7 or 10 year fully amortizing fixed rate loan with level principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 22% of the portfolio balances were amortizing loans under the Fixed Rate Loan Option. Loan portfolio risk elements. When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency promptly, the loan is classified as delinquent. If delinquencies are not cured promptly, ASB normally commences a collection action, including foreclosure proceedings in the case of real estate secured loans. In a foreclosure action, the property collateralizing the delinquent debt is sold at a public auction in which ASB may participate as a bidder to protect its interest. If ASB is the successful bidder, the property is classified as real estate owned until it is sold. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, ASB had $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of real estate acquired in settlement of loans.In addition to delinquent loans, other significant lending risk elements include: (1) loans which accrue interest and are 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest, (2) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis (nonaccrual loans), and (3) loans on which various concessions are made with respect to interest rate, maturity, or other terms due to the inability of the borrower 58to service the obligation under the original terms of the agreement (troubled debt restructured loans). ASB loans that were 90 days or more past due on which interest was being accrued as of December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were immaterial or nil.

ASB evaluates a restructured loan transaction to determine if the borrower is in financial difficulty and if the restructured terms are considered concessionstypically terms that are out of market, beyond normal or reasonable standards, or otherwise not available to a non troubled borrower in the normal marketplace. A loan classified as TDR must meet both criteria of financial difficulty and concession. Accruing TDR loans increased by $5.1 million primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in HELOC loans classified as TDR.In 2017, nonaccrual loans increased slightly by $0.3 million primarily due to higher nonaccrual residential 1 4 family, HELOC and consumer loans of $1.4 million, $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Nonaccrual commercial loans decreased by $3.6 million. Accruing TDR loans decreased by $16.8 million in 2017 primarily due to decreases of $12.4 million, $3.5 million, and $2.3 million of commercial, residential 1 4 family, and residential land loans, respectively, classified as TDRs.In 2016, nonaccrual loans decreased $22.7 million primarily due to upgrades of specific commercial and commercial real estate loans, payoff of a troubled commercial loan and a segment of residential mortgages transferred to held for sale. Nonaccrual commercial and residential loans decreased by $13.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively. Accruing TDR loans increased $15.4 million in 2016 primarily due to increases of $13.0 million and $2.5 million of commercial and HELOC loans, respectively, classified as TDR. The increase in commercial loans classified as TDR was primarily due to two commercial credits being classified as TDR.In 2015, nonaccrual loans increased $9.1 million primarily due to higher nonaccrual commercial loans of $10.1 million. TDR loans decreased $1.9 million in 2015 primarily due to decreases of $2.4 million and $1.9 million of residential land and commercial loans, respectively, classified as TDR. HELOC loans classified as TDR increased by $2.0 million.59Impact of nonperforming loans on interest income.

Total delinquencies of $26.0 million at December 31, 2018 was an increase of $2.4 million compared to total delinquencies of $23.6 million at December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in delinquent consumer, HELOC and residential 1 4 family loans, partly offset by decreases in delinquent commercial loans. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans increased slightly from 0.51% of total outstanding loans at December 31, 2017 to 0.54% of total outstanding loans at December 31, 2018. Net charge offs for 2018 were $16.3 million, an increase of $3.5 million compared to $12.8 million at December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in consumer loan portfolio charge offs as a result of ASBs strategic expansion of its unsecured consumer loan portfolio product offering with risk based pricing. ASBs provision for loan losses was $14.7 million, an increase of $3.8 million compared to the provision for loan losses of $10.9 million for 2017. The increase was due to additional reserves for the consumer loan portfolio, partly offset by lower reserves required for the commercial, commercial construction, commercial real estate and HELOC loan portfolios as result of improved credit quality in those loan portfolios.In 2017, ASBs allowance for loan losses decreased by $1.9 million primarily due to lower loan loss reserves required for the commercial, commercial construction, and commercial real estate loan portfolios as a result of a decrease in the portfolio balances and improving credit trends, partly offset by additional loan loss reserves for the consumer and HELOC loan portfolios. Total delinquencies of $23.6 million at December 31, 2017 was a slight increase of $0.5 million compared to total delinquencies of $23.1 million at December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in delinquent commercial and consumer loans, offset by decreases in delinquent residential 1 4 family and commercial real estate loans. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans increased slightly from 0.49% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016 to 0.51% of total loans outstanding at 61December 31, 2017. Net charge offs for 2017 were $12.8 million, an increase of $1.5 million compared to $11.3 million for 2016 primarily due to an increase in consumer loan portfolio charge offs as a result of the strategic expansion of ASBs unsecured consumer loan product offering with risk based pricing. ASBs provision for loan losses was $10.9 million, a decrease of $5.9 million compared to the provision for loan losses of $16.8 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the release of reserves for commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios due to lower outstanding balances and improved credit quality, partly offset by an increase in loss reserves for the consumer loan portfolio.In 2016, ASBs allowance for loan losses increased by $5.5 million primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios and increases in reserves for the commercial real estate and unsecured consumer loan portfolios. Total delinquencies of $23.1 million at December 31, 2016 was $3.0 million lower than total delinquencies of $26.1 million at December 31, 2015 primarily due to the movement of $6 million of residential loans to held for sale. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans decreased from 0.57% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2015 to 0.49% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016. Net charge offs for 2016 were $11.3 million, an increase of $9.4 million compared to $1.9 million for 2015 primarily due to charge offs of specific commercial loans and an increase in consumer loan charge offs as a result of the strategic expansion of ASBs unsecured consumer loan product offering with risk based pricing. ASBs provision for loan losses was $16.8 million for 2016, an increase of $10.5 million compared to the provision for loan losses of $6.3 million for 2015. The increase in provision for loan losses was driven by growth in the commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios as well as specific reserves for a few commercial loans.In 2015, ASBs allowance for loan losses increased by $4.4 million primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate loan portfolio ($159 million or 29.8% growth in outstanding balances) and increases in reserves for commercial loans. Overall loan quality remained strong as total delinquencies of $26.1 million at December 31, 2015 was a slight increase of $0.6 million compared to total delinquencies of $25.5 million at December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in delinquent consumer loans. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans decreased slightly from 0.58% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2014 to 0.57% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2015. Net charge offs for 2015 were $1.9 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to $0.6 million for 2014 primarily due to an increase in consumer loan charge offs as result of the strategic expansion of ASBs unsecured consumer loan product offering with risk based pricing. ASBs provision for loan losses was $6.3 million for 2015, an increase of $0.2 million compared to the provision for loan losses of $6.1 million for 2014.Investment securities. ASBs investment portfolio was comprised as follows:December 31 2018 2017 2016(dollars in thousands) Balance % of total Balance % of total Balance % of totalU.S. Treasury and federal agency obligations $154,349 10% $184,298 13% $192,281 18%Mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies 1,303,291 85 1,245,988 86 897,474 81Corporate bonds 49,132 3 Mortgage revenue bonds 23,636 2 15,427 1 15,427 1Total investment securities $1,530,408 100% $1,445,713 100% $1,105,182 100% Currently, ASBs investment portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury and federal agency obligations, mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds and mortgage revenue bonds. ASB owns mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government agencies or sponsored agencies, including the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and Small Business Administration (SBA). The weighted average yield on investments during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 2.41%, 2.18% and 1.99%, respectively. ASB did not maintain a portfolio of securities held for trading during 2018, 2017 and 2016.As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, ASB had $141.9 million and $44.5 million, respectively, of investment securities that were purchased and classified as held to maturity. There were no investment securities classified as held to maturity as of December 31, 2016. The investment securities were classified as held to maturity to enhance the banks capital management in a rising rate environment. ASB considers the held to maturity classification of these investment securities to be appropriate as ASB has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.Principal and interest on mortgage backed securities issued by FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and SBA are guaranteed by the issuer and, in the case of GNMA and SBA, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. U.S. Treasury securities are also backed by the full faith of the U.S. government. The increase in investment securities was due to the purchase of agency mortgage backed and credit securities, corporate bonds, and a mortgage revenue bond with excess liquidity.The net unrealized losses on ASBs investment securities were primarily caused by movements in interest rates. All contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. Based upon ASBs evaluation at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 there was no indicated impairment as ASB expects to collect the contractual cash flows 62for these investments. See Investment securities in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of securities impairment assessment.As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, ASB did not have any private issue mortgage backed securities. ASB does not have any exposure to securities backed by subprime mortgages. See Investment securities in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of other than temporarily impaired securities.The following table summarizes the current amortized cost of ASBs investment portfolio (excluding stock of the FHLB of Des Moines, which has no contractual maturity) and weighted average yields as of December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, ASBs stock in FHLB of Des Moines ($10 million, $10 million and $11 million, respectively) was carried at cost because it can only be redeemed at par. The amount that ASB is required to invest in FHLB stock is determined by FHLB requirements. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, ASB received cash dividends of $350,000, $208,000 and $191,000, respectively, on its FHLB Stock.Deposits and other borrowings. As of December 31, 2018 ASBs costing liabilities consisted of 98% deposits and 2% other borrowings, compared to costing liabilities of 97% deposits and 3% other borrowings as of December 31, 2017.ASBs deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Hawaii. Net deposit inflow or outflow, measured as the year over year difference in year end deposits, was an inflow of $268 million in 2018, compared to an inflow of $342 million in 2017 and $524 million in 2016.The following table presents the average deposits and average rates by type of deposit.

See Other borrowings in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASB may obtain advances from the FHLB of Des Moines provided that certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are collateralized by a blanket pledge of certain notes held by ASB and the mortgages securing them. To the extent that advances exceed the amount of mortgage loan collateral pledged to the FHLB of Des Moines, the excess must be covered by qualified marketable securities held under the control of and at the FHLB of Des Moines or at an approved third party custodian. FHLB advances generally are available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts, to expand lending and to assist in the effort to improve asset and liability management. FHLB advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs offered from time to time by the FHLB of Des Moines. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as financing transactions and the obligations to repurchase these securities are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. ASB pledges investment securities as collateral for securities sold under agreements to repurchase. All such agreements are subject to master netting arrangements, which provide for conditional right of set off in case of default by either party; however, ASB presents securities sold under agreements to repurchase on a gross basis in the balance sheet.The decrease in other borrowings in 2018 was due to the payoff of a maturing FHLB advance and a decrease in business repurchase agreements.The decrease in other borrowings in 2017 was due to the payoff of a maturing FHLB advance, offset by an increase in business repurchase agreements. The decrease in other borrowings in 2016 was due to a decrease in public and business repurchase agreements and the maturity of a repurchase agreement with a broker/dealer. As of December 31, 2018, the unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Des Moines was $2.0 billion. The FHLB of Des Moines continues to be an important source of liquidity for ASB.Other factors. Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations and also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASBs investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of the investment securities, respectively. In addition, changes in credit spreads also impact the fair values of the investment securities.As of December 31, 2018, ASB had an unrealized loss, net of taxes, on available for sale investment securities (including securities pledged for repurchase agreements) in AOCI of $24.4 million compared to an unrealized loss, net of taxes, of $15.0 million as of December 31, 2017. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Legislation and regulation. ASB is subject to extensive regulation, principally by the OCC and the FDIC. Depending on ASBs level of regulatory capital and other considerations, these regulations could restrict the ability of ASB to compete with other institutions and to pay dividends to its shareholder. See the discussion below under Liquidity and capital resources. Also see Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Assessment in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act). Regulation of the financial services industry, including regulation of HEI, ASB Hawaii and ASB, has changed and will continue to change as a result of the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act, which became law in July 2010. Importantly for HEI, ASB Hawaii and ASB, under the Dodd Frank Act all of the functions of the OTS transferred on July 21, 2011 to the OCC, the FDIC, the FRB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau). Supervision and regulation of HEI and ASB Hawaii, as thrift holding companies, moved to the FRB, and supervision and regulation of ASB, as a federally chartered savings bank, moved to the OCC. While the laws and regulations applicable to HEI and ASB did not generally change, the applicable laws and regulations are being interpreted, and new and amended regulations may be adopted, by the FRB, the OCC and the Bureau. In addition, HEI will continue to be required to serve as a source of strength to ASB in the event of its financial distress. The Dodd Frank Act also imposed new restrictions on the ability of a savings bank to pay dividends should it fail to remain a qualified thrift lender. At all times during 2018, ASB was a qualified thrift lender.64ASB may also be subject to new state regulation because of a provision in the Dodd Frank Act that acknowledges that a federal savings bank may be subject to state regulation and allows federal law to preempt a state consumer financial law on a case by case basis only when (1) the state law would have a discriminatory effect on the bank compared to that on a bank chartered in that state, (2) the state law prevents or significantly interferes with a banks exercise of its power or (3) the state law is preempted by another federal law.Final Capital Rules. On July 2, 2013, the FRB finalized its rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The final rule would apply to banking organizations of all sizes and types regulated by the FRB and the OCC, except bank holding companies subject to the FRBs Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and Savings & Loan Holding Companies (SLHCs) substantially engaged in insurance underwriting or commercial activities. HEI currently meets the requirements of the exemption as a top tier grandfathered unitary SLHC that derived, as of June 30 of the previous calendar year, either 50% or more of its total consolidated assets or 50% or more of its total revenues on an enterprise wide basis (calculated under GAAP) from activities that are not financial in nature pursuant to Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act. The FRB is temporarily excluding these SLHCs from the final rule while it considers a proposal relating to capital and other requirements for SLHC intermediate holding companies (such as ASB Hawaii). The FRB indicated that it would release a proposal on intermediate holding companies that would specify the criteria for establishing and transferring activities to intermediate holding companies and propose to apply the FRBs capital requirements to such intermediate holding companies. The FRB has not yet issued such a proposal, or a proposal on how to apply the Basel III capital rules to SLHCs that are substantially engaged in commercial or insurance underwriting activities, such as grandfathered unitary SLHCs like HEI.Pursuant to the final rule and consistent with the proposals, all banking organizations, including covered holding companies, would initially be subject to the following minimum regulatory capital requirements: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%, a total capital ratio of 8% of risk weighted assets and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, and these requirements would increase in subsequent years. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, the final rule requires a banking organization to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk weighted assets (capital conservation buffer). In addition, a countercyclical capital buffer would expand the capital conservation buffer by up to 2.5% of a banking organizations total risk weighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations. The final rule would establish qualification criteria for common equity, additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments that help to ensure their ability to absorb losses. All banking organizations would be required to calculate risk weighted assets under the standardized approach, which harmonizes the banking agencies calculation of risk weighted assets and addresses shortcomings in capital requirements identified by the agencies. The phased in effective dates of the capital requirements under the final rule are:Minimum Capital RequirementsEffective dates 1/1/2015 1/1/2016 1/1/2017 1/1/2018 1/1/2019Capital conservation buffer 0.625% 1.25% 1.875% 2.50%Common equity Tier 1 ratio + conservation buffer 4.50% 5.125% 5.75% 6.375% 7.00%Tier 1 capital ratio + conservation buffer 6.00% 6.625% 7.25% 7.875% 8.50%Total capital ratio + conservation buffer 8.00% 8.625% 9.25% 9.875% 10.50%Tier 1 leverage ratio 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% 4.00%Countercyclical capital buffer not applicable to ASB 0.625% 1.25% 1.875% 2.50%The final rule was effective January 1, 2015 for ASB. As of December 31, 2018, ASB met the new capital requirements with a Common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.8%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8%, a Total capital ratio of 13.9% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.7%.Subject to the timing and final outcome of the FRBs SLHC intermediate holding company proposal, HEI anticipates that the capital requirements in the final rule will eventually be effective for HEI or ASB Hawaii as well. If the fully phased in capital requirements were currently applicable to HEI, management believes HEI would satisfy the capital requirements, including the fully phased in capital conservation buffer. Management cannot predict what final rule the FRB may adopt concerning intermediate holding companies or their impact on ASB Hawaii, if any.65Liquidity and capital resources.December 312018 % change 2017 % change(dollars in millions) Total assets$7,028 3 $6,799 6Investment securities1,530 6 1,446 31Loans held for investment, net4,791 4 4,617 (1)Deposit liabilities6,159 5 5,891 6Other bank borrowings110 (42) 191 (1)As of December 31, 2018, ASB was one of Hawaiis largest financial institutions based on assets of $7.0 billion and deposits of $6.2 billion. ASBs principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits, borrowings and the maturity and repayment of portfolio loans and securities. ASBs deposits as of December 31, 2018 were $268 million higher than December 31, 2017. ASBs principal sources of borrowings are advances from the FHLB and securities sold under agreements to repurchase from broker/dealers and commercial account holders. As of December 31, 2018, FHLB borrowings totaled $45 million, representing 0.6% of assets. ASB is approved to borrow from the FHLB up to 35% of ASBs assets to the extent it provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient FHLB stock. As of December 31, 2018, ASBs unused FHLB borrowing capacity was approximately $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2018, securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $65 million, representing 0.9% of assets. ASB utilizes deposits, advances from the FHLB and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund maturing and withdrawn deposits, repay maturing borrowings, fund existing and future loans and purchase investment and mortgage backed securities. As of December 31, 2018, ASB had commitments to borrowers for loans and unused lines and letters of credit of $1.9 billion, of which, commitments to lend to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings were nil. Management believes ASBs current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels.As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, ASB had $27.3 million and $23.6 million of loans on nonaccrual status, respectively, or 0.6% and 0.5% of net loans outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, ASB had $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of real estate acquired in settlement of loans.In 2018, operating activities provided cash of $123 million. Net cash of $368 million was used by investing activities primarily due to purchases of available for sale investment securities of $224 million, net increase in loans receivable of $189 million, purchases of held to maturity investment securities of $103 million, capital expenditures of $73 million and contributions to low income housing investments of $14 million, partly offset by receipt of repayments from available for sale investment securities of $219 million, proceeds from the sale of commercial loans of $7 million, repayments from held to maturity investment securities of $6 million and proceeds from the redemption of bank owned life insurance of $3 million. Financing activities provided net cash of $137 million primarily due to a net increase in deposits of $166 million, proceeds from FHLB advances of $696 million and a net increase in retail repurchase agreements of $27 million, partly offset by principal payments on FHLB advances of $701 million and common stock dividends to HEI (through ASB Hawaii) of $50 million.ASB believes that maintaining a satisfactory regulatory capital position provides a basis for public confidence, affords protection to depositors, helps to ensure continued access to capital markets on favorable terms and provides a foundation for growth. FDIC regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are not well capitalized to compete on the same terms as well capitalized institutions, such as by offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions. As of December 31, 2018, ASB was well capitalized (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for ASBs capital ratios).For a discussion of ASB dividends, see Common stock equity in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.See Commitments and Contingency in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements.Material estimates and critical accounting policies. Also see Material estimates and critical accounting policies for Consolidated HEI above.Allowance for loan losses. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion above under Earning assets, costing liabilities and other factors. ASB maintains an allowance for loan losses believed to be adequate to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio. The level of allowance for loan losses is based on a continuing assessment of existing risks in the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, changes in collateral values and current conditions (for example, economic 66conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment). The allowance for loan losses is allocated to loan types using both a formula based approach applied to groups of loans and an analysis of certain individual loans for impairment. The formula based approach emphasizes loss factors primarily derived from actual historical default and loss rates, which are combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine the allowance amounts allocated to the various loan categories. Adverse changes in any of these factors could result in higher charge offs and provision for loan losses.ASB disaggregates the loan portfolio into loan segments for purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses. Commercial, commercial real estate, and commercial construction loans are defined as non homogeneous loans. ASB utilizes a risk rating system for evaluating the credit quality of such loans. Loans are rated based on the degree of risk at origination and periodically thereafter, as appropriate. Values are applied separately to the probability of default (borrower risk) and loss given default (transaction risk). ASB utilizes a numerical based, risk rating PD Model that takes into consideration fiscal year end financial information of the borrower and identified financial attributes including retained earnings, operating cash flows, interest coverage, liquidity and leverage that demonstrate a strong correlation with default to assign default probabilities at the borrower level. In addition, a loss given default value is assigned to each loan to measure loss in the event of default based on loan specific features such as collateral that mitigates the amount of loss in the event of default. Together the PD Model and loss given default construct provide a quantitative, data driven and consistent framework for measuring risk within the portfolio, on a loan by loan basis and for the ultimate collectability of each loan.Residential, consumer and credit scored business loans are considered homogeneous loans, which are typically underwritten based on common, uniform standards. For the homogeneous portfolio, the quality of the loan is best indicated by the repayment performance of an individual borrower. ASB supplements performance data with external credit bureau data and credit scores such as the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score on a quarterly basis. ASB has built portfolio loss models for each major segment based on the combination of internal and external data to predict the probability of default at the loan level.ASB also considers qualitative factors in determining the allowance for loan losses. These include but are not limited to adjustments for changes in policies and procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and any concentrations of credit. The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, as discussed above. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.Management believes its allowance for loan losses adequately estimates actual loan losses that will ultimately be incurred. However, such estimates are based on currently available information and historical experience, and future adjustments may be required from time to time to the allowance for loan losses based on new information and changes that occur (e.g., due to changes in economic conditions, particularly in Hawaii). Actual losses could differ from managements estimates, and these differences and subsequent adjustments could be material.Fair value. Fair value estimates are based on the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid upon the transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value estimates are generally determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are based on market data obtained from independent third party sources. However, in certain cases, ASB uses its own assumptions based on the best information available in certain circumstances. These valuations are estimates at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information, information about the financial instrument and judgments regarding future expected loss experience, economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result if ASB were to sell its entire holdings of a particular financial instrument at one time. Because no active trading market exists for a portion of its financial instruments, fair value estimates cannot be determined with precision. Changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the estimates. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses could have a significant effect on fair value estimates, but have not been considered in making such estimates.ASB classifies its financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in accordance with the three level valuation hierarchy. Level 1 valuations are based on quoted prices, unadjusted for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or model based techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 valuations are based on model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in 67the market or significant management judgment or estimation. See Fair value measurements in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements).Significant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include ASBs mortgage backed securities available for sale. These instruments are priced using an external pricing service and are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The third party pricing services use a variety of methods to determine fair value including quoted prices for similar securities in an active market, yield spreads for similar trades, adjustments for liquidity, size, collateral characteristics, historic and generic prepayment speeds and other observable market factors. To enhance the robustness of the pricing process, ASB compares its standard third party vendors price with that of another third party vendor. If the prices are within an acceptable tolerance range, the price of the standard vendor will be accepted. If the variance is beyond the tolerance range, an evaluation will be conducted by the investment manager and a challenge to the price may be made. Fair value in such cases will be based on the value that best reflects the data and observable characteristics of the security. In all cases, the fair value used will have been independently determined by a third party pricing vendor or non affiliated broker.Fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. Examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method, loan impairments for certain loans, real estate acquired in settlement of loans and goodwill.See Investment securities and Derivative financial instruments in Note 4 and Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding ASBs fair value measurements.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKHEI and Hawaiian Electric (in the case of Hawaiian Electric, only the information related to Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries is applicable):The Company manages various market risks in the ordinary course of business, including credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company believes the electric utility and the other segments exposures to these two risks were not material as of December 31, 2018.Credit risk for ASB is the risk that borrowers or issuers of securities will not be able to repay their obligations to the bank. Credit risk associated with ASBs lending portfolios is controlled through its underwriting standards, loan rating of commercial and commercial real estate loans, on going monitoring by loan officers, credit review and quality control functions in these lending areas and adequate allowance for loan losses. Credit risk associated with the securities portfolio is mitigated through investment portfolio limits, experienced staff working with analytical tools, monthly fair value analysis and on going monitoring and reporting such as investment watch reports and loss sensitivity analysis. See Allowance for loan losses above and in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity risk for ASB is the risk that the bank will not meet its obligations when they become due. Liquidity risk is mitigated by ASBs asset/liability management process, on going analytical analysis, monitoring and reporting information such as weekly cash flow analyses and maintenance of liquidity contingency plans.The Utilities are exposed to some commodity price risk primarily related to their fuel supply and IPP contracts. The Utilities commodity price risk is substantially mitigated so long as they have their current ECAC/ECRCs in their rate schedules. The Utilities currently have no hedges against its commodity price risk. The Company currently has no direct exposure to market risk from trading activities nor foreign currency exchange rate risk.The Company considers interest rate risk to be a very significant market risk as it could potentially have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, especially as it relates to ASB, but also as it may affect the discount rate used to determine retirement benefit liabilities, the market value of retirement benefit plans assets and the Utilities allowed rates of return. Interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the Companys earnings to adverse movements in interest rates.Bank interest rate riskThe Companys success is dependent, in part, upon ASBs ability to manage interest rate risk (IRR). ASBs interest rate risk profile is strongly influenced by its primary business of making fixed rate residential mortgage loans and taking in retail deposits. Large mismatches in the amounts or timing between the maturity or repricing of interest sensitive assets or liabilities could adversely affect ASBs earnings and the market value of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of 68significant changes in the level of interest rates. Many other factors also affect ASBs exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences and competition for loans or deposits.ASBs Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO), whose voting members are officers and employees of ASB, is responsible for managing interest rate risk and carrying out the overall asset/liability management objectives and activities of ASB as approved by the ASB Board Risk Committee. ALCO establishes policies under which management monitors and coordinates ASBs assets and liabilities.See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the use of rate lock commitments on loans held for sale and forward sale contracts to manage some interest rate risk associated with ASBs residential loan sale program.Management of ASB measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis with an emphasis on measuring changes in net interest income (NII) and the market value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments. The simulation analysis is performed using a dedicated asset/liability management software system enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database. The simulation software is capable of generating scenario specific cash flows for all instruments using the specified contractual information for each instrument and product specific prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities.NII sensitivity analysis measures the change in ASBs twelve month, pretax NII in alternate interest rate scenarios. NII sensitivity is measured as the change in NII in the alternate interest rate scenarios as a percentage of the base case NII. The base case interest rate scenario is established using the current yield curve and assumes interest rates remain constant over the next twelve months. The alternate scenarios are created by assuming rate ramps or gradual interest changes and accomplished by moving the yield curve in a parallel fashion, over the next twelve month period, in increments of +/ 100 basis points. The simulation model forecasts scenario specific principal and interest cash flows for the interest bearing assets and liabilities, and the NII is calculated for each scenario. Key balance sheet modeling assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis include: the size of the balance sheet remains relatively constant over the simulation horizon and maturing assets or liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments in order to maintain the current mix of the balance sheet. In addition, assumptions are made about the prepayment behavior of mortgage backed assets, future pricing spreads for new assets and liabilities and the speed and magnitude with which deposit rates change in response to changes in the overall level of interest rates. Other NII sensitivity analysis may include scenarios such as yield curve twists or non static balance sheet changes (such as changes to key balance sheet drivers).Consistent with OCC guidelines, the market value or economic capitalization of ASB is measured as economic value of equity (EVE). EVE represents the theoretical market value of ASBs net worth and is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts. Key assumptions used in the calculation of ASBs EVE include the prepayment behavior of loans and investments, the possible distribution of future interest rates, pricing spreads for assets and liabilities in the alternate scenarios and the rate and balance behavior of deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities. EVE is calculated in multiple scenarios. As with the NII simulation, the base case is represented by the current yield curve. Alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of +/ 100 basis points (bp) up to + 300 bp. The change in EVE is measured as the change in EVE in a given rate scenario from the base case and expressed as a percentage. To gain further insight into the IRR profile, additional analysis is periodically performed in alternate scenarios including rate shifts of greater magnitude and changes in key balance sheet drivers.ASBs interest rate risk sensitivity measures as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 constitute forward looking statements and were as follows: Change in NII(gradual change in interest rates) Change in EVE(instantaneous change in interest rates)Change in interest rates(basis points) December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017+300 2.5% 3.0% 10.0% (8.0)%+200 1.9 2.4 8.1 (4.0)+100 1.1 1.6 5.1 (0.6) 100 (2.3) (2.7) (11.0) (6.0)The NII profile under the rising interest rate scenarios was less asset sensitive for all rate increases as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. NII asset sensitivity has been slowly decreasing as rising rates have slowed prepayment expectations, reducing the amount of the fixed rate mortgage and mortgage backed investment portfolios available to reprice in rising rate scenarios. In addition, the fixed rate portion of the HELOC portfolio grew, further reducing the amount available to reprice in rising rate scenarios.69ASBs base EVE increased to $1.49 billion as of December 31, 2018 compared to $1.18 billion as of December 31, 2017, due to the growth and mix of the balance sheet and longer duration of core deposits. Growth in the investment and loan portfolios was funded primarily with core deposits.In the third quarter of 2018, ASBs biennial core deposit study was conducted by a third party as part of its regular process. As a result of the study, the duration of ASBs core deposits extended compared to ASBs core deposit duration at December 31, 2017. This had the effect of improving our base EVE and increasing EVE sensitivity.EVE sensitivity shifted from liability to asset sensitive as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to core deposit study enhancements leading to a higher retention rate and longer duration. The extension of core deposit duration provides greater capacity for hedging long duration assets. Although market rate increases have been slowing prepayments and extending duration in the residential loan and mortgage backed investment portfolios, the longer duration of core deposits mitigates this exposure.The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the NII sensitivity and the percentage change in EVE is based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments, balance changes and pricing strategies, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. To the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis, actual results may differ materially from the simulation results. Furthermore, NII sensitivity analysis measures the change in ASBs twelve month, pretax NII in alternate interest rate scenarios, and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in ASBs current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk. The simulation does not contemplate any actions that ASB management might undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Further, the changes in NII vary in the twelve month simulation period and are not necessarily evenly distributed over the period. These analyses are for analytical purposes only and do not represent managements views of future market movements, the level of future earnings, or the timing of any changes in earnings within the twelve month analysis horizon. The actual impact of changes in interest rates on NII will depend on the magnitude and speed with which rates change, actual changes in ASBs balance sheet, and managements responses to the changes in interest rates.Other than bank interest rate riskThe Companys general policy is to manage other than bank interest rate risk through use of a combination of short term debt, long term debt and preferred securities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was exposed to other than bank interest rate risk because of its periodic borrowing requirements, the impact of interest rates on the discount rate and the market value of plan assets used to determine retirement benefits expenses and obligations (see Pension and other postretirement benefits obligations in HEIs MD&A and Retirement benefits in Notes 1 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities allowed rates of return. Other than these exposures, management believes its exposure to other than bank interest rate risk is not material. The Companys long term debt, in the form of borrowings of proceeds of revenue bonds, privately placed senior notes and bank term loans, is at fixed rates (see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value of long term debt, net other than bank).70
