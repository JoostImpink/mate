Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data above and with the financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 17 Table of Contents Overview We are a leading developer and operator of fixed site laser vision correction centers at our LasikPlus vision centers. Our vision centers provide the staff, facilities, equipment and support services for performing laser vision correction that employ advanced laser technologies to help correct nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. We currently use fixed site excimer lasers manufactured by Bausch Lomb, Advanced Medical Optics and Alcon. Our vision centers are supported mainly by independent, board certified ophthalmologists and credentialed optometrists, as well as other health care professionals. The ophthalmologists perform the laser vision correction procedures in our vision centers, and either ophthalmologists or optometrists conduct pre procedure evaluations and post procedure follow ups in our vision centers. The majority of our revenues currently are derived from LASIK laser vision correction procedures performed in our U.S. vision centers. Our operating costs and expenses include: Medical professional and license fees, including per procedure fees for the ophthalmologists performing laser vision correction and the license fees per procedure paid to equipment suppliers Advanced Medical Optics, Bausch Lomb and Alcon Direct costs of services, including vision center rent and utilities, equipment lease and maintenance costs, surgical supplies, center staff expense, financing charges and costs related to other revenues General and administrative costs, including headquarters staff expense and other overhead costs Marketing and advertising costs Depreciation of equipment Results of Operations Revenues We derived all of our revenues for the last three years from the delivery of laser vision correction services performed in our U.S. vision centers. Our revenues are primarily a function of the number of laser vision correction procedures performed and the pricing for these services. Our vision centers have a relatively high degree of operating leverage due to the fact that many of our costs are fixed in nature. As a result, our level of procedure volume can have a significant impact on our level of profitability. Our revenues are impacted by a number of factors, including the following: Our ability to generate customers through our arrangements with managed care companies, direct to consumer advertising and word of mouth referrals Our mix of procedures among the different types of laser technology New vision center openings and our ability to increase procedure volume at existing vision centers The availability of patient financing General economic conditions and consumer confidence levels The continued growth and increased acceptance of laser vision correction The effect of competition and discounting practices in our industry Certain states prohibit us from practicing medicine, employing ophthalmologists to practice medicine on our behalf or employing optometrists to render optometry services on our behalf. In those states, we may contract with professional corporations to provide these services. We currently own a non controlling interest in Lasik M.D. Toronto. Prior to the third quarter of 2005, financial results for our Canadian joint venture were consolidated into our financial statements. During the third quarter of 2005, we transferred financial and operational control of the joint venture to our partners in Toronto. Therefore, effective July 1, 2005, we began to account for the results of the Canadian venture using the equity method. 18 Table of Contents The following table details the number of laser vision correction procedures performed at our consolidated vision centers during the last three fiscal years. 2006 2005 2004 First Quarter 53,372 37,578 24,270 Second Quarter 47,308 36,010 24,093 Third Quarter 42,539 34,187 23,248 Fourth Quarter 42,049 34,225 24,224 Year 185,268 142,000 95,835 In 2006, revenues increased by $64,530,000, or 33.5%, to $256,927,000 from $192,397,000 in 2005. Approximately $58,624,000 of this increase in revenues in 2006 was a result of higher procedure volumes and approximately $5,906,000 was a result of improved pricing. For vision centers open at least 12 months, revenues increased by 17.7% in 2006 compared to 2005. Procedure volume of 185,268 increased 30.5% from 142,000 in 2005. Revenue per procedure of $1,387 increased about 2% from $1,355 in 2005. Increased marketing expenditures coupled with new centers drove market share increases in 2006. In 2005, revenues increased by $65,235,000 or 51.3%, to $192,397,000 from $127,122,000 in 2004. Approximately $61,237,000 of this increase in revenues in 2005 was a result of higher procedure volumes and approximately $4,038,000 was a result of improved pricing. Continued improvement in marketing and advertising effectiveness and continued growth and increased patient acceptance of laser vision correction, together with third party financing and our own patient financing plan, among other factors, helped to grow procedure volume in 2005 over 2004. Our strongest quarter in terms of number of procedures performed historically has been the first quarter of the year. We believe this is related to a number of factors, including the availability of funds under typical employer medical flexible spending programs and the general effect of the New Year season. The historic seasonality of our business was in part offset in 2005 by opening vision centers throughout the year. Operating Costs and Expenses 2006 Compared to 2005 The following table shows the increase in components of operating expenses from 2005 to 2006 in dollars and as a percent of revenues for each period (dollars in thousands): % of Revenue 2006 2005 Increase 2006 2005 Medical professional and license fees $ 44,754 $ 35,051 $ 9,703 17.4 % 18.2 % Direct costs of services 77,612 54,952 22,660 30.2 28.6 General and administrative expenses 21,156 14,021 7,135 8.2 7.3 Marketing and advertising 47,971 31,813 16,158 18.7 16.5 Depreciation and amortization 8,453 7,636 817 3.3 4.0 Medical professional expenses increased by approximately $5,869,000, or 27%, in 2006 from 2005 as a result of increased revenues from higher procedure volumes. License fees increased by $3,834,000, or 18%, primarily as a result of higher procedure volume. Direct costs of services include the salary component of physician compensation for certain physicians employed by us, staffing, equipment, medical supplies, finance charges and facility costs of operating laser vision correction centers. These direct costs increased in 2006 by $22,660,000, or 41%, compared to 2005. Of this amount, $19,669,000 was primarily a result of increased salaries, fringe benefits, rent and utilities, financing fees, insurance, laser rent and surgical supplies in connection with an increase in the number of vision centers and our higher procedure volumes. The recording of stock based compensation expense (SFAS 123(R)) resulted in expense of $2,991,000 in 2006. General and administrative expenses increased by $7,135,000, or 51%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. Of this amount, $4,461,000 was primarily due to increase in salaries, fringe benefits, contractual professional services and director fees. The recording of stock based compensation expense (SFAS 123(R)) resulted in $2,674,000 expense in 2006. Marketing and advertising expenses increased by $16,158,000, or 51%, in 2006 from 2005, primarily as a result of our efforts to support new markets and existing markets. The marketing and advertising expense increased more than the increase in revenue in 2006. The company is adjusting its marketing strategies with the goal of improving the marketing effectiveness. Depreciation expense increased by $817,000 in 2006 from 2005, primarily as a result of depreciation of capitalized expenditures at new vision centers in 2006. Net investment income increased by $2,253,000, or 57%, in 2006 from 2005, due to income on patient financing, higher levels of investments and higher interest rates. 19 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 The following table shows the increase in components of operating expenses from 2004 to 2005 in dollars and as a percent of revenues for each period (dollars in thousands): % of Revenue 2005 2004 Increase 2005 2004 Medical professional and license fees $ 35,051 $ 24,275 $ 10,776 18.2 % 19.1 % Direct costs of services 54,952 40,842 14,110 28.6 32.1 General and administrative expenses 14,021 10,292 3,729 7.3 8.1 Marketing and advertising 31,813 20,468 11,345 16.5 16.1 Depreciation and amortization 7,636 7,045 591 4.0 5.5 Medical professional expenses increased by approximately $6,700,000 in 2005 from 2004 as a result of increased revenues from higher procedure volumes. License fees increased by $4,076,000, primarily as a result of higher procedure volume. Direct costs of services include the salary component of physician compensation for certain physicians employed by us, staffing, equipment, medical supplies, finance charges and facility costs of operating laser vision correction centers. These direct costs increased in 2005 by $14,110,000 compared to 2004. This increase was largely due to salaries and benefits, financing fees related to third party patient financing, surgical supplies, laser rent and maintenance contracts, and rent and utilities. General and administrative expenses increased by $3,729,000 in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily as a result of increased salaries and benefits, professional services, telecommunications and travel. Marketing and advertising expenses increased by $11,345,000 in 2005 from 2004, primarily as a result of our efforts to support new markets and help to grow volume in existing markets. Depreciation expense increased by $591,000 in 2005 from 2004, primarily as a result of opening 10 new vision centers in 2005. Interest and dividend income increased by $1,872,000 in 2005 from 2004, due to income on long term receivables, higher levels of invested cash and higher interest rates. Income Taxes The following table summarizes the components of income tax provision for 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands of dollars): 2006 2005 2004 Federal income taxes $ 21,393 $ 16,882 $ 8,409 State and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 4,193 3,753 1,740 Foreign income taxes 496 621 Valuation allowance (decrease) (16,399 ) Income tax provision $ 25,586 $ 21,131 $ (5,629 ) See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $98,052,000 as of December 31, 2006, down from $110,531,000 at December 31, 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was $53,532,000. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaled $5,528,000. Net investment in securities was made in the amount of $70,930,000. Repurchase of shares for treasury stock amounted to $51,816,000. During the second quarter of 2006, the Company, with guidance from the Board of Directors, adopted a new investment policy for the companys liquid assets. The objectives of the policy are to maintain adequate liquidity, to provide safety of principal, to 20 Table of Contents maximize the after tax rate of return, and to maintain a well diversified portfolio. This policy places limitations on maturity, acceptable credit ratings, authorized securities, and credit concentration. Our contractual obligations for future cash payments as of December 31, 2006 are summarized in the following table. Payments due by Period More than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Capital Leases $ 6,205,000 $ 3,668,000 $ 2,537,000 $ $ Operating Lease Obligations 24,913,000 6,187,000 10,502,000 5,623,000 2,601,000 Deferred Compensation 4,136,000 4,136,000 Total $ 35,254,000 $ 9,855,000 $ 13,039,000 $ 5,623,000 $ 6,737,000 As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $1,954,000 and $5,200,000, respectively. These expire in varying amounts from 2017 until 2022. Our costs associated with the opening of a new vision center generally consist of capital expenditures such as the purchase or lease of lasers, diagnostic equipment, office equipment and leasehold improvements. In addition, we typically incur other startup expenses and pre opening advertising expenses. Generally, we estimate the costs associated with opening a new vision center to be between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. Actual costs vary from vision center to vision center based upon the location of the market, the number of lasers purchased or leased for the vision center, the site of the vision center, the cost of grand opening marketing and the level of leasehold improvements required. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of investments incurred in connection with the opening of new vision centers and equipment purchases or upgrades at existing facilities. The following is a list of the new vision centers we opened in the last two fiscal years: 2006 2005 Paramus, NJ Sacramento, CA Grand Rapids, MI Norfolk, VA Seattle, WA Hartford, CT Sugar Land, TX Milwaukee, WI Denver, CO Phoenix, AZ New Haven, CT Austin, TX Dallas, TX Portland, OR Oakdale, MN Pittsburgh, PA Lexington, KY Albuquerque, NM Lincoln Park, IL Birmingham, AL Laser and equipment upgrades and vision center expansions resulted in capital expenditures of $9,656,000 in 2006 and $10,748,000 in 2005, which were funded by cash flow from operations in both years. We continue to offer our own sponsored patient financing. As of December 31, 2006, we had $14,300,000 in accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, which is an increase of $2,700,000, or 23.0%, since December 31, 2005, compared to growth in revenue of 33.5%. Other assets include $500,000 of cash maintained by our consolidated captive insurance company pursuant to statutory requirements as of December 31, 2006. These funds are not available for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash flow from operations, available cash and short term investments provide sufficient cash reserves and liquidity to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures and capital lease obligations. Critical Accounting Estimates Accounts Receivable We provide patient financing to some of our customers, including those who could not otherwise obtain third party financing. The terms of the financing require the patient to pay an up front fee and the remainder is deducted over a period of 12 to 36 months. Accounts receivable for patients that we finance for a period of 12 months or less are recorded at the undiscounted total expected payments less an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts. For patients we finance with an initial term over 12 months, we record the present value of expected payments. The discount rate assumption is based upon current market rates charged by other providers of unsecured credit to similar customers. Interest income is recorded over the term of the payment program. As of December 31, 2006, the discount in receivables with an initial term over 12 months was $117,000. 21 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts As a result of an expansion of the amount of patient financing provided in 2006, we are exposed to more credit risk than we have experienced in the past. Based upon our own experience with patient financing and based upon the credit experience of lenders that provide financing to customers similar to ours, we have established allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2006 of $2,842,000 against accounts receivable of $17,176,000, compared to an allowance of $3,145,000 against accounts receivable of $14,797,000 at December 31, 2005. Our policy is to reserve for all receivables that remain open past financial maturity date and to provide reserves for receivables prior to the maturity date to bring receivables net of reserves down to the estimated net realizable value based on historical collectibility rates. To the extent that our actual allowance for doubtful account writeoffs are greater than our estimated bad debt reserve, it would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that our actual allowance for doubtful accounts write offs are less than our estimated bad debt reserve, it would favorably impact our results of operations and cash flows. Captive Insurance Company Reserves Effective December 18, 2002, we established a captive insurance company to provide professional liability insurance coverage for claims brought against us after December 17, 2002. In addition, our captive insurance companys charter allows it to provide professional liability insurance for our doctors, some of whom are currently insured by the captive. Our captive insurance company is managed by an independent insurance consulting and management firm, and it is capitalized and funded by us based on actuarial studies performed by an affiliate of the consulting and management firm. Beginning December 18, 2003, the Company elected to use the captive insurance company for both the primary insurance and the excess liability coverage. A number of claims are now pending with our captive insurance company. The financial statements of the captive insurance company are consolidated with our financial statements since it is a wholly owned enterprise. As of December 31, 2006, we recorded an insurance reserve amount of $6,163,000, which primarily represents an actuarially determined estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. This represents an increase in the reserve of $2,323,000 from $3,840,000 at December 31, 2005. To the extent that our actual claim experience is greater than our estimated insurance reserve, it would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that our actual claim experience is less than our estimated insurance reserve, it would favorably impact our results of operations and cash flows. Income Taxes At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had approximately $1,954,000 and $5,200,000, respectively, of net operating loss carryforwards that can be used to reduce future taxable income. The Company decreased the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in 2004 by $16,399,000. The reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was made because of continued profitability of the Company in 2004 and expected future profitability. We currently believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent of the tax benefit recorded. Consolidation We use the consolidation method to report our investment in majority owned subsidiaries and other companies that are not considered variable interest entities (VIEs) and in all VIEs for which we are considered the primary beneficiary. In addition, we consolidate the results of operations of professional corporations with which we contract to provide the services of ophthalmologists or optometrists at our vision centers in accordance with EITF 97 2, Application of FASB Statement 94 and APB Opinion No. 16 to Physician Management Entities and Certain Other Entities with Contractual Management Agreements. Investments in joint ventures and 20% to 50% owned affiliates where we have the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. 22 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period. SFAS No. 123(R) became effective for all stock based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006. In addition, companies must recognize compensation expense related to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date. Compensation expense for the unvested awards is measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123. The impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) decreased net income by $4,511,000 in 2006. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and prescribes a framework for recognizing and measuring income tax benefits for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties. FIN 48 provides that an income tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the benefit claimed or to be claimed on an income tax return will be sustained upon examination. The amount of income tax benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007 and are in the process of finalizing our assessment of uncertain tax positions based on current FASB guidance. We do not anticipate the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be material to our consolidate financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements since the FASB has previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. SFAS 157 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2008. We are currently in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The carrying values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Short term investments are recorded at market value. Due to the short term nature of the investment in corporate bonds and the significant portion of the investments in government bonds, there is little risk to the valuation. We have a low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, as such, have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk. 23 Table of Contents
