Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains trend analysis, estimates and other forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward looking statements include, without limitation, statements containing the words believes, anticipates, expects, continue, and other words of similar import or the negative of those terms or expressions. Such forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, estimates and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those set forth in such forward looking statements as a result of, but not limited to, the Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A. You should read the following discussion and analysis along with the Selected Financial Data and the financial statements and notes attached to those statements included elsewhere in this report. Overview We were incorporated in June 1995. From our inception through December 31, 2006, our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators. Our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger DNA binding proteins (ZFPs) for the regulation and modification of genes. We have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities, borrowings, payments from federal government research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners. As of December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of $128.3 million. Our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for ZFP TFs and ZFNs, contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones, and Federal government research grant funding. We expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner fundings will continue beyond their initial terms. In 2006, we have continued to place more emphasis on higher value therapeutic product development and related strategic partnerships and less emphasis on our Enabling Technology collaborations. We believe this shift in emphasis has the potential to increase the return on investment to our stockholders by allocating capital resources to higher value, therapeutic product development activities. At the same time, it may reduce our revenues over the next several years and subject to higher financial risk by increasing expenses associated with product development. We filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of a ZFP Therapeutic in patients with diabetic neuropathy during the fourth quarter of 2006. Development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the FDA. Our future products are gene based therapeutics. Adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval, the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses, stock based compensation expense, pre clinical and clinical studies, laboratory supplies, allocated facilities costs, subcontracted research expenses, and expenses for trademark registration and technology licenses. Research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred. Costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred. We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives. We expect these expenses will increase significantly as we focus increasingly on development of ZFP Therapeutics. Additionally, in order to develop ZFP TFs and ZFNs as commercially relevant therapeutics, we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing, regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, professional fees, patent prosecution expenses, allocated facilities costs and other general corporate expenses. As we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the Company to become more complex. We may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business. 36 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Sangamo believes the following critical accounting policies have significant effect in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, revenue from research activities made under strategic partnering agreements and Enabling Technology collaborations is recognized as the services are provided when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Amounts received in advance under such agreements are deferred until the above criteria are met and the research services are performed. Sangamos federal government research grants are typically multi year agreements and provide for the reimbursement of qualified expenses for research and development as defined under the terms of the grant agreement. Revenue under grant agreements is recognized when the related qualified research expenses are incurred. Grant reimbursements are typically received on a quarterly basis and are subject to the issuing agencys right of audit. Milestone payments under research, partnering, or licensing agreements are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon milestones, provided that (i) the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement, and (ii) there are no performance obligations associated with the milestone payment. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, revenue arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003, that include multiple deliverables, are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria, including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. In addition, the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values, and the applicable revenue recognition criterion is considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for our stock based employee compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), as allowed by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (SFAS No. 148). As a result, no expense was recognized for options to purchase our common stock that were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and no expense was recognized in connection with purchases under our employee stock purchase plan for the years ended December 31, 2005 or 2004. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005. Subsequent to the effective date, the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized includes: (a) compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 amortized on an accelerated basis over the options vesting period, and (b) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period. Results for prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, the net loss is greater by $1.98 million for year ended December 31, 2006 than had the Company continued to account for stock based employee compensation under APB No. 25. Basic and diluted net loss per share for year ended December 31, 2006 is $0.06 greater than if the Company had continued to account for stock based compensation under APB No. 25. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R had no impact on cash flows from operations or financing. On November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards. We have elected to adopt the 37 Table of Contents alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects (if any) of stock based compensation expense pursuant to SFAS 123R. The alterative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact to the APIC pool and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123R. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 Total Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % Change 2005 2004 Change % Change (In thousands, except percentage values) Revenues: Collaboration agreements $ 6,625 $ 1,832 $ 4,793 262 % $ 1,832 $ 947 $ 885 93 % Federal government research grants 1,260 652 608 93 % 652 368 284 77 % Total revenues $ 7,885 $ 2,484 $ 5,401 217 % $ 2,484 $ 1,315 $ 1,169 89 % We are increasing the emphasis of our research and development activities on ZFP Therapeutics. Even with this change in resource allocation, we anticipate increasing revenues over the next several years primarily related to our Research License and Commercial Option Agreement with Dow AgroSciences LLC (DAS), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Dow Chemical Corporation. Total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements, strategic partnerships and federal government research grants. Revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were $6.6 million in 2006, compared to $1.8 million in 2005, and $947,000 in 2004. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was principally attributable to increased revenues of approximately $4.6 million in connection with our Research License and Commercial Option Agreement with DAS and $235,000 in connection with our collaboration in the field of regenerative medicine with LifeScan. The increase in 2005 from 2004 was principally attributable to increased revenues of approximately $748,000 related to our research collaboration agreement with Pfizer, increased revenues of approximately $677,000 in connection with our Research License and Commercial Option Agreement with DAS, and increased revenues of approximately $280,000 in connection with our collaboration in the field of regenerative medicine with LifeScan. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of $615,000 from our therapeutics partnership with Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (Edwards), as well as lower revenues of approximately $100,000 associated with other Enabling Technology collaborations. The decreased revenue from Edwards is due to the submission of the first IND by Edwards for a licensed product under the agreement with Sangamo. Federal government research grant revenues were $1.3 million in 2006, $652,000 in 2005 and $368,000 in 2004. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily attributable to increased revenue of $456,000 in connection with our Advanced Technology Program grant awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, $176,000 in connection with our Cystic Fibrosis grant awarded by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and $100,000 in connection with our ZFN driven Gene Disruption of CCR5 as a Potential Treatment of AIDS grant awarded by the National Institutes of Health. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of $118,000 from our federal government grant associated with sickle cell. The increase in 2005 from 2004 was primarily attributable to increased revenue of $352,000 in connection with our Advanced Technology Program grant awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company concluded that, since the inception, revenues related to this grant had been under recorded by $254,000. A one time adjustment for this amount was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2005 and is the primary reason for the increased federal government research grant revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004. We plan to continue to apply for federal government research grants. 38 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % Change 2005 2004 Change % Change (In thousands, except percentage values) Operating expenses: Research and development $ 21,527 $ 10,909 $ 10,618 97 % $ 10,909 $ 11,184 $ (275 ) (2 )% General and administrative 7,087 5,323 1,764 33 % 5,323 4,781 542 11 % Total operating expenses $ 28,614 $ 16,232 $ 12,382 76 % $ 16,232 $ 15,965 $ 267 2 % Research and development expenses Research and development expenses have consisted primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses, stock based compensation expense, laboratory supplies, pre clinical and clinical studies, allocated facilities costs, subcontracted research expenses and expenses for trademark registration and technology licenses. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our ZFP Therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials. To the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials, increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided. Research and development expenses were $21.5 million in 2006, compared to $10.9 million in 2005 and $11.2 million in 2004. The increase of $10.6 million in 2006 from 2005 was principally due to increased expenses associated with the acquisition of all assets in Edwards ZFP therapeutic angiogenesis program valued at $5.8 million, $1.2 million of stock based compensation due to adoption of SFAS No. 123R, increased expenses for laboratory supplies of approximately $1.1 million, increased expenses associated with diabetic neuropathy related clinical studies of $1.1 million, increased expenses for salaries and related benefits of $963,000 due to increased headcount, increased consulting expenses of approximately $392,000 and increased expenses associated with pre clinical studies of $135,000. The decrease of $275,000 in 2005 from 2004 was principally due to decreased expenses related to research licenses, lower non employee stock based compensation expense of $349,000, decreased clinical related expenses of $288,000, primarily related to our diabetic neuropathy program, and decreased allocated facility expenses of $286,000. The decrease is partially offset increased expenses for laboratory supplies of approximately $466,000, increased external research expenses of approximately $406,000 and increased consulting expenses of approximately $209,000. Our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our ZFP TF technology for several potential applications. Among these are ZFP Therapeutics for cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, cancer and monogenic diseases, ZFP engineered cell lines, protein production and ZFP TFs and ZFNs for applications in agricultural biotechnology. Below is a summary of our programs partially funded by collaborators and the development phase of the leading application: Program Collaborator Stage ZFP technology to modify the genomes or alter the protein expression of plant cells, plants, or plant cell cultures Dow AgroSciences Research ZFP engineered cell lines for the manufacture of protein pharmaceuticals Pfizer Research/Marketing 39 Table of Contents Below is a summary of our programs funded internally and the development stage of the leading application: Internal Programs Program Stage ZFP Therapeutics Clinical/Preclinical/Research ZFP TF engineered cell lines for the manufacture of protein pharmaceuticals Research Due to the early stage of our various internal research and development projects, we do not track costs associated with its internal projects on a project by project basis. Drug development is inherently uncertain and the successful completion of our development programs is subject to numerous technological challenges and risks and we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our programs. Material cash inflows associated with the sale of products, if any, which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years. See Risk Factors Our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process, and if these potential products are not approved, we will not be able to commercialize these products and Our gene regulation technology is relatively new, and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications, it would limit our revenue opportunities. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, stock based compensation expenses, professional fees, allocated facilities costs, expenses for patent prosecution and other general corporate expenses. As we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads, we expect the business aspects of the Company to become more complex. We may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business. General and administrative expenses were $7.1 million during 2006, $5.3 million in 2005 and $4.8 million in 2004. The increase of $1.8 million in 2006 was principally due to increased professional services expenses of approximately $961,000, primarily patent prosecution related, and $787,000 related to stock based compensation due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The increase of $542,000 in 2005 was principally due to increased salary and benefit expenses of approximately $394,000 and increased professional services expenses of $299,000, primarily patent prosecution related. This increased was partially offset by decreasing corporate communication expenses of $108,000. Interest income, net Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % Change 2005 2004 Change % Change (In thousands, except percentage values) Interest income, net $ 2,411 $ 850 $ 1,561 184 % $ 850 $ 620 $ 230 37 % Net interest income was $2.4 million in 2006, as compared to $850,000 in 2005, and $620,000 in 2004. The increase of $1.6 million in 2006 from 2005 was primarily related to higher interest income earned on higher average cash and investment balances from the June 2006 equity financing. The increase in 2005 from 2004 is related to interest earned on higher average cash and investment balances from November 2005 equity financing. Other income/(expense) Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % Change 2005 2004 Change % Change (In thousands, except percentage values) Other income/(expense) $ 454 $ (395 ) $ 849 215 % $ (395 ) $ 212 $ (607 ) (286 )% During 2006, other income of $454,000 was principally comprised of a net gain on foreign currency translation. During 2005, other expense of $395,000 was comprised of a net loss on foreign currency translation of $374,000 and other than temporary loss on our marketable securities of $21,000. During 2004 other income of $212,000 was comprised of a net gain on foreign currency translation of $261,000 and an insurance settlement of $22,000, partially offset by other than temporary loss on our marketable securities of $71,000. The foreign currency translation gain/loss relates to foreign currency cash balance held by the foreign subsidiary. 40 Table of Contents We incurred net operating losses in 2006, 2005 and 2004, and consequently did not pay any federal or state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, payments from corporate collaborators, federal government research grants and financing activities such as a bank line of credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and interest receivable totaling $54.0 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $14.5 million in 2006, $4.0 million in 2005, and $10.1 million in 2004. In all periods, net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to funding of net operating losses. During 2006, the use of cash related to our net operating loss of $17.9 million, net of non cash charges of $7.1 million and net decrease of $3.7 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Non cash charges include $5.8 million related to issuance of common stock for Edwards asset purchase, $2.0 million related to stock based compensation expense related to FAS123R and amortization of premium/discount on marketable securities of $857,000. The net decreases in operating assets and liabilities are mainly attributable to decrease in deferred revenue of $4.2 million partially offset by net decreases in asset balances of $370,000. During 2005, the use of cash related to our net operating loss of $13.3 million net of non cash charges of $810,000 and net increases in operating assets and liabilities of $8.4 million. Non cash charges include amortization of premium/discount on marketable securities of $214,000 and $301,000 stock based compensation expense. The net increases in operating assets and liabilities is due to net increase in liability balances of $8.8 million, principally due to an increase in deferred revenue of $7.8 million, primarily related to the receipt of a license payment of $7.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 per the terms of the Research License and Commercial Option Agreement with DAS. During 2004, the use of cash related to the net operating loss of $13.8 million, partially offset by non cash charges and net increases in asset balances of $2.8 million and by amortization of premium/discount on marketable securities of $868,000. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(12.2) million in 2006, $(4.4) million in 2005 and $8.4 million in 2004. Cash was used during these periods to purchase investments and property and equipment and was offset by the maturities and sale of available for sale securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $20.9 million in 2006, $18.4 million in 2005 and $553,000 in 2004. In June 2006, in an underwritten public offering and pursuant to an effective registration statement, we sold 3,100,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $6.75 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $20.15 million after deducting underwriters discount. During 2005, the company completed a registered direct offering to institutional and strategic investors for a total of 5,080,000 shares of common stock at a price of $3.85 per share to the investors, resulting in net proceeds to Sangamo of approximately $18.2 million. All other cash provided by financing activities for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was solely related to proceeds from issuance of common stock related to stock options exercises. While we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future, in particular, to support our product development endeavors, we believe that the available cash resources, funds received from corporate collaborators, strategic partners and federal government research grants will be sufficient to finance our operations through 2008. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our ZFP Therapeutic development activities. Additional capital may not be available in terms acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, our business and our ability to develop our technology and our ZFP Therapeutic products would be harmed. There is no provision for income taxes because we have incurred losses. As of December 31, 2006, Sangamo had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $79.7 million, which expire in the years 2010 through 2026. The Company also has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $50.9 million, which expire in the years 2007 through 2016. The Company also has federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of $2.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The federal research credits will begin to expire in the year 2018 through 2026 and the state research credits have no expiration date. Use of the net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. The annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before use. 41 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2006 we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating leases $ 3,705 $ 445 $ 1,402 $ 1,509 $ 349 License obligations 877 213 664 Total contractual obligations $ 4,582 $ 658 $ 2,066 $ 1,509 $ 349 Operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in Richmond, California. License obligations consist of ongoing license maintenance fees, milestones and royalties due from sales of ZFP TFs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006 the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS 157. The standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. The standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 must be adopted prospectively as of the beginning of the year it is initially applied. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are still evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this standard will have on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which is a change in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet; and provides transition and interim period guidance, among other provisions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investments. The investments are available for sale. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risks. Our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations. We select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible within these guidelines. We invest excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers. We mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade securities. The portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. All investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value, which approximates cost. If market interest rates were to increase by one percent from December 31, 2006, the fair value of our portfolio would decline by less than $100,000. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest. We recognized a gain on foreign currency translation of $454,000 in 2006, loss of $374,000 and gain of $261,000 on foreign currency translation in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 42 Table of Contents
