ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements in this report about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward looking statements. You can identify these forward looking statements by the use of words or phrases such as "believe," "could," "may," "anticipate," "intend," "expect," "will," "plan," "estimate," "continue," "should" or "would". Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements are risks and uncertainties inherent in our business including, without limitation, the discussions set forth in Item 1A "Risk Factors" in this Report. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance or achievement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law. Overview VitalStream Holdings, Inc. provides products and services for storing and delivering audio and video digital media to large global audiences over the Internet. Our solutions enable companies to easily, securely and reliably create revenue streams from their media assets via subscription or ad based business models. Streaming Service for Flash, Streaming Service for Windows Media and Content Delivery Service represent our core product lines and provide the foundation on which all of our other products and services are based. These other services include audio and video streaming, live event streaming, media asset management, integrated hosting services, advertising solutions, subscription services, content delivery, and professional services. We also provide a self service, automatic streaming product that is available for small or home business customers through our small business platform. Our mix of products and services enables our customers to concentrate on the creation and marketing of their content, w hile outsourcing the encoding, data storage, broadcasting, hosting and related functions to VitalStream and its partners. Our business model leverages our expertise, experience and resources in audio and video streaming as well as our integrated hosting technology to persuade customers to utilize our Internet content delivery services. Our revenues primarily consist of monthly recurring revenues from contracts with terms of generally one year or more. These contracts usually have a fixed minimum commitment based on a certain level of usage with additional charges for any usage over the minimum commitment level. This monthly recurring revenue model allows us to build a base of consistent and predictable revenue streams. Our success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, and at the same time, growing this base by adding new customers with similar monthly recurring revenue arrangements, and by increasing sales of additional products and services to our customers. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] In 2005, we continued to position our Company to increase revenue and market share, and to take advantage of the demand and growth opportunities within the streaming media market. In addition to increasing our sales and marketing efforts, we invested heavily in our content delivery network to increase scalability and capacity to allow us to handle greater revenue growth. We also continued to supplement and enhance our portfolio of products and services. In 2006, we will continue to focus on driving growth in our revenue base. But we expect that these investments in our content delivery network, our product portfolio, and our sales and marketing efforts, will be increasingly offset by increases in volume purchasing gains, greater operational efficiencies and tight cost controls as we strive to be cash flow positive in 2006. The following are events and trends that will likely affect our financial condition and results of operations in 2006: l Revenue grew by 59% in 2005 compared to 2004. We expect that favorable trends in broadband adoption, Internet streaming usage, Internet advertising spending, and rich and streaming media spending will continue to drive growth in our revenue base. l Depreciation expense in 2005 was $1.3 million higher than in 2004. During the back half of 2005, we spent over $5 million to further strengthen our content delivery network infrastructure by upgrading our current storage architecture with a Storage Area Network (SAN) solution and adding an additional 1,000 servers distributed across our multiple data centers. We intend to continue to invest in our content delivery network as necessary. As a result of the above, and primarily due to the higher depreciation level beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005, depreciation will likely be higher in 2006. l Although our total bandwidth cost increased during 2005 compared to 2004, we were able to reduce our bandwidth cost per unit during 2005 as a result of favorably renegotiating certain bandwidth contracts and higher volume purchasing leverage. In 2006, we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of increasing usage levels, but will be partially offset by continued decreases in our bandwidth cost per unit. l In April 2005, and effective as of April 1, 2005, VitalStream acquired the business of PlayStream, LLC, a leading provider of small business streaming media services, headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The acquisition augmented our services and customer base, allowing us to offer an affordable, self service platform suited for small and medium size businesses (SMB) and small and home office (SOHO) customers and resellers. The deal was valued at $500,000 in cash, 3.75 million shares of VitalStream Holdings, Inc. common stock and 200,000 warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of $1.35. In 2005, the effect of only nine months was included in our financial statements while in 2006, a full 12 months will be included. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] l On December 31, 2005, we entered into an amended loan and security agreement (the "Amendment") with Comerica Bank. The Amendment amends the Loan and Security Agreement dated as of October 7, 2004. Effectively, the Amendment increases the existing revolving line of credit from $2,000,000 up to $2,235,000, revises the existing term line of credit from $2,000,000 to $1,900,607, and adds an additional fixed term loan of $2,000,000. To the extent we pay off theseloans outstanding with Comerica, earlier than scheduled, interest expense and income during 2006 will be affected accordingly. l Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 applies to all public companies. Under Section 404, public companies are required to design, establish and maintain an adequate system of internal financial and disclosure controls, assess such controls as of the end of each fiscal year, and engage an independent accounting firm to evaluate and provide an opinion on managements assessment of their controls. On March 2, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed by one year the date of effectiveness for compliance with the assessment and auditing requirements of Section 404 for non accelerated filers such as the Company until the end of fiscal 2006. We expect to be required to comply with Section 404 assessment, reporting and auditing requirements for fiscal 2006 and expect to incur additional costs in 2006 for the costs of the audit and achieving compliance. l Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS 123R, became effective January 1, 2006. Under SFAS 123R, we are required to record a deferred compensation expense for employee equity grants at the fair value at the time of grant. The deferred compensation calculated under a fair value method would then be amortized over the respective vesting period of the equity grant and will be included in results of operations. We expect this expense to be significant in 2006 and in the future as a result of this new requirement, as we have a large number of unvested employee options outstanding, and plan to continue to grant equity based compensation in the future. l On February 3, 2006, we closed a financing transaction with institutional investors by issuing 10,769,230 shares of common stock at a price of $1.30 per share generating gross proceeds to the Company of $14 million. Net proceeds from this transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including network and infrastructure expenditures, supporting domestic and international growth, and funding ongoing product development. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] While the opportunities for us are increasing, they are not without risk. Our business and our industry face numerous risks (see Item 1A "Risk Factors"), only some of which can be mitigated to varying degrees in advance, and others of which can only be dealt with reactively, if at all. As with any technology company, new technological advances within our industry could cause a paradigm shift in how we develop, market and deliver our products and services or how users perceive and use them. Some of these advances may be unavailable to us and we may not have a comparable or competitive technological offering. The upward trend in sales growth combined with operational efficiencies creates an opportunity for us to become profitable in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable in the future or on a sustained basis. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management is basing this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of accounts receivable, property, plant and equipment, long lived assets, intangible assets, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, and the amount of our revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Changes to these judgments and estimates could materially affect the Companys future results of operations and cash flows. l Valuation of Accounts Receivable. A considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables, including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of our customers. Significant portions of customer payments are made by credit card and electronic debit. Each month, management reviews historical charge back and cancellation patterns as well as historical data on other credits issued to customers and then records an allowance based on historical results as well as management judgment. Additionally, each month management reviews the aged receivables balance and records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the age of the outstanding receivable balances, trends in outstanding balances and managements judgment. As a result of these analyses, we believe that the current allowance is adequate to cover any bad debts and credits that may be issued as of the date of the balance sheet. If our estimates prove t o be wrong, however, and we have not accrued enough of a reserve to cover the bad debts and credits, we would have to accrue additional reserve in later periods to cover the shortfall. If the under accrual were substantial, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. On the other hand, if we have reserved too much, we may be able to lower our accrual in later periods which would have a positive effect on our financial results. l Goodwill. Goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is subject to impairment tests at least annually. Accordingly, we annually evaluate goodwill for potential impairment indicators. If impairment indicators exist we measure the impairment through the use of discounted cash flows. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions, and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the goodwill associated with our acquired business is impaired. If we subsequently determine that an impairment was or is required, we may be required to write down all, or part, of our goodwill. This would both reduce the amount of our assets, which may affect our ability to qualify for listing or continued listing on a stock exchange, and would reduce the amount of our net income (or increase the amount of our net loss) for the quarter and year in which the impairment was recogni zed. Depending on the size of the write down, the adverse impact on our financial results could be material. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] l Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of loss accrual required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. We consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary to assess any contingencies. A required accrual may change at some point in the future due to new developments in a matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. If our judgment proves to be wrong concerning a possible accrual or other contingency, the impact on our results of operations and cash flows could be material. If we have under accrued for a material liability, we would have to increase our accrual for later period, which could materially decrease our net income (or incr ease or net loss) for such period. The payment of any material contingent liability would also adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] Results of Operations VitalStream, Inc. was incorporated in March 2000 in the State of Delaware. On April 23, 2002, VitalStream merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of VitalStream Holdings. Because VitalStream Holdings did not have any operations immediately prior to the VitalStream merger, the primary business of VitalStream is now the business of VitalStream Holdings. VitalStream Holdings, Inc. ("VHI") was incorporated in 1986 in the State of Nevada. Effective as of January 1, 2003, we acquired certain customers and assets of Epoch Hosting and Epoch Networks, including our Los Angeles Broadcast Center. Our financial results for periods after January 1, 2003 reflect the integration of this acquisition. Effective as of April 1, 2005, we acquired the business of PlayStream, LLC. In 2005, the effect of nine months was included in our financial results while in 2006, a full twelve months will be included in our financial results. In 2004, we reviewed expenses in cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative for proper classification and made certain modifications. Salaries and benefits of employees who operate our network and certain network related facility costs were reclassified from research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative to cost of revenue. Certain costs not related to the operation of our network were reclassified from cost of revenue to general and administrative. These modifications had no impact on loss from operations or net loss. All prior periods shown reflect the effect of the reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation.

Revenue consists primarily of fees for Internet broadcasting, including streaming media services, managed services, web hosting and sales of hardware and software. Revenues increased from $9,972,078 for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $15,880,080 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 59.2%. This increase in revenue primarily reflects the addition of new customers using VitalStream services and technology to deliver streaming media, as well as additional revenue from the addition of new managed server and colocation customers and the increase in average per customer service utilization within the installed base of such customers. In addition, effective as of April 1, 2005, VitalStream acquired the business of PlayStream, LLC, a provider of small business streaming media services. PlayStream accounted for 9% of revenue during 2005. We expect revenue to grow throughout 2006 from the addition of new customers and from increased services to existing customers as we continue to release new produ cts and services, promote our new professional services value added offering, enhance our sales force, build on existing and add new channel and OEM partnerships, increase our marketing efforts, increase awareness of our products and services in our markets, and focus on new markets. Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of Internet backbone and transport costs, data center rent and power costs, depreciation of network and server equipment, network operations employee costs, hardware costs and software license fees. Cost of revenue increased from $4,599,905 for the year ended December 31, 2004, to $7,921,470 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 72.2%. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue, increased from 46.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 49.9% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increased cost in absolute dollars primarily reflects an increase in depreciation, licensing fees and bandwidth while the increased cost as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to higher depreciation and license fees. Depreciation increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales as a result of a significant investment in our content delivery network during the back half of 2005 to increase scalability and capacity. Software license fees increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales due to higher growth in streaming sales. Bandwidth costs increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of revenues due to economies of scale realized from our increasing purchasing volume and additional decreases in bandwidth prices. Effective January 1, 2006, our per unit license fees were reduced as a result of favorable pricing through increased purchasing volume from higher streaming sales. We also expect per unit bandwidth costs to decrease over 2006 as we increase efficiencies in distributing bandwidth among our carriers, and we achieve more favorable pricing through greater bandwidth purchasing volume. As such, excluding stock based compensation expense, during the first quarter of 2006, we expect the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to increase compared to full year 2005, as increases in depreciation from increased capital expenditures to increase the capacity and scalability of our content delivery network in the back half of 2005, and the effect of expensing employee stock options under SFAS 123R in 2006, are only partially offset by economies of scale in our relatively fixed cost base, such as our Internet backbone, network operations employee costs, and data center facility costs. Over the remaind er of 2006, we expect our unit cost of revenue to then decrease as we realize reductions in license fee and bandwidth costs, and the fixed portion of our costs are spread over an increasing revenue base. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs to develop new products, and maintain and enhance our product offering. Research and development expense increased 110.0% from $476,724 for the year ended December 31, 2004, to $1,001,301 for the year ended December 31, 2005. As a percentage of revenue, research and development increased from 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005. This absolute dollar increase reflects higher payroll and other costs to support our expanding product and service mix. The rise as a percentage of revenue was due to an increase in our efforts to develop new features and technology to enhance our core product offering. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars and to stay roughly the same or increase slightly as a percentage of revenue in 2006 compared to full year 2005, due to the effect of expensing employee stock options under SFAS 123R in 2006, and we continue to invest in our core product offering. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salary and commissions, in addition to the costs of various marketing programs. Sales and marketing expense increased from $2,861,351 for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $5,689,301 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 98.8%. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing increased from 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 35.9% for the year ended December 31, 2005. This absolute dollar increase reflects increased payroll and related costs to expand and support both the domestic and international sales force, increased commissions due to higher sales, and increased marketing and advertising costs to increase market awareness and generate new customers. The increase as a percentage of revenue represents additions to our sales force to begin developing our professional services business and increase market awareness internationally, particularly in Europe. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars during 2006, and to increase as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of 2006 compared to full year 2005 due to the effect of expensing employee stock options under SFAS 123R in 2006, but to decrease through the remainder of 2006 compared to full year 2005, as we expect revenue will grow at a faster rate than the increase in sales and marketing expenses. General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel expense, professional fees, insurance, legal costs, and costs to maintain and support our facilities. General and administrative expense increased from $2,769,848 for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $4,620,691 for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 66.8%. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased from 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in absolute dollars primarily related to costs required to support higher growth, temporary need to hire outside consultants to fill full time positions that are now permanently staffed, and expenses associated with the establishment and documentation of internal controls over the recording and reporting of financial transactions to fulfill the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. We expect general and administrative expense to incre ase in absolute dollars during 2006, and to stay the same or increase as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of 2006 compared to full year 2005 due to the effect of expensing employee stock options under SFAS 123R in 2006, but to decrease through the remainder of 2006 compared to full year 2005, as the relatively fixed general and administrative costs are spread over an increasing revenue base. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] Stock based Compensation. During 2004, 467,957 common stock options were modified in order to permit exercise at any time within 12 months of termination of employment for our former Chief Financial Officer as part of a severance agreement. Consistent with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44 (FIN No. 44), "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation", an interpretation of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, the modification resulted in a new measurement date. As a result, the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the common stock on the new measurement date for the options totaled $302,628 and was recorded as a non cash charge to stock based compensation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. There was no similar expense in 2005. Net Interest Expense. Net interest expense decreased from $461,313 for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $228,654 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the impact in 2004 of one time payments of approximately $231,000 of interest and premiums associated with the conversion of $1.1 million in Amended and Restated Convertible Promissory Notes (the "Convertible Notes") and all outstanding shares of 2003 Series A Preferred Stock into common stock during the second quarter of 2004. Excluding this transaction, net interest expense was roughly comparable at approximately $230,313 in 2004 compared to $228,654 in 2005. We expect net interest expense to decrease in 2006 due to increases in cash balances from warrant exercises and a private equity investment. On December 15, 2005, the Company received $1.8 million in cash from a warrant exercise by one our shareholders. The warrant exercised was issued as part of a private equity financing on June 16, 2004. The Company also received an additional $1.5 million in cash in January 2006 when all of the remaining investors holding warrants as part of the same equity investment exercised their warrants. Furthermore, the completion of a private equity financing on February 3, 2006 resulted in an inflow of $14 million in cash. This financing transaction was accomplished through a private placement of 10,769,230 shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $1.30 per share. Other Income (Expense). In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a one time write down of $613,772 on certain older network equipment with an original cost value of $1,315,799 net of accumulated depreciation of $702,027 that was replaced during our network architecture upgrade. This was offset by a one time gain of approximately $200,000 from the sale of certain smaller non core business hosting accounts to a third party in the first quarter of 2005. Net Loss. Our net loss increased from $1,545,885 for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $4,018,426 for the year ended December 31, 2005 due primarily to increased investments in our network infrastructure, product development, sales and marketing efforts, and general infrastructure. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS 123R, will be effective January 1, 2006. Under SFAS 123R, we will be required to record a deferred compensation expense for employee equity grants at the fair value at the time of grant. The deferred compensation calculated under a fair value method will then be amortized over the respective vesting period of the equity grant and will be included in results of operations. We expect this expense to be significant in 2006 and in the future, as we have a large number of unvested employee options outstanding, and plan to continue to grant equity based compensation in the future. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] Year ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2003 Revenue. Revenue consists primarily of fees for Internet broadcasting, including streaming media services, managed services, web hosting and sales of hardware and software. Revenues increased from $7,000,535 for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $9,972,078 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 42.4%. This increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the addition of new customers using VitalStream services and technology to deliver streaming media as well as additional revenue from the addition of new managed server and colocation customers and the increase in average per customer service utilization within the installed base of such customers. Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of Internet backbone and transport costs, data center rent and power costs, depreciation of network and server equipment, network operations employee costs, hardware costs and software license fees. Cost of revenue increased from $3,389,877 for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $4,599,905 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 35.7%. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue, however, decreased from 48.4% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 46.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increased cost in absolute dollars reflects the increase in bandwidth consumption, network equipment, and other items necessary to support the increase in revenue. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue between the two periods represents economies of scale primarily in the purchase of bandwidth due to our increasing purchasing volume and an industry wide decrease in bandwidth prices. Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs to develop and maintain our product offering. Research and development expense increased 29.0% from $369,510 for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $476,724 for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a percentage of revenue, research and development decreased from 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2004. This absolute dollar increase reflects higher payroll and other costs to support our expanding product and service mix. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due to lower spending in absolute dollars and relative to a significant increase in revenue. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salary and commissions, in addition to the costs of various marketing programs. Sales and marketing expense increased from $2,036,232 for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2,861,351 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 40.5%. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing decreased from 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004. This absolute dollar increase reflects increased payroll and related costs to expand and support the sales force, and increased marketing and advertising costs to increase market awareness and generate new customers. The decrease as a percentage of revenue represents relatively lower spending in absolute dollars relative to a significant increase in revenue. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel expense, professional fees and costs to maintain and support our facilities. General and administrative expense increased from $2,159,323 for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2,769,848 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 28.3%. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue however, decreased from 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in absolute dollars primarily related to additional infrastructure costs for administrative personnel necessary to support the growth in our customer and revenue base, in addition to a one time charge of approximately $188,000 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to payments due under a separation agreement with the Companys former Chief Executive Officer and President. This decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue i s primarily due to the relatively higher increase in revenue compared to the growth in costs. On March 2, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission postponed the date of effectiveness by one year for the assessment and auditing requirements for non accelerated filers under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, related to the establishment and documentation of internal controls over the recording and reporting of financial transactions, by one year. As a result, the Company now has until 2006 to prepare for the reporting and auditing requirements of Section 404. Given this announcement, we now expect to spread the costs of completing this project more evenly over 2005 and 2006. Stock based Compensation. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 467,957 common stock options were modified in order to permit exercise at any time within 12 months of termination of employment for our former Chief Financial Officer as part of a severance agreement. Consistent with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44 (FIN No. 44), "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation", an interpretation of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, the modification resulted in a new measurement date. As a result, the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the common stock on the new measurement date for the options totaled $302,628 and was recorded as a non cash charge to stock based compensation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. Net Interest Expense. Net interest expense increased from $150,229 for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $461,313 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to one time payments of approximately $231,000 of interest and premiums associated with the conversion of $1.1 million in Convertible Notes and all outstanding shares of 2003 Series A Preferred Stock into common stock during the second quarter of 2004, additional interest expense from increased use of capital lease financing, and increased interest expense from the use of a credit line under a previous factoring arrangement in place during the first half of 2004 but not in place during the first half of 2003. Net Loss. Our net loss increased from $1,055,310 for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,545,885 for the year ended December 31, 2004 due primarily to increased investments in our product development, sales and marketing efforts and general infrastructure, the non cash compensation charge related to the severance agreement with the companys former Chief Financial Officer, the charge related to the severance payments due under a separation agreement with our former Chief Executive Officer, and the one time interest expense associated with the conversion of the Amended and Restated Convertible Promissory Notes to common stock.

Our capitalized leases represent $850,903 plus interest spread over eight capitalized lease financing arrangements. The hardware and software obtained through these capital lease arrangements were used in our data center operations, for supplying service to our customers, maintaining and increasing the capacity of our internal network and providing the equipment needed for internal staff. In 2006, we intend to continue to invest in our content delivery network to increase capacity and scalability in order to accommodate the growth of our existing customer base and to support new customer growth as necessary. Liquidity and Capital Resources. On October 7, 2004, we entered into a one year $4,000,000 secured credit agreement (the " Loan and Security Agreement ") with Comerica Bank ("Comerica"). The Loan and Security Agreement included a term line of credit of up to $2,000,000 to finance equipment purchases made prior to September 30, 2005 with interest payable based on a rate equal to Comericas published prime rate plus 0.50% and a revolving line of credit of up to $2,000,000 for general working capital needs with interest payable based on a rate equal to Comericas published prime rate. On December 31, 2005, we entered into an amended loan and security agreement (the "Amendment") with Comerica Bank. The Amendment amends the Loan and Security Agreement dated as of October 7, 2004. The Amendment increases the revolving line of credit from $2,000,000 up to $2,235,000 for general working capital needs with interest payable based on a rate equal to Comericas published prime rate plus 0.50% until the maturity date of December 31, 2006. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] The Amendment also revises the term line of credit of up to $2,000,000 to finance equipment purchases made prior to September 30, 2005 to a fixed term amount of $1,900,607 with principal and interest payable monthly based on a rate equal to Comericas published prime rate plus 0.50% with a maturity date of September 30, 2007. The Amendment adds to the Loan and Security Agreement a fixed term loan of $2,000,000 to finance equipment purchases. Interest accrues on the term loan at Comericas published prime rate plus 1.00% with a maturity date of March 31, 2008. We have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure repayment of the credit facilities made available under the Comerica Agreement. We must also maintain a cash balance at Comerica of not less than $3,000,000 when aggregate outstanding advances under the credit facilities are less than or equal to $3,000,000, and a balance of not less than $3,500,000 when aggregate outstanding advances under the credit facilities are greater than $3,000,000. The Comerica Agreement also contains various other restrictive covenants related to our future operations. Effective April 1, 2005, VitalStream acquired the business of PlayStream, LLC, a leading provider of small business streaming media services, headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The deal was valued at $500,000 in cash, 3.75 million shares of VitalStream Holdings, Inc. common stock and 200,000 warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of $1.35. On December 15, 2005, the Company received $1.8 million in cash from a warrant exercise by one of our shareholders. The warrant exercised by the shareholder was issued as part of a private equity financing on June 26, 2004. The Company also received an additional $1.5 million in January 2006 when all of the remaining investors holding warrants as part of the same equity investment exercised their warrants. On February 3, 2006, we closed a private equity financing with institutional investors by issuing 10,769,230 shares of common stock at a price of $1.30 per share generating gross proceeds to the Company of $14 million. Net proceeds from this transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including network and infrastructure expenditures, supporting domestic and international growth, and funding ongoing product development. Uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2005 included cash used by operations of $2,876,594, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable at the end of 2005 from higher sales, and the fact that certain larger customers delayed making their payments until early 2006, and $7,494,428 used in investing activities, of which $6,997,360 was used for capital expenditures and approximately $500,000 was used as part of the consideration paid for the acquisition of PlayStream. Capital expenditures of $6,997,360 for 2005 compared to $3,065,112 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in capital expenditures during 2005 primarily related to the purchase of additional equipment to support the build out and upgrade of our network infrastructure in the second half of 2005 and to support the overall increase in sales. [ TABLE OF CONTENTS ] Sources of cash during the year ended December 31, 2005 included $4,213,008 from financing activities. Of the $4,213,008 of net cash provided by financing activities, $2,851,607 represents cash received from the bank through the credit facilities to fund capital expenditure purchases, and $2,667,435 was received from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, offset by payments on capital leases of $878,460. As a result of the above transactions in 2005, as of December 31, 2005, we had $4,118,308 in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $10,276,322 as of December 31, 2004. We had $200,626 of restricted cash at December 31, 2005, securing the lease for our Los Angeles Data Center. The February 3, 2006 financing together with the warrant exercises have further strengthened our balance sheet and have provided additional funds to enable the Company to make strategic acquisitions and or investments as necessary in the future. We hope to rapidly expand our operations during 2006. We may also seek to expand our operations through strategic acquisitions or investments. If we were to engage in strategic acquisitions, we may need to seek additional financing in order to pay for the transaction costs of any large mergers and or acquisitions (e.g., legal and accounting fees, integration expense and working capital to support the acquired entity). However, we expect that the cash we have on hand, together with recurring operating revenues and funds obtained through our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current and future obligations until the time that the Company can consistently sustain itself on its internally generated cash flow.
