ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In addition, for information on our critical accounting policies and the judgment made in their application, please read Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates beginning on page 43. Overview The primary macroeconomic growth indicators of our business include general growth in the economy, international trade, particularly out of Asia, the level of high tech spending and the increase in outsourcing of logistics projects. Business drivers that we control and focus on internally are our ability to: (i) link transportation services with our logistics services, (ii) cross sell our services to existing and prospective customers and (iii) collaborate with our customers to provide flexible, cost effective and profitable supply chain solutions. We achieved revenues of $3.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 3.9% increase over revenues of $3.10 billion in 2005. Net revenues increased by $62.3 million, or 6.6%, to $1.01 billion compared to $948.5 million in 2005. Operating income increased by 1.1% as compared to 2005 due to a $62.3 million increase in net revenues while our operating expenses increased $61.2 million. We remain committed to leveraging our infrastructure by seeking to contain our operating expenses and improving our yield management in 2007. The Company has received a proposal to purchase all of its outstanding common stock, and is exploring strategic alternatives. See Item 1, Offer to Purchase the Company. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in 2006 reflect, among other things, the following: Leveraging our global network. In 2006, we continued to leverage our global network and our ability to cross sell services in an effort to increase volumes through our service offerings in the geographic divisions we serve. In addition, our balanced product offering enabled us to provide flexible solutions to our customers both domestically and internationally. 29 Continued focus on net revenue margins. Gross revenues improved by 4% in 2006 as compared to 2005 as we continue to increase revenues with existing customers and win business from new customers. Net revenue margins improved to 31.4% in 2006 from 30.6% in 2005 due to an improvement in ocean freight forwarding margins and increased logistics revenues that have a high net revenue margin as compared to freight forwarding product lines. Stock option expense associated with revised measurement dates. In response to recent publicity regarding stock option practices at other companies, management, under the direction and oversight of the Audit Committee, conducted an internal review of historical stock option grant practices and related accounting treatment. Based upon this review, management and the Audit Committee determined that for certain stock option grants, mainly between 2000 and 2002, the measurement dates for accounting purposes were different from the recorded grant dates of the awards. The examination has been completed and we have determined that the cumulative impact of the adjustments related to incorrect measurement dates resulted in an understatement of compensation expense of $2.1 million pre tax. We concluded that the impact of these adjustments to the y ears 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 is not material to our consolidated financial statements and the cumulative impact of the adjustments has been recorded as a charge in personnel costs in the third quarter of 2006. Management and the Audit Committee found no indication of intentional misconduct in the dating of stock options. Goodwill impairment charge. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we performed our annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and recorded a non cash charge of $3.8 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in our South America segment, which is recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. The impairment resulted primarily from a decline in forecasted cash flows as well as a rise in the discount rate. Resolution of a business interruption claim for warehouse fire in our United Kingdom operations. On March 31, 2006, we resolved a business interruption claim and recorded a gain of $2.2 million. In addition, in March 2006, we received a payment on our outstanding property claim of $517,000 which resulted in a gain of $324,000. Sale of facility in the United Kingdom. On November 3, 2006, we sold a facility in the United Kingdom for $8.5 million. As a result, we recognized a gain on the sale of this asset of approximately $3.9 million. Global deployment of information technology systems. In 2006, we continued the global deployment of our EGL Vision Suite of Technologies Logistics Vision, Financial Vision, and People Vision. We also withdrew the Logistics Vision and Financial Vision from one country due to a consolidation of the finance function into a country on a different system. Logistics Vision is a freight forwarding system designed to allow a seamless flow of data across the globe and eliminate duplicate data entry on multiple systems. Financial Vision is an Oracle based financial system designed to allow global visibility of financial results and streamlined financial reporting, and the ability to automate intercompany accounting and settlements. People Vision is an Oracle based human resources application designed to allow global visibility to employ ee tracking, training and development. Management plans to continue development of Logistics Vision and Financial Vision to achieve the successful deployment of systems which remain a critical component of improving operational efficiencies and effectively growing the business. We plan in 2007 to work towards continued revenue growth within our existing network and continued improvement of working capital management plus improving yields and operational efficiencies. We have begun implementation of a resource improvement plan through which we are seeking savings through reductions in third party contracted services, corporate headcount reductions, incentive program restructuring and short term reductions in salary expense through temporary salary reductions or unpaid time off. 30 Results of Operations Our principal services are air freight forwarding, ocean freight forwarding, customs brokerage and other value added logistics services. Revenues for air freight and ocean freight consolidations (indirect shipments) include reimbursements from customers for the cost of transporting such freight. Revenues for air freight and ocean freight agency or direct shipments, customs brokerage and other services, include only the fees or commissions for these services. We believe that a comparison of gross revenues by product best measures the relative importance of our principal services, while a comparison of net revenue margins (net revenues as a percent of gross revenues) best measures the performance of each product line. A comparison of operating expenses as a percent of net revenues considers the relationship between operating expenses and operating revenues. The foll owing table provides certain statement of income data attributable to our principal services during the periods indicated.

Revenues increased $121.1 million, or 3.9%, to $3,217.6 million in 2006, compared to $3,096.5 million in 2005, due to an increase in air freight forwarding revenues of $80.6 million, an increase in ocean freight forwarding revenues of $17.8 million and an increase in customs brokerage and other revenues of $22.7 million. Net revenues, which represent revenues less freight transportation costs, increased $62.3 million, or 6.6%, to $1,010.8 million in 2006, compared to $948.5 million in 2005. Net revenue margins (net revenues as a percentage of revenues) improved by 80 basis points in 2006 to 31.4%, as compared to 30.6% in 2005 due to improvements in ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage and other margins. 31 Air freight forwarding revenues. Air freight forwarding revenues increased $80.6 million, or 4.0%, to $2,115.6 million in 2006, compared to $2,035.0 million in 2005, primarily due to continuing volume and shipment increases in Asia/South Pacific and volume increases in North America offset by shipment declines in South America and Europe/Middle East. Air freight forwarding net revenues increased $2.2 million, or 0.4%, to $560.3 million in 2006, compared to $558.1 million in 2005. Air freight forwarding net revenues increased primarily in North America. The air freight forwarding margin decreased to 26.5% for 2006, as compared to 27.4% for 2005, primarily due to declines in Asia/South Pacific resulting from the pass through of rising fuel costs to our customers which increased gross revenues without corresponding increases in net revenues. Ocean freight forwarding revenues. Ocean freight forwarding revenues increased $17.8 million, or 4.0%, to $461.6 million in 2006, compared to $443.8 million in 2005 primarily due to volume increases in Asia/South Pacific and Europe/Middle East due to our increased focus on the ocean market and our customers continued shift toward a lower cost deferred product. Ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased $16.5 million, or 18.4%, to $106.4 million in 2006, compared to $89.9 million in 2005, while the ocean freight forwarding margin increased to 23.0% for 2006, compared to 20.3% for 2005 from increases across all geographic divisions due to the introduction of more capacity by ocean carriers resulting in lower transportation costs. Customs brokerage and other revenues. Customs brokerage and other revenues, which include imports, warehousing, distribution and other logistics services, increased $22.7 million, or 3.7%, to $640.4 million in 2006, compared to $617.7 million in 2005. Customs brokerage revenues decreased primarily due to a decline in Europe/Middle East and North America trade activity, offset by increases in South America and Asia/South Pacific. Warehousing and logistics revenues increased due to continued growth in Asia/South Pacific, North America and South America as a result of the addition of several new logistics projects, offset by a decline in Europe/Middle East. Customs brokerage and other net revenues increased $43.7 million, or 14.5%, to $344.1 million in 2006, compared to $300.4 million in 2005. Customs brokerage and other margins increased to 53.7% for 2006, compared to 48.6% for 2005 primarily due to new projects with higher margins in North America, South America and Europe/Middle East and disposition of several lower margin projects. Personnel costs. Personnel costs include all compensation expenses, including those relating to sales commissions, incentive programs, salaries and temporary and contract labor. Personnel costs increased $36.2 million, or 6.9%, to $558.2 million in 2006, compared to $522.0 million in 2005. The increase in personnel costs was due primarily to increased headcount to support the increase in business activity, stock based compensation expense resulting from the implementation of FAS 123R and granting of restricted stock, an adjustment to correct our prior stock option grant practices, and increased temporary labor related to several new logistics projects in North America, offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. We implemented FAS 123R on January 1, 2006 and incurred $5.8 million of stock based compensation expense during 2006 relate d to stock options and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We also incurred $853,000 in stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants. In addition, we recorded $2.1 million of stock based compensation in 2006 related to our review of our option grant practices during the 1996 through 2005 fiscal years. Stock based compensation for 2005 was $191,000. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded charges of $1.6 million for workforce reductions, mainly in certain European and U.S. locations. We have historically maintained incentive bonus, profit sharing and sales commission compensation plans to reward attainment of targets. Our incentive bonus and profit sharing compensation plans include a combination of target achievements related to total company financial performance, business unit financial performance and individual goals and objectives. In 2006, more challenging financial performance targets were introduced which have resulted in a lower level of incentive compensation 32 expense in 2006 as compared to 2005. As a percentage of net revenues, personnel costs increased to 55.2% in 2006, compared to 55.0% in 2005. Other selling, general and administrative expenses. Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased $19.1 million, or 5.7%, to $356.1 million in 2006, compared to $337.0 million in 2005. As a percentage of net revenues, other selling, general and administrative expenses were 35.2% in 2006, compared to 35.5% in 2005. The increase is due primarily to a $12.8 million increase in facilities costs, an $11.0 million increase in professional fees and a $3.8 million goodwill impairment charge, offset by decreased depreciation and bad debt expense. In addition, in 2006, we recorded a $3.9 million gain from the sale of a facility in the United Kingdom. EEOC legal settlement. During 2005, we recaptured $6.0 million of the $8.5 million previously held in a fund to resolve potential claims in connection with a 2001 consent decree with the EEOC, resulting primarily from a significantly lower number of qualified claimants than originally projected. Nonoperating (income) expense, net. Nonoperating (income) expense, net includes interest expense, interest income, minority interest expense, equity in (earnings) losses from affiliates, foreign exchange (gains) losses and other nonoperating (income) expenses. Nonoperating expense was $8.8 million in 2006 as compared to nonoperating income of $5.1 million in 2005. In 2006, we had foreign exchange losses of $2.8 million, as compared to foreign exchange gains of $2.5 million in 2005. In 2006, we received a gain of $1.0 million on the sale of TDS from receipt of escrow payments as compared to $4.0 million in 2005. See note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we incurred net interest expense of $7.3 million in 2006, compared to $2.7 million in 2005. Effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2006 was 35.7% compared to 42.2% for 2005. Our effective tax rates fluctuate due to changes in the level of pre tax income in foreign countries that have different rates and certain income and or expenses that are permanently non taxable or non deductible in certain jurisdictions including the U.S. The reduced effective tax rate includes the benefits of foreign deferred tax account adjustments and the utilization of valuation allowances against current period taxable earnings due to higher profitability in Europe. 2005 Compared to 2004 Revenues. Revenues increased $355.1 million, or 13.0%, to $3,096.5 million in 2005, compared to $2,741.4 million in 2004, due to an increase in air freight forwarding revenues of $236.0 million, an increase in ocean freight forwarding revenues of $52.2 million and an increase in customs brokerage and other revenues of $66.8 million. Net revenues, which represent revenues less freight transportation costs, increased $83.1 million, or 9.6%, to $948.5 million in 2005, compared to $865.4 million in 2004. Net revenue margins (net revenues as a percentage of revenues) declined by 100 basis points in 2005 to 30.6%, as compared to 31.6% in 2004. The decrease in margins reflects rising fuel costs and the continued acceleration of growth in international air and ocean products which carry a lower net revenue margin but higher net revenue per shipmen t. Our international revenues and costs also increased slightly over the prior year due to the effects of translating amounts to the U.S. dollar. Air freight forwarding revenues. Air freight forwarding revenues increased $236.0 million, or 13.1%, to $2,035.0 million in 2005, compared to $1,799.0 million in 2004, primarily due to continuing volume and shipment increases in Asia Pacific and volume increases in North America. Air freight forwarding net revenues increased $50.0 million, or 9.8%, to $558.1 million in 2005, compared to $508.1 million in 2004. Air freight forwarding net revenues increased primarily in North America followed by Asia Pacific and Europe/Middle East. The air freight forwarding margin (net revenues as a percentage of revenues) decreased to 27.4% for 2005, as compared to 28.2% for 2004, primarily due to declines in Asia Pacific resulting from the pass through of rising fuel costs to our customers which increased gross revenues without corresponding increases in net revenues. 33 Ocean freight forwarding revenues. Ocean freight forwarding revenues increased $52.2 million, or 13.3%, to $443.8 million in 2005, compared to $391.6 million in 2004 primarily due to volume increases in Asia Pacific, Europe/Middle East and North America due to our increased focus on the ocean market and our customers continued shift toward a lower cost deferred product. Ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased $13.7 million, or 18.0%, to $89.9 million in 2005, compared to $76.2 million in 2004, while the ocean freight forwarding margin increased to 20.3% for 2005, compared to 19.5% for 2004. Ocean freight forwarding margins steadily declined throughout 2004 due to higher carrier rates and increased volumes of business in the competitive transpacific east bound and Asia to Europe tradelanes. Margins have begun to increase in 2005 from improved margins on ocean exports out of North America due to more available capacity introduced by ocean carriers. Customs brokerage and other revenues. Customs brokerage and other revenues, which include imports, warehousing, distribution and other logistics services, increased $66.8 million, or 12.1%, to $617.7 million in 2005, compared to $550.9 million in 2004. Customs brokerage revenues increased primarily due to growth in Europe/Middle East and North America trade activity. Warehousing and logistics revenues increased due to growth in all geographic divisions. Customs brokerage and other net revenues increased $19.4 million, or 6.9%, to $300.4 million in 2005, compared to $281.0 million in 2004. Customs brokerage and other margins, however, decreased to 48.6% for 2005, compared to 51.0% for 2004 primarily due to lower margins in Europe/Middle East and North America resulting from termination or completion of several high margin logistics projects. Personnel costs. Personnel costs include all compensation expenses, including those relating to sales commissions, incentive programs, salaries and temporary and contract labor. Personnel costs increased $40.7 million, or 8.5%, to $522.0 million in 2005, compared to $481.3 million in 2004. The increase in personnel costs was due primarily to increased hiring as a result of the increase in business activity and salary adjustments. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded charges of $1.6 million for workforce reductions, mainly in certain European and U.S. locations. We have historically maintained incentive bonus, profit sharing and sales commission compensation plans to reward attainment of targets. Our incentive bonus and profit sharing compensation plans include a combination of target achievements re lated to total company financial performance, business unit financial performance and individual goals and objectives. For 2005, more challenging financial performance targets were introduced which have resulted in a lower level of incentive compensation expense in 2005. As a percentage of net revenues, personnel costs decreased to 55.0% in 2005, compared to 55.6% in 2004. Other selling, general and administrative expenses. Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased $34.3 million, or 11.3%, to $337.0 million in 2005, compared to $302.7 million in 2004. As a percentage of net revenues, other selling, general and administrative expenses were 35.5% in 2005, compared to 35.0% in 2004. The increase is due primarily to the $2.9 million penalty for improper government billings, increased fees for the continued deployment of our Vision suite of technologies freight forwarding, accounting and human resources systems as well as increased accounting and tax fees and increased insurance costs due to higher claims activity in the U.S. and cargo claims accruals relating to the warehouse fire in the United Kingdom. EEOC legal settlement. During 2005, we recaptured $6.0 million of the $8.5 million previously held in a fund to resolve potential claims in connection with a 2001 consent decree with the EEOC, resulting primarily from a significantly lower number of qualified claimants than originally projected. Nonoperating income (expense), net. Nonoperating income (expense), net includes interest expense, interest income, minority interest expense, equity in earnings (losses) from affiliates, foreign exchange gains (losses) and other nonoperating income (expenses). Nonoperating income was $5.1 million in 2005 as compared to nonoperating income of $7.3 million in 2004. In 2005, we had foreign 34 exchange gains of $2.5 million, as compared to foreign exchange losses of $1.4 million in 2004. In 2004, we sold our investment in Miami Air and realized a gain of approximately $6.7 million. We sold our investment in TDS in 2004 for approximately $51.4 million in cash. We received approximately $45.3 million of the sale proceeds in August 2004. In 2004, the TDS sale resulted in a gain of approximately $5.9 million, which excludes the proceeds held in escrow. In 2005, we recorded a gain of $4.0 million following the resolution of certain contingencies. See note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we incurred net interest expense of $2.7 million in 2005, compared to $6.2 million in 2004, and had equity losses of affiliates of $85,000 in 2005, compared to earnings of $1.7 million in 2004. Effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2005 was 42.2% compared to 42.6% for 2004. Our effective tax rates fluctuate due to changes in the level of pre tax income in foreign countries that have different rates and certain income and or expenses that are permanently non taxable or non deductible in certain jurisdictions including the U.S. The penalty related to the KBR war surcharge is non deductible for U.S. tax purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, fund working capital and make capital expenditures depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we achieve significant near term revenue growth, we may experience a need for increased working capital financing as a result of the difference between our cash collection cycles and the timing of our payments to vendors. Historically we have generated cash flow from operations in the first half of the year higher than in the second half of the year reflecting the seasonality of our business. We make significant disbursements on behalf of our customers for transportation costs (primarily ocean) and customs duties for which the customer is the primary obligor. The billings to customers for these disbursements, which are several times the amount of revenues and fees derived from these transactions, are not recorded as revenues and expenses on our statement of income; rather, they are reflected in our trade receivables and trade payables. Growth in the level of this activity or lengthening of the period of time between incurring these costs and being reimbursed by our customers for these costs may negatively affect our liquidity. As primarily a non asset based freight forwarder, we do not have the same level of capital expenditures that would be required of an asset based forwarder. We believe our anticipated capital expenditures for 2007 will be in the range of $30 to $35 million, including approximately $8 to $12 million expected on information systems expenditures. Based on current plans, we believe that our existing capital resources, including $131.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $247.7 million of available borrowing capacity on our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements through December 31, 2007. However, future changes in our business could cause us to consume available resources before that time. Additionally, funds may not be available when needed and even if available, additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock, which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing shareholders. If adequate funds are unavailable, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities, including, without limitation, the timing and extent of our marketing programs, and the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel. We cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 35 2006 Compared to 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $75.4 million in 2006, compared to $156.1 million in 2005. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to a $33.8 million net decrease in cash from changes in working capital for 2006, compared to a $49.4 million net increase for 2005. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital is due to a $48.1 million increase in trade receivables due to an 8% increase in days sales outstanding from 61 days at December 31, 2005 to 66 days at December 31, 2006. In addition to the increase in trade receivables, there was a $14.1 million increase in payables and other accrued liabilities, compared with a $29.5 million increase in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2006 was $19.2 million, compared to $29.4 million in 2005. Capital expenditures were $47.5 million during 2006, compared to $41.2 million during 2005, a $6.3 million increase. The expenditures in 2005 were mainly due to the implementation of our operational and financial systems, other software expenditures and equipment purchases. $12.5 million of the capital expenditures in 2005 relate to the purchase of a corporate plane. Restricted cash decreased by $2.3 million in 2006 as compared to a decrease of $5.3 million in 2005. In 2005, in connection with our acquisition of Miami International Forwarders in 2003 and the buyout of a minority interest partner in Thailand in 2001, we made earnout payments totaling $4.4 million. In 2006 and 2005, we r eceived proceeds of $23.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, from sales of other property and equipment. The increase in 2006 is due, in part, to proceeds of $11.5 million from the sale of the company aircraft and $8.5 million from the sale of a facility in the United Kingdom. Net cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities in 2006 was $47.3 million, compared to $107.7 million in 2005. The cash used in financing activities in 2006 consists of $547.2 million in repayments of debt (primarily related to our revolving line of credit), $4.4 million of repayment of financed insurance premiums, and $1.9 million in payments of capital lease obligations, offset by $481.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of debt (primarily related to our revolving line of credit), $15.0 million in proceeds from the exercise of 670,000 stock options, $5.4 million in excess tax benefits from employee stock options, $2.8 million from issuances of short term debt, net of repayments and $1.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of 86,000 shares of common stock from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The cash used in financing activities in 2005 consists of $309.3 million in repayments of debt (primarily related to our revolving line of credit), $211.0 million in cash payments for the repurchase of 8.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock from our tender offer, $94.3 million in cash payments for the repurchase of 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock, $3.5 million in payments of financing fees related to our new Amended and Restated Credit Facility, $3.4 million of repayment of financed insurance premiums, $2.7 million from the repayment of short term debt, net of issuances and $2.2 million in payments of capital lease obligations, offset by $495.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of debt (primarily related to our revolving line of credit), $21.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of 1.0 million stock options and $1.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of 66,000 shares of common stock from our ESPP. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $156.1 million in 2005, compared to $32.1 million in 2004. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a $49.4 million net increase in cash from changes in working capital for 2005, compared to $61.4 million net decrease for 2004. The increase in cash from changes in working capital is due to a $20.2 million decrease in trade receivables due to improved collection efforts as evidenced by a 13% decrease in days sales outstanding from 70 days at December 31, 2004 to 61 days at December 31, 2005. In addition to the decrease in trade receivables, there was a $29.5 million increase in payables and other accrued liabilities, compared with a $79.8 million increase in 2004. 36 Net cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2005 was $29.4 million, compared to $7.0 million in 2004. Capital expenditures were $41.2 million during 2005, compared to $38.2 million during 2004, a $3.0 million increase. The expenditures in 2005 were mainly due to the implementation of our operational and financial systems, other software expenditures and equipment purchases. $12.5 million of the capital expenditures in 2005 relate to the purchase of a corporate plane. Restricted cash decreased by $5.3 million in 2005 as compared to an increase of $3.4 million in 2004. During 2005 and 2004, in connection with our acquisition of Miami International Forwarders in 2003 and the buyout of a minority interest partner in Thailand in 2001, we made earnout payments totaling $4.4 million and $3.3 million , respectively. During 2004, we received proceeds of $6.7 million for the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated affiliate, Miami Air, to an unrelated party and proceeds of $45.3 million for the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated affiliate, TDS, to an unrelated party. During the second quarter of 2004, we acquired the outside ownership of our consolidated affiliates in France, Spain and Portugal for aggregate consideration of $16.2 million in cash. In 2005 and 2004, we received proceeds of $4.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, from sales of other property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities in 2005 was $107.7 million, compared to $22.6 million in 2004. The cash used in financing activities in 2005 consists of $309.3 million in repayments of debt (primarily related to our revolving line of credit), $211.0 million in cash payments for the repurchase of 8.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock from our tender offer, $94.3 million in cash payments for the repurchase of 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock, $3.5 million in payments of financing fees related to our new Amended and Restated Credit Facility, $3.4 million of repayment of financed insurance premiums, $2.7 million from the repayment of short term debt, net of issuances and $2.2 million in payments of capital lease obligations, offset by $495.6 million in proceeds from the issuance o f debt (primarily related to our revolving line of credit), $21.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of 1.0 million stock options and $1.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of 66,000 shares of common stock from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The cash used in financing activities in 2004 consists of $6.4 million of repayment of financed insurance premiums, $59.1 million in cash payments for the repurchase of 3.4 million shares of our outstanding common stock, $218.8 million in repayments of debt (primarily related to our revolving line of credit) and $1.1 million in payments of financing fees related to our new Credit Facility, offset by $39.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of 2.1 million stock options, $211.0 million proceeds from the issuance of debt (primarily related to our revolving line of credit) and $791,000 in proceeds from the issuance of 42,000 shares of common stock from our ESPP. Other factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We entered into an agreement dated as of September 30, 2005 establishing a $300 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates our prior revolving credit agreement dated as of September 15, 2004, as previously amended (the Prior Credit Agreement). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is with a syndicate of 13 financial institutions with Bank of America, N.A. as lender and administrative agent and matures on September 30, 2010. We may use borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for working capital, capital expenditures and other lawful corporate purposes, to make permitted acquisitions and investments, to pay dividends and to repurchase our common stock. Amounts borrowed under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and secured equally and ratably by: all of our present and future shares of capital stock of (or other ownership or profit interests in) each of our present and future subsidiaries (limited, in the case of certain material first tier foreign subsidiaries, to a pledge of 65% of the capital stock of such subsidiaries); 37 all of our and each of our domestic subsidiaries present and future property and assets; and all proceeds and products of the property and assets described above. Loans under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement bore interest initially at a rate per annum equal to either, at our option, (1) LIBOR plus 1.25% or (2) the Base Rate (defined as the higher of Bank of America, N.A.s prime rate or 0.50% over the Federal Funds rate). In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.20% on the undrawn amounts under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Interest rates and commitment fees under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are subject to increase or decrease as a function of the ratio of our Consolidated Net Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). We may select interest periods of one, two, three or six months for LIBOR loans, subject to availability. Interest will be payable at the end of the selected interest per iod, but no less frequently than quarterly. Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are subject to various covenants, including, among others, the following: a requirement that we maintain, on a rolling four quarter basis, a ratio of Consolidated Net Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2006, and decreasing to 3.0 to 1.0 thereafter; a requirement that, on a rolling four quarter basis, we have a ratio of Consolidated EBIT to Consolidated Interest Charges (each as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of at least 2.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2006, and increasing to 3.0 to 1.0 thereafter; a requirement that, at the end of each fiscal quarter, we have a ratio of book accounts receivable by us and our subsidiaries to Consolidated Net Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of at least 1.1 to 1.0; and limitations on, among other things, liens indebtedness, asset sales, dividends and stock redemptions, investments and acquisitions, transactions with affiliates and consolidations, mergers and sales of all or a substantial part of our consolidated assets. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains events of default customary for an agreement of this type, including without limitation, an event of default upon certain specified changes in control. The occurrence of certain specified internal control events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us also constitutes an event of default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. If a default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent may, among other things, declare all outstanding principal amounts immediately due and payable. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains a $75 million sub facility for letters of credit. On October 4, 2005, we borrowed approximately $95.8 million under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to partially fund the purchase of shares of our common stock in connection with the tender offer (see note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements). At December 31, 2006, we had borrowings of $37.0 million, $15.3 million in letters of credit outstanding and unused borrowing capacity of $247.7 million under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Note Purchase Agreement. On October 12, 2005, we entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement) providing for the issuance and sale of $100 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate, senior secured notes due October 12, 2012 (the Notes) to the purchasers named therein. Banc of America Securities LLC acted as placement agent for this offering. The issuance and sale of the Notes by us, and the resale of the Notes by Banc of America Securities LLC was made pursuant to one or more exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. 38 We used the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay the amounts outstanding under our $100 million bridge loan facility established by an agreement (the Bridge Loan Agreement) dated as of September 30, 2005, among EGL and the other parties thereto. The Bridge Loan Agreement was entered into in connection with the tender offer. The Bridge Loan Agreement was terminated upon repayment. The Notes are guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and are secured by: all of our present and future shares of capital stock of (or other ownership or profit interests in) each of our present and future subsidiaries (limited, in the case of certain material first tier foreign subsidiaries, to a pledge of 65% of the capital stock of such subsidiaries); all of our and each of our domestic subsidiaries present and future property and assets; and all proceeds and products of the property and assets described above. The Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with our obligations under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the obligations of our guarantor subsidiaries to guarantee our obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement rank pari passu in right of payment with their guarantees in respect of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Interest on the Notes will accrue at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 1.65% for the applicable interest period. Interest periods are defined as the three month period commencing on the closing date and each successive three month period thereafter. Interest on the Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each interest period. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, we are subject to various covenants, including, among others, the following: a requirement that we maintain, on a rolling four quarter basis, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0; a requirement that we maintain, on a rolling four quarter basis, a ratio of Consolidated EBIT to Consolidated Interest Expense (each as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of at least 2.5 to 1.0; a requirement that we have, at all times, a ratio of (x) book accounts receivable of the Company and certain subsidiaries to (y) Consolidated Net Debt (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of at least 1.1 to 1.0; a requirement that we not, at any time, permit the aggregate amount of all Priority Debt (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to exceed 10% of our Consolidated Net Worth (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter; and limitations on, among other things, liens asset sales, dividends and stock redemptions, investments and acquisitions, transactions with affiliates and consolidations and mergers and a requirement that we offer to prepay the note in the event of specified changes in control. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary events of default. If a default occurs and is continuing, the Notes then outstanding shall (either automatically or by declaration of the holders of more than 50% of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding, depending upon the circumstances resulting in the default) become immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs and is continuing because we failed to pay principal, interest or other amounts due and payable on the Notes, then any Note holder may declare all of the Notes held by it to be immediately due and payable. 39 Release of restricted cash. In February 2005, in response to a joint motion filed by EGL and the EEOC, a U.S. District Court ordered the return of $6.0 million to us of $8.5 million previously held in an established fund to resolve potential claims in connection with a 2001 consent decree (see note 17 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements). The joint motion and subsequent order resulted in $6.0 million in income in the first quarter of 2005. Capital expenditures. We are in the process of developing and implementing computer system solutions for operational, human resources and financial systems. Our capital expenditures were approximately $11.0 million and $10.1 million related to the development of these systems during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our expected capital expenditures for 2007 are approximately $30 to $35 million, including approximately $8 to $12 million for information technology development and upgrades. TDS Logistics, Inc. In August 2004, we sold our investment in TDS Logistics, Inc. (TDS) to an unrelated party for approximately $51.4 million in cash. We received approximately $45.3 million of the sale proceeds in August 2004, with additional payments totaling $3.3 million in 2005 and $1.3 million in January 2006. The remaining $1.5 million of the sale proceeds are held in escrow subject to the resolution of certain contingencies and time periods. The sale resulted in an initial gain of $5.9 million in 2004 and an additional gain of $4.0 million in 2005 when certain funds were released out of escrow. These amounts are included in non operating income in our consolidated statement of income. Share repurchase program. On April 4, 2005, our Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $60 million in value of our outstanding common stock depending on market conditions and other factors with an expiration date of August 4, 2005. On May 31, 2005, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the maximum dollar amount of shares to be repurchased from $60 million to $120 million and extended the expiration date to September 28, 2005. As of September 28, 2005, we had repurchased a total of 5.0 million shares at an average price of $18.98 per share for approximately $94.3 million. On August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a modified Dutch Auction self tender offer to purchase up to 9,615,000 shares (up to $250 million) of its common stock, representing approximately 20% of its approximately 47.2 million outstanding shares as of August 24, 2005. The tender offer commenced on Tuesday, August 30, 2005 and expired on Wednesday, September 28, 2005. In the tender offer, shareholders had the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares at a price not less than $22.50 per share or more than $26.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest. On October 4, 2005, we announced the final results of the tender offer. An aggregate of 8,085,958 shares were properly tendered and not withdrawn at or below a price of $26.00. Because shareholders tendered less than 9,615,000 shares, there was no proration of tendered shares. We financed the tender offer with the use of cash on hand and borrowings of $196.0 million under both the new $300 million line of credit facility and the $100 million bridge loan that was refinanced by the issuance of $100 million of floating rate senior secured notes due in October 2012 (see note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements). As a result, we accepted for purchase and paid approximately $211.0 million for all 8,085,958 shares at a price of $26.00 per share. Any shares received in the tender offer that were not tendered properly were return ed to the tendering shareholders. The shares purchased pursuant to the tender offer represented approximately 17.1% of EGLs outstanding shares as of September 30, 2005. In February and March 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $65 million in value of our outstanding common stock depending on market conditions and other factors. During the program, which expired in July 2004, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $17.37 per share for approximately $59.1 million. Stock options. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding non qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of 2.3 million shares of common stock at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the dates of grant (prices ranging from $8.88 to $48.62). At the 40 time a non qualified stock option is exercised, we will generally be entitled to a deduction for federal and state income tax purposes equal to the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date of exercise and the option price. As a result of non qualified stock option exercises in 2006 and 2005 to purchase an aggregate of 635,000 and 920,000 shares of common stock, we are entitled to a federal and state income tax deduction of approximately $14.0 million and $10.6 million, respectively. We have recognized a reduction of our federal and state income tax obligations of approximately $5.6 million and $4.4 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Accordingly, we recorded an increase to additional paid in capital and a reduction to current taxes payable. Any exercises of non qualified stock options in the future at exercise prices below the t hen fair market value of the common stock may also result in tax deductions equal to the difference between those amounts. There is uncertainty as to whether the exercises will occur, the amount of any deductions, and our ability to fully utilize any tax deductions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. Our significant off balance sheet arrangements include liabilities associated with guarantees secured by letters of credit, surety bonds and security time deposits and non cancelable operating leases. We have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities. Guarantees. We guarantee certain financial liabilities, the majority of which relate to our freight forwarding operations. In the normal course of our business, we are required to guarantee certain amounts related to customs bonds and services received from airlines. These types of guarantees are usual and customary in the freight forwarding industry. We operate as a customs broker and prepare and file all formal documentation required for clearance through customs agencies, obtain customs bonds, facilitate the payment of import duties on behalf of the importer and arrange for payment of collect freight charges. We also assist the importer in obtaining the most advantageous commodity classifications, qualifying for duty drawback refunds and arranges for surety bonds for importers. We secure these guarantees primarily by three methods: a $75 million standby letter of credit sub facility included within our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, surety bonds and security time deposits. Security time deposits are restricted as to withdrawal for a specified timeframe and are classified on our balance sheet as restricted cash. As of December 31, 2006, we had $15.3 million in letters of credit outstanding. We also issue IATA (International Air Transportation Association) related guarantees, customs bonds and other working capital credit line guarantees in the normal course of business. IATA related guarantees and customs bonds are issued to facilitate the movement and clearance of freight. Working capital credit line guarantees include, but are not limited to, guarantees associated with insurance requirements and certain potential tax obligations. Generally, guarantees have one year or two year terms and are renewed upon expiration. As of December 31, 2006, total IATA related guarantees, customs bonds and other working capital credit line guarantees were approximately $100.4 million. Approximately $76.9 million of guarantees, customs bonds and borrowings against credit line guarantees were outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Of such am ounts, $4.0 million represents guarantees of our trade payables and accrued transportation costs and borrowings against our international credit facilities, which were recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Leases. We enter into operating lease agreements, principally for freight operation facilities and office space. These leases are non cancelable and expire on various dates through 2027. Certain of our lease agreements contain renewal options and rent escalation clauses. These leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease payment for use of facilities, rather than purchasing the facilities. Rent expense for operating leases was $88.2 million, $80.8 million and $86.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which is net of sublease income of $4.1 million, $3.7 41 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Please refer to Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for more details regarding our outstanding leases. Disclosures About Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments A summary of payments due by period of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006 are shown in the table below (in thousands). A more complete description of these obligations and commitments is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt including interest $ 225,867 $ 23,938 $ 33,444 $ 60,785 $ 107,700 Other liabilities (Note 7) 124,750 108,886 8,838 4,098 2,928 Benefit plan contributions (Note 13) 1,864 1,864 Capital lease obligations (Note 18) 1,187 905 250 18 14 Operating leases (Note 18) 433,754 87,882 135,378 88,165 122,329 Total contractual obligations $ 787,422 $ 223,475 $ 177,910 $ 153,066 $ 232,971 In addition to the contractual obligations above, as of December 31, 2006 we have payments of up to $200,000 contingently payable during 2007 related to business acquisitions. See note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions Aircraft usage payments James R. Crane, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, held interests in two entities (one of which is 50% owned and one of which is wholly owned by Mr. Crane) that lease passenger aircraft to us. From time to time, our employees use these aircraft in connection with travel associated with our business, for which we make payments to those entities. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we reimbursed Mr. Crane $1.2 million for actual hourly usage of the aircraft. In January 2005, we purchased for $12.5 million from an unrelated third party an aircraft that was previously leased by an entity controlled by Mr. Crane. This plane was initially expected to be utilized for business travel, eliminating the prior arrangement whereby EGL used Mr. Cranes aircraft and reimbursed Mr. Crane the cost thereof. On July 18, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of EGL approved, in lieu of incremental cash compensation, an arrangement to provide Mr. Crane, or his designees, with up to an aggregate of 150 hours per year of personal use of our aircraft without reimbursement by Mr. Crane. Mr. Crane actually used 158.7 hours in 2005. On March 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the 8.7 hours of overage and reduced the amount allowed for personal usage in 2006 by 8.7 hours to 141.3 hours. In 2006, Mr. Cranes personal usage amounted to 62.6 hours. We included usage of 158.7 and 62.6 hours in Mr. Cranes taxable income for 2005 and 2006, respectively, as required by current U.S. federal income tax regulations. The U.S. federal income tax regulations also restrict the amount of corporate tax deductions for operating costs and tax depreciation attributable to personal use of the company plane. The amount of non deductible personal use expense is reduced by the imputed income recognized by the employee. On August 5, 2005, the Board of Directors of EGL approved, in lieu of additional director cash compensation that would make the existing compensation package more competitive, an arrangement to provide the independent members of the Board of Directors with limited personal usage of our aircraft, without reimbursement by the directors. Personal usage of the aircraft by the directors is subj ect to availability, with priority given to our usage, 42 and the cumulative number of hours allowed for all directors may not exceed 100 hours per year. We will record the number of hours utilized by each director and include in such directors yearly taxable income the amount required by then current U.S. federal income tax regulations. In 2006 and 2005, the directors did not utilize the company plane for personal use. In the second quarter of 2006, we made a decision to sell the aircraft as it was not utilized to the extent anticipated when purchased. As of June 30, 2006, we had designated the aircraft as an asset held for sale. We reclassified $11.4 million, which represents the net realizable value of the aircraft as of June 30, 2006, from property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale. We recognized an impairment loss on the asset of $369,000, which is the difference of the carrying value of the asset and the net realizable value of the asset at June 30, 2006. In December 2006, we sold the aircraft to an unrelated third party for an aggregate cash purchase price of $11.5 million. We recognized a loss of $55,000, which is included in other income on our condensed consolidated statement of income. On November 13, 2006, we entered into a Non Exclusive Aircraft Lease Agreement with JRC Citation, LLC for the lease of one 2006 Cessna Citation X aircraft. JRC Citation, LLC is controlled by James R. Crane. We plan to use the aircraft for business travel by our employees and directors. The lease has a one year term and each party has the right to terminate the lease without cause upon thirty days written notice. The lease is non exclusive, and JRC Citation, LLC may also lease the aircraft to other parties during the term of the lease. Our use of the aircraft is on an as needed basis and we are not committed to any minimum usage of the aircraft. We will pay rent on the aircraft based on each flight hour of use of the aircraft at the rate of $2,200 per flight hour. We are also obligated to obtain or supply all services and supplies necessary to the operation, maintenance and storage of the aircraft, including paying for fuel, maintenance costs and storage fees and obtaining the services of pilots for our LPs operation of the aircraft when used by us. JRC Citation, LLC is obligated to maintain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance on the aircraft. We have agreed to defend and indemnify JRC Citation, LLC and its shareholders, members, directors, officers, managers and employees against any claims, damages or liabilities arising from our operation, maintenance, storage or other use of the aircraft. Shared employees Certain of our employees performed services for companies owned by Mr. Crane. We were reimbursed for these services based upon an allocation percentage of total salaries agreed to by us and Mr. Crane. We received reimbursements of $80,000, $136,000 and $135,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no amounts billed but not received as of December 31, 2006. Relatives of EGL Executive Officers and Directors Robert Kelley is the brother of Neil Kelley, a member of our Board of Directors. Robert Kelley is a logistics manager for our company and received total compensation of $89,000 in 2006. Patrick Bento is the brother of E. Joseph Bento, President of North America and CMO. Patrick Bento is a global account director for our company and received total compensation of $374,000 in 2006. Dan Getty is the brother in law of E. Joseph Bento. Dan Getty is the managing director of one of our stations and received total compensation of $151,000 in 2006. Seasonality Historically, our operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. Typically, our first fiscal quarter is weaker when compared to our other fiscal quarters of the corresponding year. The seasonality of our business is a result of a variety of factors, including holiday seasons, consumer demand, economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor. As a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods. 43 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. Among the factors, but not fully inclusive of all factors that may be considered by management in these processes are: the range of accounting policies permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; managements understanding of the companys business both historical results and expected future results; expectations of the future performance of the economy domestically, globally and within various sectors that serve our principal customers and suppliers of goods and services; expected rates of change, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates; and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process often times may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that lies within that range of reasonable estimates which may result in the selection of estimates that may be viewed as conservative or aggressive by others based upon the quantity, quality and risks associated with the variability that might be expected from the future outcome and the factors considered in developing the estimate. Management attempts to use its business and financial accounting judgment in selecting the most appropriate estimate; however, actual amounts could and will differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition Domestic revenues and most domestic operating costs are recognized when shipments are picked up from the customer. International revenues and freight consolidation costs are recognized in the period when shipments are tendered to a carrier for transport to a foreign destination. This is one of the permissible methods under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 91 9, Revenue and Expense Recognition for Freight Services in Process. This method generally results in recognition of revenues and gross profit earlier than methods that do not recognize revenues until a proof of delivery is received. This method of revenue and cost recognition does not result in a material difference than if revenues and costs were recognized upon delivery. Customs brokerage and other revenues are recognized upon completing the documents necessary for customs clearance or completing other fee based services. Revenues recognized as an indirect air carrier or an ocean freight consolidator include the direct carriers charges to EGL for carrying the shipment. Revenues recognized in other capacities include only the commissions and fees received. We report the costs of certain reimbursed incidental activities on a gross basis in revenues and cost of transportation. We derive our revenues from three principal sources: air freight forwarding, ocean freight forwarding, and customs brokerage, import and logistics services. Air and ocean freight forwarding. As primarily a non asset based carrier, we do not own transportation assets. Instead, we generate the majority of our air and ocean freight revenues by 44 purchasing transportation services from direct (asset based) carriers and reselling those services to our customers as an indirect carrier. Additionally, we generate air freight and ocean freight forwarding revenues to a lesser extent as an authorized cargo sales agent. As an indirect carrier, we obtain shipments from our customers, consolidate shipments bound for a particular destination, determine the routing, select the direct carrier and tender each consolidated lot as a single shipment to the direct carrier for transportation to a distribution point. We issue a House Airway Bill (HAWB) or a House Ocean Bill of Lading (HOBL) to customers as the contract of carriage. In turn, when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier, we receive a contract of carriage known as a Master Airway Bill for air freight shipments and a Master Ocean Bill of Lading for ocean shipments. We are the direct point of contact for service fulfillment and resolving any service failures or claims for lost or damaged freight resulting from either our or the direct carriers actions. In addition, if we do not collect from our customers, we are still responsible for paying the direct carrier. Due to the high volume of freight we manage, we generally obtain lower rates from the direct carriers than the rates we charge our customers for individual shipments. This rate differential is the primary source of our air and ocean freight net revenues. We have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. We select the direct carrier that will provide the most economical routing in an effort to maximize net revenues. Revenues related to shipments where we act as an indirect carrier are reported based on the gross amount billed to the customer and include the charges for carrying the shipments. Based upon the terms in the contract of carriage, revenues are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin. Costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this time. As an authorized cargo sales agent of most airlines and ocean shipping lines, we also arrange for transportation of individual shipments and receive a commission from the airline or ocean shipping line for arranging the shipments. When acting in this capacity, we do not consolidate shipments or have responsibility for shipments once they have been tendered to the carrier. Therefore, revenues include only the commissions and fees received. These revenues are recognized upon completion of the services. Customs brokerage, import and logistics services. Customs brokerage and import services involve providing services at destinations, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery. We also offer a range of logistics services, distribution and materials management services, international insurance services, global project management services and trade facilitation services. Revenues include the fees received for these services and are recognized upon completion of the services. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors based on the expected ultimate recovery of trade receivables. We maintain a bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, general and specific economic trends, significant one time events and historical customer collection experience. Also, we record additional reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position. Trade receivables include disbursements made by us on behalf of our customers for transportation costs and customs duties. As the billings to customers for these disbursements may be several times the amount of revenues and fees derived from these transactions, the inability to collect such amounts could result in losses greater than the revenues 45 recognized when such billings were recorded. If circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts would be further adjusted. Computer software Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The following types of costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software, (ii) payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use software project, (iii) interest costs incurred in developing software for internal use, and (iv) costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion of old data into new systems. Costs related to the preliminary project stage, data conversion and the post implementation/operation stage of a software development proje ct are expensed as incurred. On retirement or sale of assets, the cost of such assets and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss, if any, is credited or charged to income. We have incurred substantial costs during the periods presented related to a number of information systems projects that were being developed over that time period. Inherent in the capitalization of those projects are the assumptions that after considering the technological and business issues related to their development, such development efforts will be successfully completed and that benefits to be provided by the completed projects will exceed the costs capitalized to develop the systems. Management believes that all projects capitalized at December 31, 2006 will be successfully completed and will result in benefits recoverable in future periods. Goodwill and other intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is a residual amount and is determined after numerous estimates are made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities included in a business combination, and therefore, indirectly affected by managements estimates and judgments. We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We use a two step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, good will is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference. The income approach, which we use to estimate the fair value of our reporting units is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends; forecasted revenue, costs, cash flows and capital expenditures, and the timing thereof; appropriate discount rates; tax rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain assumptions to allocate shared assets, liabilities and overhead costs to calculate the carrying values for each of our reporting units. We performed our annual 2006 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2006. Based on the present value of our estimated future cash flows, we concluded that the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our South America reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit. As such, we performed the second step of the impairment analysis and 46 concluded that all of the recorded goodwill of $3.8 million was impaired and needed to be expensed as a component of operating income. This impairment charge is recorded as a component of general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We may incur charges for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the future if the net book value of our operating reporting units exceeds estimated fair value. If we incur additional impairment, it could have an adverse impact on our future earnings. Impairment of assets Substantial judgment is necessary in the determination as to whether an event or circumstance has occurred that may trigger an impairment analysis and in determination of the related cash flows from the asset. Estimating cash flows related to long lived assets is a difficult and subjective process that applies historical experience and future business expectations to revenues and related operating costs of assets. Should impairment appear to be necessary, subjective judgment must be applied to estimate the fair value of the asset, for which there may be no ready market, which oftentimes results in the use of discounted cash flow analysis and judgmental selection of discount rates to be used in the discounting process. If we determine an asset has been impaired based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or the business unit over the remaining amortization period, and if the cash flow analysis indicates that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds related undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value of the asset or the present value of the expected future cash flows. Merger and restructuring We have engaged in merger and restructuring actions that require our management to utilize significant estimates related to future lease obligations for duplicate facilities, expenses for severance and other employee separation costs and costs for termination of joint venture/agency agreements. Management makes significant estimates, including the amount of sublease income we will recover for future lease obligations on duplicate facilities. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. See note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Taxes on earnings A companys income tax expense (benefit) for financial reporting purposes is equal to the current tax expense (i.e. amounts due per the income tax return) plus the deferred tax expense. Deferred tax expense (benefit) is the change during the year in the companys deferred tax liabilities and assets. We use the balance sheet approach as prescribed by Financial Accounting Standard 109 (FAS 109) to measure the cumulative temporary differences and carryforward amounts at the applicable tax rate thereby determining the deferred tax asset and liability balances. The deferred tax assets are then analyzed for potential valuation allowances where future tax benefits may not be realized. We identify and measure all temporary differences, net operating loss carryforward amounts and tax credit carryforward balances to determine the total deferred tax asset and liability amounts at the applicable rate. We consider all positive and negative factors when evaluating the need for valuation allowances such as historical performance, future earnings forecasts and net operating and credit carryforward utilization by jurisdiction before expiration. Where such factors do not indicate full realization of the deferred tax asset a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the expected deferred tax benefit. The charge to earnings is recorded in the period such determination is made. When future positive events occur, the valuation allowance will be revised or eliminated. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes have been provided because such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely outside the U.S. Material changes in our estimates of cash flow, working capital and long term 47 investment requirements could impact our effective rate should the repatriation of such offshore earnings become necessary. As discussed in note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns from fiscal years 2000 to 2001 are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Specifically, the income tax returns filed by EGL, Inc. for fiscal years ended September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2001, and the final income tax return filed by Circle International Group, Inc., a subsidiary of EGL, Inc., for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2000 when it was a separate company prior to the merger with EGL, Inc. are currently under audit. The case has been with the Appeals division of the IRS since June 2005. In December 2006, the Company reached a settlement agreement with the IRS Appeals team in this case. As a result of the settlement the Company will capitalize a portion of software research and de velopment expenditures for fiscal year September 30, 2001. The Company also will capitalize a portion of merger transaction costs for the short period Circle International Group, Inc. return ended October 2, 2000. Under the settlement terms the Company estimates it will pay approximately $2.4 million in additional taxes when the case is closed. Additionally, the Company will recognize an estimated deferred tax benefit of $2.9 million related to temporary items that will be recovered in future periods. The case must be reviewed by the Joint Committee of Congress which the Company expects to occur by the end of second quarter 2007. While the outcome of review cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe any additional material adjustments to its tax returns are probable at this time. There can be no assurance that the final outcome will not result in material adjustments which would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. The case can be formally closed once Joint Committee review is complete. New accounting pronouncements We discuss new accounting pronouncements in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our cash flows and net income are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates. We attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through operational actions. We provide services to customers in locations throughout the world and, as a result, operate with many functional currencies including the key currencies of North America, Latin America, Asia, the South Pacific and Europe. This diverse base of local currency costs serves to partially counterbalance the effect of potential changes in the value of our local currency denominated revenues and expenses. Short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions. The duration of these exposures is minimized through the use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles the majority of inter company obligations two times per month. We use short term foreign exchange forward contracts on a limited basis to minimize exposures to exchange rates on recorded receivables and payables. The value of foreign exchange forward contracts was not significant at December 31, 2006 or 2005. In October 2005, we issued $100 million of floating rate, senior secured notes due in October 2012. The notes have a variable LIBOR based interest rate. See note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $37.0 million outstanding under our line of credit. Our lease payments on certain financed facilities are tied to market interest rates. At December 31, 2006, a 10% rise in the base rate for these financing arrangements would not have a material impact on operating income in 2007. We have not purchased any material futures contracts nor have we purchased or held any material derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during 2006. In November 2005, we entered into a 48 three year interest rate swap agreement, which was designated as a cash flow hedge, to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our $300 million LIBOR based revolving credit facility or any substitutive debt agreements we enter into. The fair value of the interest rate swap at December 31, 2006 was a gain of $188,000. The fair value of the interest rate swap at December 31, 2005 was a loss of $301,000, of which $94,000 has been recognized as interest expense. The interest rate swap expires in January 2009.
