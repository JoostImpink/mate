Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview IRIDEX Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of therapeutic based laser systems and delivery devices used to treat eye diseases in ophthalmology and skin conditions in dermatology (aesthetics). Our products are sold in the United States predominantly through a direct sales force and internationally through 77 independent distributors into 107 countries. Total product sales in 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $35.9 million, $37.0 million, and $32.8 million respectively. Our revenues arise primarily from the sale of our IRIS Medical OcuLight Systems, IQ810 lasers, VariLite, DioLite 532 systems, delivery devices, disposables and revenues from service and support activities. Our current family of OcuLight systems includes the IRIS Medical OcuLight Symphony, OcuLight SL, OcuLight SLx, OcuLight TX, OcuLight GL and OcuLight GLx laser photocoagulation systems as well as the IQ810 laser. In 2006 at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) we introduced two new ophthalmic products; the OcuLight TX, a new green light laser with an optional remote control and wireless footswitch which first shipped in late 2006 and the first true yellow 577 nm laser system which is currently scheduled to ship in the second half of 2007 once FDA approval has been obtained. We also produce the Millennium Endolase module which is sold exclusively to Bausch Lomb and incorporated into their Millennium Microsurgical System. We believe that our future growth in revenue will be based upon the successful implementation of our strategy in these areas: 1) leveraging our core business and increasing recurring revenues, 2) broadening our product lines through product innovation, and 3) developing new market opportunities through strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our business includes a recurring revenue component which includes the sale of our disposable single use laser probes, EndoProbes, combined with the repair, servicing and extended warranty protection for our laser systems. In 2006, recurring revenues were 43% of the overall business up from 36% in 2005 and 33% in 2004. With our new sales and marketing programs, combined with having sold more than 8,300 IRIDEX laser systems worldwide, we believe that there is an opportunity to significantly increase our recurring revenues over the next several years. Our new sales programs include an increase in the number of our domestic area sales managers from 10 to 12 focused on the entire ophthalmic product offering with emphasis in their incentive plan on the recurring revenue opportunity. Our new marketing programs include a VIP (Valued IRIDEX Partner) program which allows customers to access additional IRIDEX products through a contractual agreement on the purchase of disposable laser probes. During the past two years, we have introduced many different types of EndoProbes into the market, including our new stepped, intuitive and illuminating probes. Sales to international distributors are made on open credit terms or letters of credit. Sales of our products internationally are currently denominated in United States dollars and, accordingly, are not subject to risks associated with international monetary conditions and currency fluctuations. Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing components and sub systems, assembling, packaging, shipping and testing components at our facility, and direct labor and associated overhead. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, materials and research support provided to clinicians at medical institutions developing new applications which utilize our products. Research and development costs have been expensed as incurred. Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of personnel, sales commissions, travel expenses, advertising and promotional expenses, facilities cost, legal and accounting fees, insurance and other expenses not allocated to other departments. Results of Operations 2006, 2005 and 2004 Revenue: Revenue by source for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue: Opthalmology Domestic $ 18,184 $ 17,762 $ 16,443 Opthalmology International 12,641 12,900 11,310 Total Opthalmology 30,826 30,663 27,753 Dermatology Domestic 3,641 4,951 3,451 Dermatology International 1,437 1,415 1,606 Total Dermatology 5,078 6,366 5,057 Total Revenue $ 35,904 $ 37,029 $ 32,810 40 Table of Contents Ophthalmology and Dermatology Revenue. We manage and evaluate our business in two major segments Ophthalmology and Dermatology. We then further break down these major segments by geography Domestic (United States) and International (the rest of the world). Total revenue in 2006 declined to $35.9 million from $37 million in 2005, a $1.1 million or 3.0% decrease. The decrease resulted from Dermatology sales in the domestic segment which declined $1.3 million or 26.5%. Changes in the composition of the selling force in the first half of the year significantly contributed to this decrease Dermatology international sales were essentially flat from 2005 levels. Overall, Dermatology sales in both segments declined by $1.3 million, a 20.2% decrease. Ophthalmology sales in the domestic segment increased $0.4 million or 2.4% in 2006 from 2005. This increase in domestic ophthalmology revenue was offset by a decrease in OEM revenue from 2005 levels which reflected a large one time OEM order. Ophthalmology international sales declined $0.2 million in 2006, a 2% decrease due to a decline of approximately $1.0 million in sales to end customers in China and Hong Kong offset by strength in international sales in Europe and other parts of the world. Overall Ophthalmology sales growth was $0.2 million or 0.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. Total Revenue in 2005 increased by $4.2 million over 2004, a 13% increase. In 2005, ophthalmology sales increased 10.5% to $30.7 million from $27.8 million in 2004. Domestic ophthalmology sales increased 8% to $17.8 million in 2005 from $16.4 million in 2004. Domestic ophthalmology sales increased during this period mainly as a result of $1.2 million in increased unit sales of visible lasers, $0.5 million in increased service revenue, $0.1 million in increased unit sales of delivery devices offset by $0.4 million in decreased unit sales of infrared lasers and $0.2 million in decreased average selling prices. International ophthalmology sales increased 14.1% to $12.9 million from $11.3 million in 2004. The increase in international sales was due primarily to a $1.2 million increase in unit sales of visible laser consoles, $0.4 million in increased delivery device sales, $0.2 million in increased average selling prices and $0.1 million in increased international ophthalmology service revenue offset by a $0.5 million decrease in unit sales of infrared lasers. Dermatology sales increased 25.9% in 2005 to $6.4 million from $5.1 million in 2004. Domestic dermatology sales increased 43.5% to $5.0 million in 2005 from $3.5 million in 2004. The increase in domestic dermatology sales was due primarily to $2.4 million in increased unit sales of the VariLite laser, $0.1 million in unit sales of the new DioLite XP laser and $0.2 million in increased domestic dermatology service revenue offset by $0.7 million in decreased unit sales of the DioLite laser and $0.5 million in sales of the Apex hair removal laser which was discontinued in 2005. International dermatology sales decreased 11.9% to $1.4 million in 2005 from $1.6 million in 2004. The decrease in international dermatology sales was due to a $0.9 million decrease in unit sales of the Apex hair removal laser which was discontinued in 2005 offset by a $0.7 million increase in unit sales of the VariLite laser. We expect revenues to increase primarily due to the acquisition of the assets of the aesthetics business of Laserscope. Gross Margin: Gross profit was $18.8 million in 2006, $18.2 million in 2005 and $14.9 million in 2004. Gross margin represented 52.4% of sales in 2006, 49.1% of sales in 2005 and 45.4% of sales in 2004. The 3.3% increase in gross profit in 2006 was primarily due to a decrease in warranty reserves due to a change in the duration of our standard warranty, which was reduced from three years to one year and a benefit due to the sale of previously reserved inventory. In addition gross margin was positively impacted by a slight improvement in overall average selling prices. The 3.7% increase in gross profit in 2005 from 2004 resulted from a 1.9% decrease in direct costs combined with a 1.8% decrease in overhead spending. Additional factors having a positive impact on gross margin include the mix impact of the increase in disposable laser probe revenue and some OEM revenues which may not be repeatable. We believe gross profit in dollars will likely increase as unit volumes increase and unit production costs decrease by improved design and production efficiencies. Overall, however, gross margins as a percentage of sales will continue to fluctuate due to changes in the relative proportions of domestic and international sales, the product mix of sales, costs associated with future product introductions and the manufacturing transition of the Laserscope products and a variety of other factors. See Factors That May Affect Future Results Our Operating Results May Fluctuate from Quarter to Quarter and Year to Year. Research and Development. Research and development includes the cost of research and product innovation efforts. Research and product innovation expenses increased by 31.4% to $5.5 million in 2006 from $4.2 million in 2005. The increase in spending in 2006 related to increased project spending of $0.5 million associated with increased development efforts, $0.4 million of increased salary and benefit expense associated with increased headcount including expenses for consulting and temporary help and stock compensation expense of $0.3 million recorded in 2006. Research and product innovation expenses decreased by 7.0% in 2005 to $4.2 million from $4.5 million in 2004. The decrease in 2005, consisted of a $0.2 million decrease in project spending and $0.1 million in decreased clinical spending. The decrease in project spending in 2005 was primarily driven by completion of development of the VariLite and IQ810 lasers in 2004. Total research and development expenses were 15.3% of net sales in 2006, 11.3% of net sales in 2005 and 13.7% of net sales in 2004. The decrease in research and product innovation expense, as a percentage of net sales in 2005 was attributable to the decrease in research and product innovation spending in that year due to completion of certain products. We expect to target our level of research and development spend at approximately 10% of our revenues in future periods to maintain a consistent level of new product introductions. 41 Table of Contents Sales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative expense increased in 2006 by 48.4% to $18.1 million from $12.2 million in 2005. General and administrative expenses increased $4.0 million in 2006 due to $2.4 million in increased legal spending related to litigation, $1.0 million in stock compensation expense, $0.2 million in increased business development spending and $0.5 million in professional and legal fees associated with an internal investigation of our revenue recognition policy and resulting financial restatement. Selling expenses increased 21.4% or $1.1 million in 2006. This increase was largely related to increased salary and benefit expense and recruiting expense of $0.8 million related to increased sales headcount. In addition, selling expense was increased for charges related to demonstration units used in the sales process of $0.1 million and increased bad debt expense of $0.1 million. Marketing expense increased $0.8 million in 2006. This increase was due to increased salary and benefit expense of $0.3 million associated with increased headcount, $0.2 million of stock compensation expense, and $0.3 million in increased advertising and trade show expenses. We expect sales, general and administrative expense to increase in the first half of 2007 due to ongoing legal spending related to litigation and increased consulting fees associated with the Laserscope integration. Sales, general and administrative expense increased by 6.3% in 2005 to $12.2 million from $11.5 million in 2004. The increase in 2005 was driven by an increase of $0.3 million in marketing spending, $0.2 million in increased selling expenses and $0.2 million in increased general and administrative costs. The increase in marketing spending was primarily related to spending on trade shows, advertising and consulting. The increase in selling expense was due mainly to increased sales headcount and related expenses. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to spending related to the hiring of a new Chief Executive Officer as well as increased consulting, legal expenses and public company expenses offset by a one time $1.0 million charge to establish a reserve for unpaid sales tax in 2004. These expenses were 32.9% of sales in 2005 and 34.9% of sales in 2004. The decrease, as a percentage of net sales, from 2004 to 2005, was attributable to the level of increase in sales, general and administrative expense relative to the increase in the level of sales. Interest and Other income, net. Other income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on available for sales securities. Interest income was $736,000, $534,000 and $249,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. Interest income increased in 2006 over 2005 and 2005 over 2004 based on higher average cash balances and increased interest rates in 2006 and 2005. We do not expect to earn interest income in the future and instead expect to incur interest expense related to our new credit facilities. Income Taxes Significant components affecting the effective tax rate include pre tax net income or loss, changes in valuation allowance, federal and state RD tax credits, income from tax exempt securities, the state composite tax rate and recognition of certain deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance. We recorded a tax provision of $1.7 million in 2006 resulting from the establishment of a valuation allowance with respect of our deferred tax assets based on our past losses and uncertainty regarding our ability to project taxable income. Our tax provision for 2005 was $0.7 million based upon a 28% annual effective tax rate. This rate was calculated based on a statutory tax rate benefited by RD tax credits and state tax benefits. We recorded a tax benefit in 2004 of $0.4 million. The 2004 tax rate resulted primarily from a small pre tax loss benefited by RD tax credits. In 2007 we do not anticipate recording a tax provision until we determine it is appropriate to revise the valuation allowance. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our recent and current operating performance has not met our expectations, primarily as a result of our inability to realize the full benefits of the acquisition of the aesthetics business of Laserscope in our previously anticipated time frame, as well as recent negative cash flows from operations. In particular, revenues from the aesthetics business have been below our expectations. Our ability to realize the potential benefits of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the aesthetics business. As expected, our efforts towards integrating the aesthetics business of Laserscope has and will continue to take a significant amount of time and place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources, and may continue to be more difficult and expensive than originally anticipated. This continued diversion of our managements attention and any additional delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the aesthetics business will harm our operating results and increase the difficulty of our being able to satisfy our liquidity requirements. We do not believe that our current liquidity and capital resources, cash expected to be generated from operations and our ability to draw down on our credit facilities, if at all, will be sufficient to meet our currently planned operating requirements for the next 12 months. Our concerns about our ability to satisfy our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months are primarily a result of our current operating performance relative to plan, as well as our continuing losses, negative cash flows and current liquidity in relation to future obligations, including our obligation to make a payment in October 2007 to Laserscope for the purchase of certain inventory under our Supply Agreement we entered into with American Medical Systems Holdings in connection with the acquisition of the aesthetics business of Laserscope and our expected inability to satisfy certain covenants under our loan agreement with Mid Peninsula Bank, part of Greater Bay Bank N.A., and the Export Import Bank as of March 31, 2007. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an opinion in connection with their audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 which stated, that there was substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 42 Table of Contents In addition, we currently expect that our operating performance for our first fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2007 will result in our not being able to satisfy certain current restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities with Mid Peninsula Bank and the Export Import Bank, and if we default on these credit facilities and the lenders exercise their remedies, this will further contribute to the difficulties we expect to face in meeting our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. Our obligations under these credit facilities are secured by a lien on substantially all of the Companys assets. Each of these credit facilities contain certain customary covenants which require the Company to maintain profitability beginning in our second fiscal quarter of 2007 and to meet certain tangible net worth and debt service requirements. In addition, we must maintain $3.0 million in restricted cash at all times when borrowings are outstanding. We currently have drawn down $11.4 million under this credit facility which is the full amount currently available, and, given our current financial status, we currently do not expect to be able to satisfy the restrictive covenants relating to these facilities as of March 31, 2007. In the event of default by the Company with the covenants under these facilities, Mid Peninsula Bank and the Export Import Bank, would be entitled to exercise their remedies, under these facilities, which include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable and disposing of the collateral if obligations were not paid. We have initiated discussions with a view toward restructuring these credit facilities to enable us to come into compliance with applicable covenants; however, we cannot assure you that these discussions will be successful. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II of this report for more information regarding these credit facilities. In order to address our liquidity issues, we plan to, among other things: (i) work towards integrating the aesthetics business as quickly and efficiently as possible and maximizing the potential benefits that may be realized from the acquisition, (ii) modify our planned operations in order to increase our cash flows from operations, (iii) seek to restructure our credit facilities, and (iv) raise additional capital through equity or debt financing in order to enhance our liquidity. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts or that any additional capital raised through debt or equity financings will be available on favorable terms or at all. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, we may have to suspend or cease operations or significantly dilute our stockholders equity holdings. Net cash used by operations in 2006 totaled $1.5 million. This resulted largely from a net loss of $5.7 million an increase in net inventories of $0.9 million, offset by $3.2 million associated with the recording of a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset and non cash stock compensation expense recorded during the year of $1.8 million. Cash provided by investing activities was $8.3 million due to the conversion of available for sale securities into cash and cash equivalents in anticipation of closing the acquisition of the aesthetics business of Laserscope in January 2007. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 million related to the issuance of stock in connection with our employee stock purchase programs. Net cash generated by operations in 2005 totaled $2.8 million. The primary sources of cash in 2005 included net income of $1.7 million, a decrease in net accounts receivable of $0.8 million due to a decrease in days sales outstanding and an increase in deferred income taxes of $0.6 million. Uses of cash in 2005 consisted mainly of a decrease in accrued expenses of $0.7 million due to payments in 2005 against a sales tax reserve offset by increased bonus accruals for 2005. We used $1.5 million for investing activities in 2005 primarily due to the purchase of available for sale securities and the acquisition of capital assets. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 million from the issuance of stock in connection with our employee stock purchase programs. Net cash generated by operations in 2004 totaled $0.8 million and consisted mainly of an increase in net accrued expenses and accounts payable of $2.0 million due primarily to a reserve for sales tax and associated consulting as well as payroll accruals related to the timing of payroll, depreciation of $0.4 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $0.3 million based on increased sales of extended warranty contracts offset by an increase in net accounts receivable of $0.8 million related mainly to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase in the deferred tax asset of $0.6 million, a net loss of $0.4 million and an increase in inventory of $0.2 million associated with inventory purchased in connection with new product introductions. We used $2.3 million for investing activities in 2004 primarily due to the purchase of available for sale securities and the acquisition of capital assets. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 million from the issuance of stock in connection with our employee stock purchase programs. Our contractual payment obligations that were fixed and determinable as of December 30, 2006 were as follows: Payments Due by Period 2011 and Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 thereafter Contractual Obligations Operating Leases $ 983 $ 438 $ 451 $ 94 $ 0 $ 0 Unconditional Purchase Obligations* $ 1,472 $ 1,472 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 2,455 $ 1,910 $ 451 $ 94 $ 0 $ 0 * Related to the acquisition of the aesthetics business of AMS in January 2007, we have agreed to purchase up to $9.0 million worth of certain inventory from AMS book value, following the termination of our Product Supply Agreement with AMS no later than October 2007. Principal payments under the term loans entered into in conjunction with the acquisition are $98,000 per month over a term of 5 years. 43 Table of Contents The following annual operating lease commitments as of January 17, 2007 were acquired as part of the acquisition of the French and UK subsidiaries of Laserscope. 2007 $ 328 2008 224 2009 145 2010 33 $ 730 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, net sales and expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our revenues arise from the sale of laser consoles, delivery devices, disposables and service and support activities. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured. Shipments are generally made with Free On Board (FOB) shipping point terms, whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock. Any shipments with FOB receiving point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point. Up front fees received in connection with product sales are deferred and recognized over the associated product shipments. Revenue relating to extended warrant contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable warranty contract. We recognize repair service revenue upon completion of the work. Cost is recognized as product sales revenue is recognized. The Companys sales may include post sales obligations for training or other deliverables. When these obligations are fulfilled after product shipment, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the multiple element accounting guidance set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. When the Company has objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements, it defers revenue attributable to the post sale obligations and recognizes such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled. Otherwise, the Company defers all revenue related to the transaction until all elements are delivered. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include on hand inventory, sales demo inventory and service loaner inventory. Cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in, first out (FIFO) method. Lower of cost or market is evaluated by considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory, deterioration and other factors. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, are made for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired inventory and are charged to cost of goods sold. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates. Sales Returns Allowance and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the process of preparing financial statements we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Specifically, we estimate future product returns related to current period product revenue. We analyze historical returns, and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance and other allowances. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates. The provision for sales returns amounted to $0.2 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004. Similarly our management must make estimates regarding the uncollectability of our accounts receivable. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non payment by customers to the extent of amounts recorded on the balance sheet. As of December 30, 2006, we had accounts receivable totaling $6.1 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.4 million. As sales levels increase the level of accounts receivable would likely also increase. In the event that customers were to delay their payments to us, the levels of accounts receivable would likely also increase. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on past payment history with the customer, analysis of the customers current financial condition, the aging of the accounts receivable balance, customer concentration and other known factors. 44 Table of Contents Warranty The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products. Actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued. The Companys warranty policy is applicable to products which are considered defective in their performance or fail to meet the product specifications. Warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of sales. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Under SFAS No. 109, the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. In the quarter ended December 30, 2006 we recorded a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on our past losses and uncertainty regarding our ability to project future taxable income. In future periods if we are able to generate income we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors, including employee non qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock units and employee purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP Shares) based on estimated fair values. SFAS 123(R) supersedes previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) for periods beginning in fiscal year 2006. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) providing supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS 123(R). We have applied the provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income. We adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method which requires the application of the accounting standard starting from January 1, 2006, the first day of our fiscal year 2006. Our consolidated financial statements, as of and for the year ended December 30, 2006, reflect the impact of SFAS 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method we used in adopting SFAS 123(R), our results of operations prior to fiscal year 2006 have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123(R). Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 and FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for our fixed cost stock option plans because stock based awards were issued at fair market value on the date of grant Stock based compensation expense recognized in the year ended December 30, 2006, included stock based compensation expense for share based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123, and stock based compensation expense for the share based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense from the accelerated multiple option method (for the purposes of non GAAP information under SFAS 123) to the straight line single option method. Stock based compensation expense for all share based awards granted on or prior to December 31, 2005 will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach, while stock based compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to December 30, 2005 will be recognized using the straight line single option method. SFAS 123(R) requires that we recognize expense for awards ultimately expected to vest; therefore we are required to develop an estimate of the number of awards expected to cancel prior to vesting (forfeiture rate). The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical pre vest cancellation experience and is applied to all share based awards. SFAS 123(R) requires the forfeiture rate to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Prior to fiscal year 2006, we accounted for forfeitures as they actually occurred. Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), we selected the Black Scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options and ESPP Shares. The Black Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards, including the options expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. For restricted stock or restricted stock units, stock based compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. 45 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN 48 in our year ended December 29, 2007. We do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of FIN 48 will materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations. On September 13, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The guidance became effective for our fiscal year 2006. Our adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements under GAAP. The changes to current practice resulting from the application of SFAS 157 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 will materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates. Although limited, our exposure to market risk in the areas of changes in United States and foreign interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates are measured against the United States dollar. These exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents, available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements. At December 30, 2006, we had no available for sale securities. Our primary interest rate exposure relates to the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations. We have no debt outstanding at December 30, 2006. Currently, the majority of our revenue is denominated in United States dollars. Increases in the value of the United States dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region, leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region. As we continue to expand our international sales, we expect our non United States dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions to increase due to our acquisition of two European subsidiaries as part of our acquisition of the assets of the aesthetics business of Laserscope. We currently do not engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of the currency fluctuation, but we may do so in the future.
