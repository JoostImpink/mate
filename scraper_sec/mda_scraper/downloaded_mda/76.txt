Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General The Companys principal source of revenue is derived from providing processing and support services to securities brokerage affiliates of banks, other financial institutions and broker dealers. Net revenues principally include processing and support fees, margin interest, commissions and other miscellaneous fees which are ancillary to customer securities transactions, less interest expense. The major non interest expenses incurred by the Company relate to employees compensation and benefits and other direct costs of processing and support services, such as floor brokerage and clearing charges, occupancy and equipment costs and other operating expenses. Although the Companys business cannot be characterized as seasonal, retail brokerage activity is typically, but not always, slower in the summer months of June, July and August. Reduced transaction volume generally results in reduced levels of processing and support service fees and commission revenues. Variations in transaction volume may cause the Companys operating results to fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis. During 1996 and 1995, business conditions related to the provision of processing and support services to the securities brokerage affiliates of banks and other financial institutions were favorably impacted by stable short term interest rates which helped increase the activity in both the equity and mutual fund markets. The financial services industry is currently undergoing increased consolidation. If any of the banks or other financial institutions processing brokerage transactions through BHC Securities, Inc. ("BHC") were to consolidate, such consolidation might result in an increase, decrease or no change in the use of BHCs processing and support services depending on whether and the extent to which the surviving consolidated entity continues its relationship with BHC. From time to time, BHCs Clients may also review the possibility of internalizing their securities brokerage processing functions. BHC attempts to mitigate the risk of loss by entering into longer term contracts with larger Clients, providing superior products and services at "cost effective" prices and developing software and systems for Clients that meet their specific needs. BHC markets to prospective Clients on a continuing basis and added ten new Clients in 1996. BHC lost three clients in 1996. While BHC recently expanded its marketing plan to target broker dealers and investment advisors not affiliated with financial institutions, it continues to market to large financial institutions and a significant portion of its revenues are dependent on approximately fifteen large financial institutions. (See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) As previously disclosed in prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, three Clients of BHC have notified BHC of their intentions to internalize their securities processing brokerage function. These Clients 15 accounted for 31% of BHCs 1996 total revenues. It is anticipated that NISI will terminate its clearing agreement with BHC in the third quarter of 1997, USAA in the fourth quarter of 1997 and CIS at the end of the second quarter of 1998. While these events will have an adverse financial impact on the Company, the amount can not be quantified in advance due to the variable nature of the securities processing business. BHC will continue to intensify its effort to broaden its client base and markets and to diversify its security processing business. It is anticipated that over time, the loss of these clients will be replaced by new clients and the growth of existing clients. See Item 1. The Company Dependence on Key Clients. Subsequent Event Merger of the Company On March 2, 1997, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Fiserv, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Fiserv Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Fiserv Sub will be merged into the Company, and the Company will be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiserv. At the Effective Time, the Company will change its name to "Fiserv Clearing, Inc." It is presently contemplated that the Effective Time will be May 30, 1997 or shortly thereafter. Fiserv, headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin, is an independent provider of financial data processing systems and related information management services and products to more than 5,000 banks, credit unions, mortgage firms and savings institutions worldwide. The common stock of Fiserv is traded on The Nasdaq National Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock MarketSM under the symbol "FISV." Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of the Companys Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive such number of shares of Fiserv Common Stock as shall equal the Conversion Ratio, which is defined as the quotient of (x) $33.50 divided by (y) an amount equal to the average closing price of Fiserv Common Stock as reported in The Wall Street Journal for the 20 trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the Effective Time. The Merger has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both the Company and Fiserv and is subject to approval by the Companys stockholders as well as receipt of all required regulatory and other approvals. The obligations of Fiserv and the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent waivable) of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. In the event that Fiserv reasonably determines that the Merger would be accounted for as a pooling of interests in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, then, subject to the others terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger will be consummated. In the event that Fiserv reasonably determines that the Merger cannot be accounted for as a pooling of interests, then, subject to the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the merger will be consummated and will be accounted for as a purchase, providing that the merger consideration will be adjusted by modifying the definition of Conversion Ratio such that $33.50 is replaced with $31.50. 16 It is anticipated that the Merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16. Because of the recent purchases by the Company of its Common Stock, the Company may be required, among other things, to sell approximately 200,000 shares of its Common Stock (either through the exercise of stock options or by a stock offering to unrelated parties) prior to the Effective Time in order for the Merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. As part of the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue and sell such shares after the date of the special meeting of the stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement, and prior to the consummation of the Merger, to the extent necessary to satisfy such condition. Important Factors Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements regarding the Companys expectations as to its future operations and financial condition and certain other information presented in this Annual Report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations. Factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include a general downturn in the economy or the stock markets and the related transaction activity, substantial changes in interest rates, the gain or loss of significant customers, unforeseen new competition, changes in government policy or regulation and unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings. Results of Operations The Companys revenues are directly affected by the income derived from its processing and support services. Such revenues are affected by both the transaction volume of accounts and the level of, and interest rate charged on, customer margin debit balances. The information in the table below should be considered when reading the discussion and analysis of operating results that follow the table. Percentage Change For the Year Ended December 31, 1996 1995 Year Ended December 31, Compared Compared 1996 1995 1994 to 1995 to 1994 Total transactions (in thousands) 2,239 1,665 1,383 34% 20% Daily average transactions processed 8,813 6,606 5,487 33% 20% Number of active accounts at end of period (in thousands)(1) 1,125 1,075 916 5% 17% Average margin debit balances (in millions) $ 379 $ 322 $ 316 18% 2% Average broker call rate 7.03% 7.58% 5.94% (1) Active accounts are generally those that have positions or have had brokerage processing activity during the previous 18 months. 17 1996 Compared with 1995 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996 reached $81.2 million which was $15.5 million, or 24%, greater than the $65.7 million generated for the year ended December 31, 1995. The increases were the result of increases in processing and support service fees, net interest income, commissions and other income. Processing and support service fees increased to $50.6 million for 1996 from $42.5 million in 1995, a 19% increase. The increase was due to increased transaction volume of 34% for the period. The financial results of 1996 reflect the loss of three Clients during the year which was offset by transactions from new clients signed late in 1995 and throughout 1996. The average revenue per ticket declined by $2.94, or 12%, in 1996 when compared to 1995. Generally in periods where daily transaction volumes are increasing, revenue will increase, while processing and support service revenue per ticket will decline. This is due to BHCs volume discount program which rewards Clients for high transaction volumes by reducing the charge per transaction when various volume levels are achieved. In addition, the Company faces pressure on profit margins as Clients become larger due to the threat of Clients internalizing their brokerage processing and support functions and due to general pricing pressure from increased market competition. Net interest income (margin interest income and other interest income less interest expense) increased to $16.6 million in 1996 from $13.7 million in 1995, a 21% increase. The increase was due to increases in margin and other interest bearing assets. For 1996 margin interest increased to $28.3 million from $25.6 million in 1995, an 11% increase. Average margin balances outstanding increased $57 million, or 18%, for 1996 when compared to the same 1995 period. Offsetting these increases were decreases in the average broker call rate of 55 basis points for 1996 when compared to the 1995 period. Other interest income increased to $4.9 million in 1996 from $3.8 million in 1995, a 31% increase, due to an increase in securities borrowed and other interest bearing assets. A decrease in the average Federal Funds rate of approximately 50 basis points for 1996 when compared to the same periods last year, led to a decrease in the Companys rate for borrowing. The decline in rates was offset by the increased funding needed for the growth in interest bearing assets, resulting in a slight increase in interest expense. Commissions on retail sales from TradeStar increased to $9.2 million in 1996 from $6.6 million in 1995, an increase of 40%. This was the result of transaction volume which was up 37% in 1996 when compared to 1995. Customer accounts purchased in the third quarter of 1995 represented 70% of the increase and the remainder of the increase was due to growth in retail activity. In 1996, other income increased to $4.8 million from $2.9 million in 1995, a 64% increase. The increases were primarily due to increased quote service fees from netVest and Banquote and income from investments. Expenses, excluding interest, increased by 18% in 1996 compared to the same period in 1995. The increases were primarily related to increases in employees compensation and benefits, 18 communication costs, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Employees compensation and benefits increased to $23.4 million in 1996 from $20.4 million in 1995, a 15% increase. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the staff additions related to the acquisition by the Company of netVest and the acquisition by TradeStar of PNC Securities Corps Trade$aver, a discount broker service for correspondent banks and individuals in the third quarter of 1995, and normal and recurring salary adjustments. Average full time equivalents increased by 8% in 1996 when compared to 1995, and recurring salary adjustments increased an average of 4% from 1996 to 1995. The increase in floor brokerage and clearing expense of $337,000, or 6%, was a direct result of the increase in transactions processed. Floor brokerage and clearing represents 12% and 14%, respectively, of processing and support fees for 1996 and 1995, respectively. Occupancy and equipment costs increased to $6.8 million in 1996 from $6.0 million in 1995, a 14% increase. This was due in part to increased variable costs related to the increase in mutual fund processing and increased rent as a result of the business units acquired in the third quarter of 1995. Communications expenses increased to $3.8 million in 1996 from $2.8 million in 1995, a 33% increase. The increase was due in part to the costs associated with the PC and telephone inquiry, trading and quote services offered through netVest, which was acquired early in the third quarter of 1995, and increased costs associated with the Banquote product. Other operating expenses increased to $11.2 million in 1996 from $8.4 million in 1995, a 33% increase. The primary reason for the increases are related to systems development initiatives for order entry products that will continue to be funded through the first quarter of 1997, as well as to travel and promotion costs and amortization of goodwill on the 1995 acquisitions. The provision for income taxes increased to $11.9 million and the effective tax rate was 40% in 1996 compared to a 38% effective tax rate in 1995. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to a reduction in the percentage of income derived from state tax exempt income. On January 21, 1994, BHC received notice that a purported holder of a brokerage account with a BHC Client filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York which alleges that BHC received, in violation of New York statutory and common law, cash payments from market makers in certain securities (referred to as payment for order flow) in return for BHC executing customer orders with such market makers. In the complaint, the plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and damages, a return of cash payments for order flow, in addition to clearing and execution fees earned by BHC from January 1, 1990, certification of this matter as a class action, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees in an unspecified amount. Payment for order flow is common practice within the securities industry. BHC removed this matter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the federal court, on December 18, 1995, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The plaintiff appealed the dismissal, and on 19 January 17, 1997 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the final judgment of the Lower Court on jurisdictional grounds and remanded with instructions to remand the action to State Court. In the opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from this matter will have no material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. The materiality of this matter on the Companys future operating results depends on the level of future results of operations, as well as on the timing and amount of the ultimate outcome. 1995 Compared with 1994 In 1995, net revenues increased $10.3 million, or 19%, over 1994. The higher net revenues were the result of increases in processing and support service fees, commissions, net interest and other income. Processing and support service fees increased $5.3 million, or 14%, due to a 20% increase in transactions processed. In periods when transaction volumes increase, processing and support service revenue will increase, while processing and support service revenue per ticket will decline. This is due to BHCs volume discount program which rewards Clients for high transaction volumes by reducing the charge per transaction when certain volume levels are achieved. As a result of an increase in transactions processed in 1995, average processing and support service revenues per ticket decreased $1.35, or 5%. Net interest income of $13.8 million in 1995 increased $2.5 million, or 22%, from the 1994 level of $11.3 million. The growth was principally attributable to an increase in margin interest income of $5.3 million, or 27%, which was a result of a $6 million, or 2%, growth in average margin debit balances. This increase was despite the loss of a single margin account of $30 million in the second quarter of 1995 as a result of managements determination that the account was unduly concentrated. The positive effect of the increased average margin balances was further enhanced by the higher interest rate environment experienced in 1995. The year to year increase in the average broker call rate was 164 basis points. Interest expense in 1995 increased $3.7 million, or 31%. Increased funding needed for the growth in average margin debit balances and an increase in the federal funds rate of approximately 170 basis points resulted in the increase in interest expense. Commissions on retail trades from customers of TradeStar increased $2.0 million, or 43%, in 1995. This was a result of a 57% increase in transactions processed. Customer accounts purchased late in the third quarter of 1995 represented 8% of the increase. In 1995, other income increased $519,000, or 21%. PC and telephone inquiry, trading, and quote services from netVest and other fees ancillary to the processing of securities transactions accounted for the increase. Expenses, excluding interest, increased by 12% in 1995 primarily related to increases in employees compensation and benefits, floor brokerage and clearing and communications costs. 20 Employees compensation and benefits increased $3 million, or 17%, in 1995. Compensation expenses in 1995 include the impact of approximately $450,000, or 3%, related to business units acquired in the third quarter of 1995. An increase of $550,000, or 3%, in officers incentive bonuses, which are tied to the companys earnings, was also included in 1995. After adjusting for the number of employees related to business units acquired, average full time employees increased 7% while normal and recurring salary adjustments increased an average of 6%. The increase in floor brokerage and clearing of $1 million, or 22%, was a direct result of the 20% increase in transactions processed. Floor brokerage and clearing represents 14% and 13%, respectively, of processing and support service fees for 1995 and 1994, respectively. Communications, occupancy and equipment costs increased $783,000, or 10%, in 1995. The increase in cost was due to the addition of redundant data and voice communication lines, increased quote costs related to the Banquote product and costs associated with the PC and telephone inquiry, trading and quote services offered through netVest. Other operating expenses decreased by $192,000, or 2%, in 1995. The primary reason for the decrease was lower local taxes and product maintenance costs, offset by higher state franchise taxes, promotional expenses and consulting programming fees in connection with enhancements to the brokerage processing system. The provision for income taxes increased $2.3 million in 1995 due primarily to higher pre tax income as compared to 1994. The effective tax rate was 37.7% in 1995 and 36.6% in 1994. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to a smaller portion of income derived from state tax exempt income in 1995. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 1996, 96% of assets consisted of cash, assets readily convertible into cash or assets collateralized by marketable securities. Stockholders equity was $93.5 million at December 31, 1996, up $8.2 million, or 10%, from December 31, 1995, which was due to earnings offset by dividends and the repurchase of $9.0 million of the Companys Common Stock. The Company has uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $215 million with several banks. At December 31, 1996, the Company had outstanding borrowings under these arrangements of $33.2 million. These demand loans, which are used to finance receivables in customers margin accounts, bear interest at the respective banks overnight borrowing rate and are collateralized by securities held in customers margin accounts and cash equivalents. In the opinion of management, the Companys existing credit arrangements are adequate to meet the Companys short term operating capital needs. On January 15, 1997, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $.03 per share dividend payable February 14, 1997 to stockholders of record on February 1, 1997, resulting in a payment of approximately $190,000. 21 BHC, TradeStar and BHCM are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Commission. BHC is subject to the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., and TradeStar and BHCM are subject to the requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., relating to liquidity, minimum net capital levels and the use of customer funds and securities. BHC, BHCM and, since the Company acquired it, TradeStar have always operated in excess of the applicable minimum net capital requirements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, the Companys existing capital and lines of credit are sufficient to meet the operating capital needs for the foreseeable future in light of known and reasonably estimated trends. Other The Company licenses its software under a long term licensing agreement. The software provider is responsible for maintenance of the system including modifications to enable uninterrupted usage after the year 2000. The software provider has issued a formal plan for compliance with year 2000 system enhancements and it is not anticipated that this will result in a material financial undertaking by the Company to complete. Effects of Inflation Because the Companys assets are, to a large extent, liquid in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, such as employees compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs and communications expense, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates, this may adversely affect transaction volume, which, in turn, may adversely affect the Companys results of operations. 22

Because of the recent purchases by the Company of its Common Stock, the Company may be required, among other things, to sell approximately 200,000 shares of its Common Stock (either through the exercise of stock options or by a stock offering to unrelated parties) prior to the Effective Time in order for the Merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. As part of the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue and sell such shares after the date of the special meeting of the stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement, and prior to the consummation of the Merger, to the extent necessary to satisfy such condition. Important Factors Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements regarding the Companys expectations as to its future operations and financial condition and certain other information presented in this Annual Report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations. Factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include a general downturn in the economy or the stock markets and the related transaction activity, substantial changes in interest rates, the gain or loss of significant customers, unforeseen new competition, changes in government policy or regulation and unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings. Results of Operations The Companys revenues are directly affected by the income derived from its processing and support services. Such revenues are affected by both the transaction volume of accounts and the level of, and interest rate charged on, customer margin debit balances. The information in the table below should be considered when reading the discussion and analysis of operating results that follow the table. Percentage Change For the Year Ended December 31, 1996 1995 Year Ended December 31, Compared Compared 1996 1995 1994 to 1995 to 1994 Total transactions (in thousands) 2,239 1,665 1,383 34% 20% Daily average transactions processed 8,813 6,606 5,487 33% 20% Number of active accounts at end of period (in thousands)(1) 1,125 1,075 916 5% 17% Average margin debit balances (in millions) $ 379 $ 322 $ 316 18% 2% Average broker call rate 7.03% 7.58% 5.94% (1) Active accounts are generally those that have positions or have had brokerage processing activity during the previous 18 months. 17 1996 Compared with 1995 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996 reached $81.2 million which was $15.5 million, or 24%, greater than the $65.7 million generated for the year ended December 31, 1995. The increases were the result of increases in processing and support service fees, net interest income, commissions and other income. Processing and support service fees increased to $50.6 million for 1996 from $42.5 million in 1995, a 19% increase. The increase was due to increased transaction volume of 34% for the period. The financial results of 1996 reflect the loss of three Clients during the year which was offset by transactions from new clients signed late in 1995 and throughout 1996. The average revenue per ticket declined by $2.94, or 12%, in 1996 when compared to 1995. Generally in periods where daily transaction volumes are increasing, revenue will increase, while processing and support service revenue per ticket will decline. This is due to BHCs volume discount program which rewards Clients for high transaction volumes by reducing the charge per transaction when various volume levels are achieved. In addition, the Company faces pressure on profit margins as Clients become larger due to the threat of Clients internalizing their brokerage processing and support functions and due to general pricing pressure from increased market competition. Net interest income (margin interest income and other interest income less interest expense) increased to $16.6 million in 1996 from $13.7 million in 1995, a 21% increase. The increase was due to increases in margin and other interest bearing assets. For 1996 margin interest increased to $28.3 million from $25.6 million in 1995, an 11% increase. Average margin balances outstanding increased $57 million, or 18%, for 1996 when compared to the same 1995 period. Offsetting these increases were decreases in the average broker call rate of 55 basis points for 1996 when compared to the 1995 period. Other interest income increased to $4.9 million in 1996 from $3.8 million in 1995, a 31% increase, due to an increase in securities borrowed and other interest bearing assets. A decrease in the average Federal Funds rate of approximately 50 basis points for 1996 when compared to the same periods last year, led to a decrease in the Companys rate for borrowing. The decline in rates was offset by the increased funding needed for the growth in interest bearing assets, resulting in a slight increase in interest expense. Commissions on retail sales from TradeStar increased to $9.2 million in 1996 from $6.6 million in 1995, an increase of 40%. This was the result of transaction volume which was up 37% in 1996 when compared to 1995. Customer accounts purchased in the third quarter of 1995 represented 70% of the increase and the remainder of the increase was due to growth in retail activity. In 1996, other income increased to $4.8 million from $2.9 million in 1995, a 64% increase. The increases were primarily due to increased quote service fees from netVest and Banquote and income from investments. Expenses, excluding interest, increased by 18% in 1996 compared to the same period in 1995. The increases were primarily related to increases in employees compensation and benefits, 18 communication costs, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Employees compensation and benefits increased to $23.4 million in 1996 from $20.4 million in 1995, a 15% increase. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the staff additions related to the acquisition by the Company of netVest and the acquisition by TradeStar of PNC Securities Corps Trade$aver, a discount broker service for correspondent banks and individuals in the third quarter of 1995, and normal and recurring salary adjustments. Average full time equivalents increased by 8% in 1996 when compared to 1995, and recurring salary adjustments increased an average of 4% from 1996 to 1995. The increase in floor brokerage and clearing expense of $337,000, or 6%, was a direct result of the increase in transactions processed. Floor brokerage and clearing represents 12% and 14%, respectively, of processing and support fees for 1996 and 1995, respectively. Occupancy and equipment costs increased to $6.8 million in 1996 from $6.0 million in 1995, a 14% increase. This was due in part to increased variable costs related to the increase in mutual fund processing and increased rent as a result of the business units acquired in the third quarter of 1995. Communications expenses increased to $3.8 million in 1996 from $2.8 million in 1995, a 33% increase. The increase was due in part to the costs associated with the PC and telephone inquiry, trading and quote services offered through netVest, which was acquired early in the third quarter of 1995, and increased costs associated with the Banquote product. Other operating expenses increased to $11.2 million in 1996 from $8.4 million in 1995, a 33% increase. The primary reason for the increases are related to systems development initiatives for order entry products that will continue to be funded through the first quarter of 1997, as well as to travel and promotion costs and amortization of goodwill on the 1995 acquisitions. The provision for income taxes increased to $11.9 million and the effective tax rate was 40% in 1996 compared to a 38% effective tax rate in 1995. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to a reduction in the percentage of income derived from state tax exempt income. On January 21, 1994, BHC received notice that a purported holder of a brokerage account with a BHC Client filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York which alleges that BHC received, in violation of New York statutory and common law, cash payments from market makers in certain securities (referred to as payment for order flow) in return for BHC executing customer orders with such market makers. In the complaint, the plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and damages, a return of cash payments for order flow, in addition to clearing and execution fees earned by BHC from January 1, 1990, certification of this matter as a class action, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees in an unspecified amount. Payment for order flow is common practice within the securities industry. BHC removed this matter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the federal court, on December 18, 1995, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The plaintiff appealed the dismissal, and on 19 January 17, 1997 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the final judgment of the Lower Court on jurisdictional grounds and remanded with instructions to remand the action to State Court. In the opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from this matter will have no material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. The materiality of this matter on the Companys future operating results depends on the level of future results of operations, as well as on the timing and amount of the ultimate outcome. 1995 Compared with 1994 In 1995, net revenues increased $10.3 million, or 19%, over 1994. The higher net revenues were the result of increases in processing and support service fees, commissions, net interest and other income. Processing and support service fees increased $5.3 million, or 14%, due to a 20% increase in transactions processed. In periods when transaction volumes increase, processing and support service revenue will increase, while processing and support service revenue per ticket will decline. This is due to BHCs volume discount program which rewards Clients for high transaction volumes by reducing the charge per transaction when certain volume levels are achieved. As a result of an increase in transactions processed in 1995, average processing and support service revenues per ticket decreased $1.35, or 5%. Net interest income of $13.8 million in 1995 increased $2.5 million, or 22%, from the 1994 level of $11.3 million. The growth was principally attributable to an increase in margin interest income of $5.3 million, or 27%, which was a result of a $6 million, or 2%, growth in average margin debit balances. This increase was despite the loss of a single margin account of $30 million in the second quarter of 1995 as a result of managements determination that the account was unduly concentrated. The positive effect of the increased average margin balances was further enhanced by the higher interest rate environment experienced in 1995. The year to year increase in the average broker call rate was 164 basis points. Interest expense in 1995 increased $3.7 million, or 31%. Increased funding needed for the growth in average margin debit balances and an increase in the federal funds rate of approximately 170 basis points resulted in the increase in interest expense. Commissions on retail trades from customers of TradeStar increased $2.0 million, or 43%, in 1995. This was a result of a 57% increase in transactions processed. Customer accounts purchased late in the third quarter of 1995 represented 8% of the increase. In 1995, other income increased $519,000, or 21%. PC and telephone inquiry, trading, and quote services from netVest and other fees ancillary to the processing of securities transactions accounted for the increase. Expenses, excluding interest, increased by 12% in 1995 primarily related to increases in employees compensation and benefits, floor brokerage and clearing and communications costs. 20 Employees compensation and benefits increased $3 million, or 17%, in 1995. Compensation expenses in 1995 include the impact of approximately $450,000, or 3%, related to business units acquired in the third quarter of 1995. An increase of $550,000, or 3%, in officers incentive bonuses, which are tied to the companys earnings, was also included in 1995. After adjusting for the number of employees related to business units acquired, average full time employees increased 7% while normal and recurring salary adjustments increased an average of 6%. The increase in floor brokerage and clearing of $1 million, or 22%, was a direct result of the 20% increase in transactions processed. Floor brokerage and clearing represents 14% and 13%, respectively, of processing and support service fees for 1995 and 1994, respectively. Communications, occupancy and equipment costs increased $783,000, or 10%, in 1995. The increase in cost was due to the addition of redundant data and voice communication lines, increased quote costs related to the Banquote product and costs associated with the PC and telephone inquiry, trading and quote services offered through netVest. Other operating expenses decreased by $192,000, or 2%, in 1995. The primary reason for the decrease was lower local taxes and product maintenance costs, offset by higher state franchise taxes, promotional expenses and consulting programming fees in connection with enhancements to the brokerage processing system. The provision for income taxes increased $2.3 million in 1995 due primarily to higher pre tax income as compared to 1994. The effective tax rate was 37.7% in 1995 and 36.6% in 1994. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to a smaller portion of income derived from state tax exempt income in 1995. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 1996, 96% of assets consisted of cash, assets readily convertible into cash or assets collateralized by marketable securities. Stockholders equity was $93.5 million at December 31, 1996, up $8.2 million, or 10%, from December 31, 1995, which was due to earnings offset by dividends and the repurchase of $9.0 million of the Companys Common Stock. The Company has uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $215 million with several banks. At December 31, 1996, the Company had outstanding borrowings under these arrangements of $33.2 million. These demand loans, which are used to finance receivables in customers margin accounts, bear interest at the respective banks overnight borrowing rate and are collateralized by securities held in customers margin accounts and cash equivalents. In the opinion of management, the Companys existing credit arrangements are adequate to meet the Companys short term operating capital needs. On January 15, 1997, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $.03 per share dividend payable February 14, 1997 to stockholders of record on February 1, 1997, resulting in a payment of approximately $190,000. 21 BHC, TradeStar and BHCM are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Commission. BHC is subject to the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., and TradeStar and BHCM are subject to the requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., relating to liquidity, minimum net capital levels and the use of customer funds and securities. BHC, BHCM and, since the Company acquired it, TradeStar have always operated in excess of the applicable minimum net capital requirements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, the Companys existing capital and lines of credit are sufficient to meet the operating capital needs for the foreseeable future in light of known and reasonably estimated trends. Other The Company licenses its software under a long term licensing agreement. The software provider is responsible for maintenance of the system including modifications to enable uninterrupted usage after the year 2000. The software provider has issued a formal plan for compliance with year 2000 system enhancements and it is not anticipated that this will result in a material financial undertaking by the Company to complete. Effects of Inflation Because the Companys assets are, to a large extent, liquid in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, such as employees compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs and communications expense, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates, this may adversely affect transaction volume, which, in turn, may adversely affect the Companys results of operations. 22
