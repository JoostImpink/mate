ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements. The following discussion of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and Spartechs consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company has based its forward looking statements about its markets and demand for its products and future results on assumptions that the Company considers reasonable. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by such forward looking statements for various reasons, including those discussed in Cautionary Statements Concerning Forward Looking Statements and Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts and analyses are based on continuing operations. Non GAAP Financial Measures Item 7 contains financial information prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and operating earnings excluding special items, net earnings from continuing operations excluding special items and net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding special items that are considered non GAAP financial measures. Special items include merger and transaction costs, foreign exchange gains/losses, restructuring and exit costs, goodwill impairment, other intangibles and fixed asset impairments, CEO separation costs, debt extinguishment costs and tax benefits from restructuring of foreign operations. Generally, a non GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys financial performance, financial position or cash flow that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of these measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of the Companys operating performance. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures at other companies. The Company believes that these measurements are useful to investors because it helps them compare the Companys results to previous periods and provides an indication of underlying trends in the business. Non GAAP measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. See the Non GAAP Reconciliations section at the end of Item 7 for a reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP measures.Business OverviewSpartech is an intermediary producer of plastic products, including polymeric compounds, concentrates, custom extruded sheet and rollstock products and packaging technologies. The Company converts base polymers or resins purchased from commodity suppliers into extruded plastic sheet and rollstock, thermoformed packaging, specialty film laminates, acrylic products, specialty plastic alloys, color concentrates and blended resin compounds for customers in a wide range of markets. The Company has facilities located throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and France that are organized into three segments as follows: Percentage of Net Sales 2012 2011Custom Sheet and Rollstock53% 53%Packaging Technologies21% 22%Color and Specialty Compounds26% 25% 100% 100%On October 23, 2012, PolyOne Merger Sub, Merger LLC, and Spartech entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant to which Spartech will be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Spartech to be the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of PolyOne. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Spartech common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive consideration equal to $2.67 in cash and 0.3167 PolyOne common shares. In the aggregate, PolyOne will issue approximately 9.9 million of its common shares and pay approximately $84,000,000 in cash to Spartech shareholders. The closing of the Merger is expected to occur during the first calendar quarter of 2013, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including, among other things: (1) the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by Spartechs stockholders; (2) receipt of required regulatory approvals; (3) the absence of certain legal impediments preventing 18Table of Contentsthe consummation of the Merger; (4) the effectiveness of the registration on Form S 4 to be filed by PolyOne relating to the PolyOne common shares to be issued in the Merger; (5) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (6) the approval by the New York Stock Exchange of the listing of PolyOne common shares issuable to Spartech stockholders under the Merger Agreement; and (7) the delivery of opinions from counsel to PolyOne and counsel to Spartech to the effect that the Merger will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Early termination of the required waiting period under Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act was granted on November 21, 2012.In 2009, the Company sold its wheels and profiles businesses and closed and liquidated three businesses, including a manufacturer of boat components sold to the marine market and one compounding and one sheet business that previously serviced single customers. These businesses are classified as discontinued operations and all amounts presented within this Item 7 are presented on a continuing basis, unless otherwise noted. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of these divestitures and closures. The wheels, profiles and marine businesses were previously reported in the Engineered Products group and due to these dispositions, the Company no longer has this reporting group. The Company assesses net sales changes using three major drivers: underlying volume, price changes, and mix of product sold. Underlying volume is calculated as the change in pounds sold for a comparable number of days in the reporting period. The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to October 31st and fiscal years generally contain 52 weeks. However, because of this accounting convention, every fifth or sixth fiscal year has an additional week, and 2012 is reported as a 53 week fiscal year. The Companys first quarter ended February 4, 2012 and year ended November 3, 2012 included 14 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively, compared to 13 weeks and 52 weeks in the prior year periods. Please see the reconciliation tables and narrative below for adjustments to GAAP and discussion of special items affecting results. Special items include restructuring and exit costs. Years presented are fiscal unless noted otherwise.Executive SummaryNet sales of $1.1 billion in 2012 increased 4% from 2011 representing a 1% increase from price/mix, a 2% increase from the impact of an extra week, and a 1% increase in volume. The increase in volume was due to an increase in sales of sheet for material handling applications along with increased sales volume of compounds and sheet to the automotive and commercial construction end markets. The price/mix changes related to a product mix that included a greater percentage of higher priced products and the impact of changing raw material prices passed through as changes in selling price. Operating earnings excluding special items increased by $3.3 million to $24.4 million in 2012. The $3.3 million increase in earnings was primarily caused by improvements in our operations from our turnaround efforts. This increase overcame a $3.3 million change in bad debt expense from reversals in the prior year. The increase for the year also reflects the impact of an additional week, which accounts for approximately $1.6 million of the total change in 2012 vs. 2011. The higher gross margin was caused by increases in sales volume, production efficiencies and better product mix.During 2012, we showed continued improvements from our turnaround efforts in our Color and Specialty Compounds segment, which we began in the first quarter of 2011. We also realized continued momentum in our turnaround efforts in the Custom Sheet and Rollstock segment which we began in the third quarter of 2011.OutlookThe Company gained momentum on its key priorities and turnaround efforts in 2012 which provided for the improved results and established a stronger foundation for future earnings growth. We expect to continue to build on this foundation and execute on our growth strategy which focuses on shifting our product mix towards more specialized and higher margin products. We expect continued improvements from our turnaround efforts in our Color and Specialty Compounds and Custom Sheet and Rollstock segments. The Packaging Technologies segment is positioned to capitalize on its expanded customer base in 2013. While recent customer order patterns have remained stable and resin costs have experienced downward pressure, slow and uncertain demand in the markets we serve and dynamic raw material costs may impact our financial results in future periods. We expect low to moderate sales volume growth in 2013 as well as higher selling prices and a continued shift in mix to higher margin business which should result in solid improvement in our results for the full year 2013 compared to 2012. We remain committed to providing value to our stockholders through the completion of our turnaround strategy, the shift of mix to more specialty products, and focus on sustainable growth.19Table of ContentsResults of OperationsComparison of 2012 and 2011:Consolidated SummaryNet sales were $1,149.4 million and $1,102.3 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing an 4% increase. The increase was caused by: 2012 vs. 2011Underlying volume1%Volume from additional week2%Price/Mix1%Total4%The increase in volume was due to an increase in sales of sheet for material handling applications along with increased sales volume of compounds and sheet to the automotive and commercial construction end markets. The price/mix changes related to a product mix that included a greater percentage of higher priced products and the impact of changing raw material prices passed through as changes in selling price. The following table presents net sales, cost of sales and the resulting gross margin in dollars and on a per pound sold basis for 2012 and 2011. Cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of operations includes material and conversion costs but excludes amortization of intangible assets. We have not presented cost of sales and gross margin as a percentage of net sales because a comparison of this measure is distorted by changes in resin costs that are typically passed through to customers as changes to selling prices. These changes can materially affect the percentages but do not present complete performance measures of the business. 2012 2011Dollars and Pounds (in millions) Net sales$1,149.4 $1,102.3Cost of sales1,038.0 1,004.9Gross margin$111.4 $97.4 Pounds sold922 898Dollars per Pound Sold Net sales$1.247 $1.227Cost of sales1.126 1.119Gross margin$0.121 $0.108Gross margin per pound sold increased from 10.8 cents in 2011 to 12.1 cents in 2012. This increase primarily reflects the impact of the Companys turnaround efforts, shift to higher margin business and production efficiencies which was somewhat offset by increased costs due to higher labor associated with certain operating improvements. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $85.2 million in 2012 compared to $74.5 million in 2011. The increase reflects higher labor and variable pay expenses along with the impact of $2.0 million in net bad debt income in 2011 compared to $1.3 million of bad debt expense in 2012. We established reserves for two large customers in 2010 and we recorded $3.1 million of income in 2011 because of favorable developments of contingencies on two customer receivable balances. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing and concluded that the carrying value of its Packaging Technologies reporting unit is not impaired. Packaging Technologies has a goodwill balance of $47.5 million and is the only reporting unit with a goodwill balance as of fiscal year end 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and recorded $40.5 million of non cash goodwill impairments. We concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to differences between the Companys fair value and book value of our Custom Sheet and Rollstock segment. During 2011, we recorded $13.7 million of non cash other intangible and fixed asset impairments that were caused by under performance of historical acquisitions and decisions to dispose of certain fixed assets. 20Table of ContentsRestructuring and exit costs were $2.5 million in 2012 compared to $2.2 million in 2011. For both periods, restructuring and exit costs were comprised of employee severance, facility consolidation and shutdown costs and fixed asset valuation adjustments including accelerated depreciation from shortening useful lives. These costs resulted from the Companys improvement initiatives, which include an objective of reducing the Companys fixed portion of its cost structure. Refer to Note 6, Restructuring for further information regarding restructuring plans.In conjunction with the definitive merger agreement under which PolyOne Corporation will acquire all the outstanding shares of Spartech, the Company has incurred various costs triggered by and directly related to the merger transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Spartech recognized $6.9 million of merger and transaction costs, including stock compensation expense from the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding equity awards, legal and financial advisor fees, and other costs directly related to the proposed merger transaction.Interest expense, net of interest income, was $11.9 million in 2012 compared to $10.9 million in 2011. The increase was primarily driven by higher interest rates, the additional fee to Senior Note holders, which was capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining life of the Notes as an adjustment to interest expense, and the impact of the extra week.Income tax expense was $1.1 million in 2012 compared to a benefit of $8.9 million in 2011 representing an effective tax rate of 28% and 27%, respectively. The Companys 2012 tax rate was impacted by several discrete tax adjustments. The majority of these items related to income tax return to provision adjustments. The Companys 2011 tax rate was impacted by the portion of goodwill impairment which was not deductible in the amount of $8.3 million. We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $2.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share in 2012, which compared to a loss of $23.4 million or $0.76 per diluted share in 2011. Excluding special items, we reported net earnings from continuing operations of $8.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share in 2012, compared to $6.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share in 2011. The increase was due to impact of the Companys turnaround efforts, shift to higher margin business, production efficiencies and an additional week in 2012. Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.1 million in 2012 compared to earnings of $2.3 million in 2011. The earnings in 2011 mainly resulted from the settlement agreement for breach of contract by Chemtura that led to $3.0 million in cash proceeds after tax. Segment ResultsThe Company reorganized its internal reporting structure and management responsibilities for the Passaic matter and the associated closed facility during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of developments with the environmental matters, as described in Item 3. These costs were previously reported under the Color & Specialty Compounds segment, but are now reported in Corporate. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company reorganized its internal reporting and management responsibilities of a product line from its Color and Specialty Compounds segment to its Custom Sheet and Rollstock segment to better align the management of this product line with end markets. During the second quarter of 2010, we moved our organizational reporting and management responsibilities of two businesses previously included in our Color and Specialty Compounds segment to our Custom Sheet and Rollstock segment. Also in this second quarter, we reorganized our internal reporting and management responsibilities of certain product lines between our Custom Sheet and Rollstock and Packaging Technologies segments to better align management of these product lines with end markets. These management and reporting changes resulted in a reorganization of the Companys three reportable segments. Historical segment results have been reclassified to conform to these changes.Custom Sheet and Rollstock SegmentNet sales were $604.3 million and $577.4 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The change was caused by: 2012 vs. 2011Underlying volume 1%Volume from additional week2%Price/Mix4%Total5%The decrease in underlying volume reflects lower sales to the appliance and electronics end market which was mostly offset by the increase in sales of sheet for material handling applications along with increases in automotive and commercial construction 21Table of Contentsend markets. The price/mix increase was mostly caused by increases in selling prices and greater mix of higher priced products. Operating earnings excluding special items were $30.4 million in 2012 compared to $24.9 million in 2011. The increase in operating earnings was attributable to an increased mix of higher margin products and operating improvements such as increased production yield and regrind material usage, which were slightly offset by increased costs related to labor and variable pay. This increase overcame a $3.2 million change in bad debt expense from reversals in the prior year.Packaging Technologies Net sales were $243.1 million and $244.0 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The net sales changes were: 2012 vs. 2011Underlying volume 4%Volume from additional week2%Price/Mix2%Total%The decrease in underlying volume can be mainly attributed to a decrease in graphic arts sales related to certain programs not continuing in 2012. The price/mix increase was primarily related to a product mix that included a greater percentage of higher priced products.Operating earnings excluding special items were $18.0 million in 2012, compared to $23.8 million in 2011. The decrease in operating earnings was due to lower volume, start up costs associated with accelerating production on our first Packaging Technologies line in Mexico, and additional development costs with various new customer programs in 2012.Color and Specialty Compounds Segment Net sales were $302.0 million and $280.9 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing an 8% increase. The increase was caused by: 2012 vs. 2011Underlying volume5%Volume from additional week2%Price/Mix1%Total8%The increase in underlying volume was due to a significant increase in sales to the commercial construction market, automotive sector of the transportation market and agricultural market. The price/mix increase was mostly caused by increases in selling prices to pass through increases in raw material costs and a greater percentage of higher priced products. Operating earnings excluding special items were $9.0 million in 2012 compared to $3.3 million in 2011. The significant increase in operating earnings reflects the increase in sales volume, benefits from improvements on our key priorities and a greater mix of higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of costs increases related to repairs and maintenance and labor costs.CorporateCorporate expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, corporate office expenses, shared services costs, information technology costs, professional fees, the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, and Passaic environmental costs. Corporate operating expenses were $39.3 million in 2012 compared to $30.7 million in 2011. The increased expenses in 2012 were mainly due to costs related to merger related expenses of $6.9 million, Passaic environmental costs and increased legal fees.22Table of ContentsComparison of 2011 and 2010:Consolidated SummaryNet sales were $1,102.3 million and $1,022.9 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing an 8% increase. The increase was caused by: 2011 vs. 2010Underlying volume 2%Price/Mix10%Total8%The decrease in volume was due to a decline in sales of sheet for material handling applications caused by a considerable slowdown in orders from one customer. Mitigating this decrease was increased sales volume of compounds and sheet to the automotive and agricultural sectors of our end markets, and compounds to the commercial construction end market from gradual demand recovery. The price/mix increases were related to increases in selling prices to pass through increases in raw material costs and a product mix that included a greater percentage of higher priced products. The following table presents net sales, cost of sales and the resulting gross margin in dollars and on a per pound sold basis for 2011 and 2010. Cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of operations includes material and conversion costs but excludes amortization of intangible assets. We have not presented cost of sales and gross margin as a percentage of net sales because a comparison of this measure is distorted by changes in resin costs that are typically passed through to customers as changes to selling prices. These changes can materially affect the percentages but do not present complete performance measures of the business. 2011 2010Dollars and Pounds (in millions) Net sales$1,102.3 $1,022.9Cost of sales1,004.9 914.3Gross margin$97.4 $108.6 Pounds sold898 915Dollars per Pound Sold Net sales$1.227 $1.118Cost of sales1.119 0.999Gross margin$0.108 $0.119Gross margin per pound sold declined from 11.9 cents in 2010 to 10.8 cents in 2011. This decrease primarily reflects the impact of production inefficiencies that began in the second half of 2010 and higher costs. The inefficiencies and higher costs were partially offset by reduced depreciation expense due to the Companys plant consolidation efforts and a decrease in workers compensation expense due to lower claims. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $74.5 million in 2011 compared to $86.7 million in 2010. The decrease reflects the impact of $2.0 million in net bad debt income in 2011 compared to $8.1 million of bad debt expense in 2010. We established reserves for two large customers in 2010 and we recorded $3.1 million of income in 2011 because of favorable developments of contingencies on two customer receivable balances. Amortization of intangibles was $1.7 million in 2011 compared to $3.8 million in 2010. The decrease is due to intangibles that became fully amortized coupled with the impact of intangible asset impairments recorded by the Company in 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and recorded $40.5 million of non cash goodwill impairments. We concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to differences between the Companys fair value and book value of our Custom Sheet and Rollstock segment. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded $56.1 million of non cash goodwill impairments because we concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill was impaired due to differences between the Companys fair value and book value of our Packaging Technologies and Color & Specialty Compounds segments. 23Table of ContentsDuring 2010, we recorded $13.7 million of non cash other intangible and fixed asset impairments that were caused by under performance of historical acquisitions and decisions to dispose of certain fixed assets. Restructuring and exit costs were $2.2 million in 2011 compared to $7.3 million in 2010. For both periods, restructuring and exit costs were comprised of employee severance, facility consolidation and shutdown costs and fixed asset valuation adjustments. These costs resulted from the Companys improvement initiatives, which include an objective of reducing the Companys fixed portion of its cost structure. Refer to Note 6, Restructuring for further information regarding restructuring plans.Interest expense, net of interest income, was $10.9 million in 2011 compared to $12.0 million in 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by lower debt levels and reduction in higher interest rate debt.In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded $0.7 million of non cash debt extinguishment costs related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the extinguishment of the Companys previous credit facility and 2006 Senior Notes. The Companys effective tax rate in 2011 and 2010 was impacted by the portion of goodwill impairments that was not deductible of $8.3 million and $27.7 million, respectively. Excluding the goodwill impairments in 2011, our effective tax rate would have been 38.6%. We reported a net loss from continuing operations of $23.4 million or $0.76 per diluted share in 2011, which compared to a loss of $49.6 million or $1.63 per diluted share in 2010. Excluding special items, we reported net earnings from continuing operations of $6.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $6.6 million or $0.21 per diluted share in 2010. The increase was mainly due to the lower selling, general and administrative expenses as previously discussed. Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax were $2.3 million in 2011 compared to a loss of $0.7 million in 2010. The earnings in 2011 mainly resulted from the settlement agreement for breach of contract by Chemtura that led to $3.0 million in cash proceeds after tax. The loss in 2010 mostly resulted from the final settlement of a purchase price adjustment related to the prior year sale of the profiles business. Segment ResultsThe Company reorganized its internal reporting structure and management responsibilities for the Passaic matter and the associated closed facility during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of developments with the environmental matters, as described in Item 3. These costs were previously reported under the Color & Specialty Compounds segment, but are now reported in Corporate. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company reorganized its internal reporting and management responsibilities of a product line from its Color and Specialty Compounds segment to its Custom Sheet and Rollstock segment to better align the management of this product line with end markets. During the second quarter of 2010, we moved our organizational reporting and management responsibilities of two businesses previously included in our Color and Specialty Compounds segment to our Custom Sheet and Rollstock segment. Also in this second quarter, we reorganized our internal reporting and management responsibilities of certain product lines between our Custom Sheet and Rollstock and Packaging Technologies segments to better align management of these product lines with end markets. These management and reporting changes resulted in a reorganization of the Companys three reportable segments. Historical segment results have been reclassified to conform to these changes. Custom Sheet and Rollstock SegmentNet sales were $577.4 million and $579.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change was caused by: 2011 vs. 2010Underlying volume 11%Price/Mix11%Total0%The decrease in volume was caused by the impact of a significant reduction in one customers business activity for a material handling application. Absent this customers decline, we saw a slight increase in volume reflecting additional sales volume sold to the automotive and recreation and leisure sectors, which was offset by a decrease in volume sold of construction and building product and refrigeration sheet. The price/mix increase was mostly caused by increases in selling prices and greater mix of higher priced products. 24Table of ContentsOperating earnings excluding special items were $24.9 million in 2011 compared to $28.4 million in 2010. The decrease in operating earnings reflected lower sales volume, production inefficiencies and higher costs which more than offset $9.2 million of lower bad debts expense. We reported $7.6 million of bad debt expense to establish reserves for two large customers in 2010 and recorded $2.5 million of income because of favorable developments on one of the large customers in 2011. Packaging Technologies Net sales were $244.0 million and $221.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing a 10% increase. The increase was caused by: 2011 vs. 2010Underlying volume 2%Price/Mix12%Total10%The decrease in underlying volume reflects the impact of a loss of share at a food packaging customer. Price/mix primarily includes increases in selling prices from the pass through of increases in raw materials costs. Operating earnings excluding special items were $23.8 million in 2011, compared to $22.6 million in 2010. The increase in operating earnings was due to improved mix, lower depreciation and amortization expense from our prior year impairments and income resulting from the favorable developments on contingencies with two customers, which more than offset the impact of lower sales volume and cost increases.Color and Specialty Compounds Segment Net sales were $280.9 million and $222.4 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing a 26% increase. The increase was caused by: 2011 vs. 2010Underlying volume13%Price/Mix13%Total26%The increase in underlying volume was due to a significant increase in sales to the commercial construction market, automotive sector of the transportation market and agricultural market. The price/mix increase was mostly caused by increases in selling prices to pass through increases in raw material costs and a greater percentage of higher priced products. Operating earnings excluding special items were $3.3 million in 2011 compared to $2.3 million in 2010. The increase in operating earnings reflects the increase in sales volume, benefits from improvements on our key priorities and $0.6 million of lower bad debt expense from favorable developments on a contingency, which more than offset the impact of production inefficiencies caused by plant consolidation efforts that continued during the first half of 2011 and cost increases.CorporateCorporate expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, corporate office expenses, shared services costs, information technology costs, professional fees, the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, and Passaic environmental costs. Corporate operating expenses were $30.7 million in 2011 compared to $37.4 million in 2010. The lower expenses in 2011 were mainly due to costs related to the separation agreement with the Companys former President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 2010, foreign currency exchange losses in 2010 and lower professional fees in 2011.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowThe Companys primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities and borrowings from third parties. Historically, the Companys principal uses of cash have been to support operating activities, invest in capital improvements, reduce outstanding indebtedness, finance strategic business acquisitions, acquire treasury shares and pay dividends on its common stock. The following summarizes the major categories of changes in cash and cash equivalents in 2012, 2011 and 2010:25Table of Contents 2012 2011 2010Cash Flows (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities$44,273 $42,298 $39,330Net cash used by investing activities(19,813) (28,619) (17,872)Net cash used by financing activities(24,235) (17,153) (43,565)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(10) (549) 82Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$215 $(4,023) $(22,025)Net cash provided by operating activities was $44.3 million in 2012 compared to $42.3 million in 2011. The increase reflects higher earnings in 2012. Inventories increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to increased sales which were offset by higher payables and accrued liabilities.Net cash used for investing activities of $19.8 million in 2012 consisted of $20.0 million of capital expenditures less $0.2 million of proceeds from the disposition of assets. Net cash used for investing activities of $28.6 million in 2011 consisted of $29.1 million of capital expenditures less $0.5 million of proceeds from the disposition of assets associated with previously shut down operations. We expect our capital expenditures to range from $20 million to $25 million in 2013. Capital expenditures are expected to be funded mainly from operating cash flows.Net cash used for financing activities was $24.2 million in 2012 compared to $17.2 million in 2011. Net cash used for financing in 2012 consisted of payments on the Senior Notes and debt financing costs associated with the Companys Amendments. The net cash used for financing activities in 2011 consisted of credit facility payments and debt financing costs associated with Companys amendments.Financing ArrangementsOn September 14, 2004, the Company completed a $150 million private placement of Senior Unsecured Notes over a term of twelve (12) years (2004 Senior Notes). On June 9, 2010, the Company entered into a new credit facility agreement and amended its 2004 Senior Notes. The new credit facility agreement has a borrowing capacity of $150 million with an optional $50 million accordion feature, has a term of four (4) years, bears interest at either Prime or LIBOR plus a borrowing margin and initially required a maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.5 to 1 and a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 2.25 to 1 (which decreased 1.4 to 1 in the fourth quarter of 2012). The credit facility and amended 2004 Senior Notes are secured with collateral including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment and intangible assets.On December 6, 2011, the Company entered into concurrent amendments (collectively, the December 2011 Amendments) to its Amended and Restated Credit and 2004 Senior Note agreements (collectively, the Agreements) in order to provide covenant flexibility. Under the December 2011 Amendments, the Companys minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was amended to 1.2 to 1 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013 and increases to 1.3 to 1 at the end of the second quarter of 2013, and the covenant definition was changed to exclude 50% of scheduled installment payments (previously included 100%) in the denominator of the calculation. Under the December 2011 Amendments, the Companys maximum Leverage Ratio was amended to 3.0 to 1 at the end of the third quarter of 2012. Consistent with the previous agreement, the Companys maximum Leverage Ratio continues at 3.0 to 1 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 through the third quarter of 2013 and decreases to 2.75 to 1 at the end of fourth quarter of 2013. Under the December 2011 Amendments, the Companys annual capital expenditures will be limited to $30.0 million when the Companys Leverage Ratio exceeds 2.5 to 1. In addition, the Company will be subject to certain restrictions in its ability to complete acquisitions, pay dividends or repurchase stock. The interest rate increased on the 2004 Senior Notes by 50 basis points to 7.08%. Capitalized fees incurred in the first quarter of 2012 for the December 2011 Amendments were $0.5 million. During the term of the Agreements, the Company was subject to an additional fee of 100 basis points in the event the Companys credit profile rating decreased to a defined level. Such a decrease occurred during the second quarter of 2012 and the Company incurred an additional fee of $1.1 million to its Senior Note holders, which was capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining life of the Notes as an adjustment to interest expense.The agreements require the Company to offer early principal payments to Senior Note holders and credit facility investors (only in the event of default) based on a ratable percentage of each fiscal years excess cash flow and extraordinary receipts, such as the proceeds from the sale of businesses. Under the Agreements, if the Company sells a business, it is required to offer a percentage (which varies based on the Companys Leverage Ratio) of the after tax proceeds (defined as extraordinary receipts) to its Senior Note holders and credit facility investors in excess of a $1.0 million threshold. The excess cash flow definition in the Agreements follows a standard free cash flow calculation. The Company is only required to offer the excess 26Table of Contentscash flow and extraordinary receipts if the Company ends its fiscal year with a Leverage Ratio in excess of 2.5 to 1. The Senior Note holders are not required to accept their allotted portion and to the extent individual holders reject their portion, other holders are entitled to accept the rejected proceeds. Early principal payments made to Senior Note holders reduce the principal balance outstanding. The Company made excess cash flow payments to the Senior Note holders of $2.5 million and $0.4 million in the second quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. No excess cash flow payment is required to be made in 2013 as the Companys fiscal year 2012 Leverage Ratio was not in excess of 2.5 to 1 as defined in the agreement.At November 3, 2012, the Company had $104.2 million of total capacity and $34.4 million of outstanding loans under the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 2.38%. In addition to the outstanding loans, the credit facility borrowing capacity was reduced by several standby letters of credit totaling $11.3 million. The Companys average net revolver outstanding (average revolver borrowings net of cash) was approximately $59.2 million for the year ended November 3, 2012. The Company is restricted to certain levels of expenditures relating to dividends and capital expenditures. The Company had $37.4 million of availability on its credit facility as of November 3, 2012.Interest on the amended 2004 Senior Notes is 7.08% and is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Company may, at its option and upon notice, prepay at any time all or any part of the amended 2004 Senior Notes, together with accrued interest plus a make whole amount. As of November 3, 2012, if the Company were to prepay the full principal outstanding on the amended 2004 Senior Notes, the make whole amount would have been $11.9 million. This amount, updated for the calculation as of the closing of the proposed merger, would be required to be satisfied upon closing. The amended 2004 Senior Notes require equal annual principal payments of $22.2 million that commenced on September 15, 2012, and that are ratably reduced by required early principal payments based on a percentage of annual excess cash flow or extraordinary receipts as defined in the Agreements. The first principal payment was paid in the fourth quarter of 2012 from a combination of cash flows from operations and amounts available under the credit facility. Borrowings under these facilities are classified as long term because the Company has the ability and intent to keep the balances outstanding over the next twelve (12) months.The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of November 3, 2012. While the Company was in compliance with its covenants and currently expects to be in compliance with its covenants during the next twelve months, the Companys failure to comply with its covenants or other requirements of its financing arrangements is an event of default and could, among other things, accelerate the payment of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.27Table of ContentsNon GAAP ReconciliationsThe following table reconciles operating earnings (loss) (GAAP) to operating earnings excluding special items (Non GAAP), net earnings (loss) from continuing operations (GAAP) to net earnings from continuing operations excluding special items (Non GAAP) and net earnings (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share (GAAP) to net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding special items (Non GAAP):(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)2012 2011 2010Operating earnings (loss) (GAAP)$15,613 $(21,286) $(61,136)Goodwill impairment 40,455 56,149Restructuring and exit costs2,521 2,184 7,290Other intangible and fixed asset impairments 13,674Merger and transaction costs6,901 Foreign exchange (gains)/losses(588) (220) 2,146CEO separation costs 1,369Special items subtotal8,834 42,419 80,628Operating earnings excluding special items (Non GAAP)$24,447 $21,133 $19,492 Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations (GAAP)$2,687 $(23,383) $(49,643)Goodwill impairment, net of tax 28,435 45,033Restructuring and exit costs, net of tax1,866 1,354 4,454Other intangible and fixed asset impairments, net of tax 8,319Merger and transaction costs, net of tax4,486 Foreign exchange (gains)/losses, net of tax(435) (154) 1,507CEO separation costs, net of tax 833Debt extinguishment costs, net of tax 456Tax benefits from restructuring of foreign operations (4,401)Special items subtotal5,917 29,635 56,201Net earnings from continuing operations excluding special items (Non GAAP)$8,604 $6,252 $6,558 Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share (GAAP)$0.09 $(0.76) $(1.63)Goodwill impairment, net of tax 0.93 1.47Restructuring and exit costs, net of tax0.06 0.04 0.15Other intangible and fixed asset impairments, net of tax 0.27Merger and transaction costs, net of tax0.15 Foreign exchange (gains)/losses, net of tax(0.02) (0.01) 0.05CEO separation costs, net of tax 0.03Debt extinguishment costs, net of tax 0.01Tax benefits from restructuring of foreign operations (0.14)Special items subtotal0.19 0.96 1.84Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding special items (Non GAAP)$0.28 $0.20 $0.21The following table reconciles operating earnings (loss) (GAAP) to operating earnings (loss) excluding special items (Non GAAP) by segment (in thousands):28Table of Contents 2012Segment Operating (Loss) Earnings (GAAP) Special Items Operating Earnings (Loss) ExcludingSpecial Items (Non GAAP)Custom Sheet and Rollstock $29,342 $1,054 $30,396Packaging Technologies 18,006 18,006Color and Specialty Compounds 7,544 1,467 9,011Corporate (39,279) 6,313 (32,966)Total $15,613 $8,834 $24,447 2011Segment Operating (Loss) Earnings (GAAP) Special Items Operating Earnings (Loss) ExcludingSpecial Items (Non GAAP)Custom Sheet and Rollstock $(16,145) $41,064 $24,919Packaging Technologies 23,580 247 23,827Color and Specialty Compounds 2,000 1,322 3,322Corporate (30,721) (214) (30,935)Total $(21,286) $42,419 $21,133 2010Segment Operating Earnings (Loss) (GAAP) Special Items Operating Earnings (Loss) ExcludingSpecial Items (Non GAAP)Custom Sheet and Rollstock $25,149 $3,295 $28,444Packaging Technologies (30,916) 53,483 22,567Color and Specialty Compounds (17,983) 20,244 2,261Corporate (37,386) 3,606 (33,780)Total $(61,136) $80,628 $19,492Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 3, 2012 and the estimated payments due by period:Contractual Obligations (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year Years 2 & 3 Years 4 & 5 Greater than 5 YearsDebt obligations (principal and interest) $148,946 $29,475 $87,603 $31,868 $Capital lease obligations 3,794 421 987 1,115 1,271Operating lease obligations 15,275 4,391 6,226 1,763 2,895Purchase obligations 87,540 81,689 5,842 9 Take or pay obligations 7,072 7,072 Total $262,627 $123,048 $100,658 $34,755 $4,166Amounts included in long term debt include principal and interest payments. Interest on debt with variable rates was calculated using the current rate of that particular debt instrument at November 3, 2012. As discussed above, certain of our long term debt agreements are subject to mandatory prepayments, which include prepayments based on amounts of excess cash flow and from the net cash proceeds of asset sales. Because mandatory prepayments are based on future operating results and events, we cannot predict the amount or timing of such prepayments. No excess cash flow payment is required to be made in 2013 as the Companys fiscal year 2012 Leverage Ratio was not in excess of 2.5 to 1 as defined in the agreement. Actual amounts of interest may vary depending on principal prepayments and changes in variable interest rates. Purchase and take or pay obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements. The table does not include long term contingent liabilities, deferred compensation obligations and liabilities related to deferred taxes because the Company is not certain when these liabilities will become due. 29Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we must select and apply various accounting policies. Our most significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In order to apply our accounting policies, we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. In making such estimates, we rely on historical experience, market and other conditions, and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue as product is shipped and title passes to the customer. We manufacture our products either to standard specifications or to custom specifications agreed upon with the customer in advance, and we inspect our products prior to shipment to ensure that these specifications are met. We monitor and track product returns and the corresponding provisions established. Despite our efforts to improve our quality and service to customers, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same or better return rates than we have in the past. Any significant increase in returns could have a material negative impact on our operating results.Allowance for Doubtful Trade ReceivablesWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers creditworthiness, as determined by our review of their current credit information. We monitor market and economic conditions as well as collections and payments from our customers. We maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical write off experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and market and economic conditions. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, actual credit loss rates may differ from our estimates. Any significant increase in credit losses in excess of our expectations could have a material negative impact on the value of our trade receivables and operating results and cash flows. Inventory Valuation and Obsolescence We value inventories at the lower of (i) cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or (ii) the current estimated market value of the inventory. We also buy scrap and recyclable material (including regrind material) to be used in future production. We record these inventories initially at purchase price, and based on the inventory aging and other considerations for realizable value, we write down the carrying value to realizable value where appropriate. We review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete inventory. A significant increase in the demand for our raw materials could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases, while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, most of our business involves the manufacture of custom products, where the loss of a specific customer could increase the amount of excess or obsolete inventory on hand. Although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and operating results.Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major additions and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. In compliance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets, such assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. Such impairment tests compare estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its fair value or, if fair value is not readily determinable, to an estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows, and a corresponding loss is recorded. The accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of fixed asset impairments and the factors which led to these impairments. Goodwill We follow the guidance of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in recording goodwill arising from a business combination as the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that benefits from the acquired business. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date is the first day of the Companys fourth quarter. In addition, a goodwill impairment assessment is performed if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. The 30Table of Contentsgoodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires the Company to make assumptions regarding fair value. The first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using a number of factors, including projected future operating results and business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates, the allocation of shared or corporate items and comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The estimated fair values of each reporting unit are compared to the respective carrying values, which includes allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill. This determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the recorded and unrecorded assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount. Management believes the estimates of the underlying components of fair value are reasonable. The accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of goodwill impairments and the factors that led to these impairments. Other Intangible Assets Costs allocated to customer relationships, product formulations and other intangible assets are based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. The cost of other intangible assets is amortized on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful life ranging from two (2) to nineteen (19) years. In accordance with the ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, all amortizable intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss. Such an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible asset. If the review indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is reduced by the estimated cash flow shortfall on a discounted basis, and a corresponding loss is recorded. The accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of intangible asset impairments and the factors that led to these impairments. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognized for credit and net operating loss carryforwards and then assessed to determine the likelihood of realization. Valuation allowances are established to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. Expectations of future earnings, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the ability to carry back losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year, and tax planning strategies are the primary drivers underlying our evaluation of valuation allowances. Deferred tax amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable and expensed if our estimates of future earnings and outcomes of tax planning strategies are ultimately inaccurate. Deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings on foreign consolidated subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time. If those undistributed foreign earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, we would be required to recognize additional income tax expense.The Company accounts for income taxes under the updated provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this topic of the ASC, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Tax authorities regularly examine the companys returns in the jurisdictions in which Spartech does business. Management regularly assesses the tax risk of the companys return filing positions and believes its accruals for uncertain tax benefits are adequate as of November 3, 2012.Litigation and Other Contingencies We are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including environmental matters. Management routinely assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to those matters, as well as ranges of probable losses, to the extent losses are reasonably estimable. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, accruals for such contingencies are recorded to the extent that management concludes their occurrence is probable and the financial impact, should an adverse outcome occur, is reasonably estimable. Disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, past experience, interpretation of relevant laws or regulations and the specifics and status of each matter. If the assessment of the various factors changes, the estimates may change. That may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual. Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals and, therefore, could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a future reporting period.31Table of ContentsRestructuring and Exit CostsThe Company follows the guidance of ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, in recognizing restructuring costs related to exit or disposal cost obligations. Detailed documentation is maintained and updated to ensure that accruals are properly supported. If management determines that there is a change in estimate, the accruals are adjusted to reflect this change.Merger and Transaction CostsIn conjunction with the definitive merger agreement under which PolyOne Corporation will acquire all the outstanding shares of Spartech, the Company has incurred various costs triggered by and directly related to the merger transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Spartech recognized $6.9 million of merger and transaction costs, including stock compensation expense from the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding equity awards, legal and financial adviser fees, and other costs directly related to the proposed merger transaction.For additional information regarding our significant accounting policies, as well as the impact of recently issued accounting standards, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate RiskWe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities. Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt facilities. At November 3, 2012, we had $42.4 million of debt subject to variable short term interest rates and $92.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. Based upon the November 3, 2012 balance of the floating rate debt, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would cause an estimated $0.1 million impact on annual interest expense. We are not currently engaged in any interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to changes in interest rates and the November 3, 2012 fair values of such instruments are disclosed in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We are also exposed to market risk through changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including the Canadian dollar, euro and Mexican peso. Based upon our November 3, 2012 currency exposures, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar, euro and Mexican peso would cause a decrease in future earnings of approximately $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively.Commodity Price RiskThe Company uses certain commodities, primarily plastic resins, in its manufacturing processes. The cost of operations can be affected as the market for these commodities changes. As the price of resin increases or decreases, market prices for the Companys products will also generally increase or decrease. This will typically lead to higher or lower average selling prices and will impact the Companys gross profit and operating income. The impact on operating income is due to a lag in matching the change in raw material cost of goods sold and the change in product sales prices. The Company attempts to minimize its exposure to resin price changes by entering into indexed product sales pricing contracts with customers and carefully managing the quantity of its inventory on hand. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional disclosures about market risk.32Table of Contents
