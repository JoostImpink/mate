ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements discussion and analysis (MDA) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements of Rent Way. The purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the financial statements. RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company has restated the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2004, and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company has also restated quarterly financial information for fiscal 2004 and for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis gives effect to these restatements. On February 7, 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a letter to the Center for Public Company Audit Firms of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which clarified existing generally accepted accounting principles applicable to leases and leasehold improvements. After conducting an internal review of its lease accounting procedures, the Company determined that its historical accounting for leases was not consistent with the accounting principles described in the SECs letter. The Company has restated its financial statements for prior periods to correct these errors. In determining to restate, the Company reviewed the accounting for rent holidays, lives used in the calculation of the depreciation of leasehold improvements and accounting for tenant allowances. The Company recognized the effect of pre opening rent holidays over the related lease terms. Tenant allowances have been reclassified from a contra asset in net property and equipment to other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Tenant allowances have also been reclassified from a reduction of depreciation to a reduction of rent expense in the consolidated statements of operations and from a reduction of capital expenditures to an increase in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The lives of leasehold improvements were adjusted to reflect lease terms with lease extension and renewals if the extension was reasonably assured. In addition, during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company changed its revenue recognition policy from cash to accrual basis of accounting. The Company recorded an adjustment of $2,568, which had the effect of decreasing earnings in that fiscal quarter. The Company reversed this adjustment in the fiscal 2005 financial statements contained in this report. Retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year 2003 have been adjusted by $7,687 for the impacts of earlier periods. These accounting changes reduced net income by $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, increased net income by $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, and resulted in a $7.7 reduction in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year 2003, which reduction gives effect to the impact of these changes on prior periods. See Note 2 in notes to the consolidated financial statements contained at Item 8. of this report for a further discussion of the restatement and a summary of the effects of these changes on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2004, and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. OVERVIEW At September 30, 2005, Rent Way operated 788 rental purchase stores located in 34 states. The Company offers quality brand name home entertainment equipment, furniture, computers, major appliances, and jewelry to customers under full service rental purchase agreements that generally allow the customer to obtain ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of an agreed upon rental period. The Company also provides prepaid local phone service to consumers on a monthly basis through DPI. DPI is a non facilities based provider of local phone service. The Company generates revenues from three categories: rental revenue, prepaid phone service revenue, and other revenue. The household rental business revenues include both rental revenue and other revenue. Rental revenue consists of revenues derived from rental purchase agreements. Prepaid phone service revenue represents revenues from DPI. Other revenue includes revenues related to services offered that complement the rental purchase agreements and the sale of rental merchandise. These revenues include, liability damage waiver fees, Preferred Customer Club fees and revenues from the sale of merchandise. The major components of the Companys cost structure are the cost of rental merchandise and personnel and, to a lesser extent, occupancy, sales and marketing expense and general and administrative costs. Costs associated with rental merchandise are driven by the need to purchase merchandise to maintain the quality and availability of the product mix and to maximize inventory utilization 14 Table of Contents rates. Compensation, incentives, and employee benefits are the main components of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expenses are driven primarily by advertising costs, business development activities, and the development of new service offerings. Other operating expenses include general and administrative costs, which primarily include corporate overhead expenses, costs associated with the information technology infrastructure, and other store related expenses. The Company considers the rental purchase business and prepaid telephone services to be two separate business units. Separate business unit information is presented in Note 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Separate information in this discussion regarding the prepaid telephone service business is not presented except in the discussion of total revenues and cost of prepaid phone service. The Company believes that other items for the prepaid telephone service business are immaterial. Rent Way operates in the highly competitive rental purchase industry in the United States. The Company faces strong sales competition from other rental purchase businesses, department stores, discount stores and retail outlets that offer an installment sales program or comparable products and prices. Additionally, Rent Way competes with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as for attracting and retaining quality employees. Rent Way, along with other rental purchase and retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: cost of merchandise, consumer debt levels, economic conditions, customer preferences, employment, inflation, fuel prices and weather patterns. Through sales, closures and combinations, the number of stores operated by the Company has decreased from 1,062 as of September 30, 2002, to 788 as of September 30, 2005. The following table shows the number of stores opened, acquired, sold, closed and or combined during this three year period. YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, STORES 2003 2004 2005 Open at Beginning of Period 1,062 753 754 Opened 1 2 44 Locations Acquired 1 Locations Sold (298 ) (2 ) Closed or Combined (12 ) (1 ) (9 ) Open at End of Period 753 754 788 FINANCIAL STRATEGIES FISCAL 2006 The management team has renewed its efforts to grow by opening new stores. It will also actively pursue acquisitions to leverage existing infrastructure, enhance revenues and maximize profitability. The company will focus strategies in 2006 on the following items: Continue to increase revenues, profits and cash flows in core stores. Open new stores to leverage existing infrastructure. Actively pursue acquisitions to leverage existing infrastructure. Enhance training and development programs. Emphasize a balanced marketing strategy to differentiate the brand and drive traffic. FISCAL 2005 The strategies for fiscal 2005 were focused on continuing to increase revenues, profits, and cash flows in the Companys core stores. The Company leveraged its existing infrastructure by opening new stores. The Company continued to pursue its long term business plan of becoming the preferred choice for rent to own customers. The Company achieved the following objectives in 2005: Increased its same store performance and controlled overhead costs. Continued the Companys new store growth program and opened 44 new stores. Initiated an intensive study of the industry and customers to further enhance and distinguish the Companys unique brand. Reported net income and improved overall profitability. 15 Table of Contents FISCAL 2004 The strategic priorities in 2004 were focused on returning the Company to profitability and identifying opportunities to leverage existing infrastructure and management. The Company continued to optimize its people and facilities to more deeply penetrate existing markets, prepare to enter new markets, gain competitive advantage through the development of name and brand recognition and provide the rental purchase customer with the opportunity to obtain high quality, state of the art merchandise by maintaining a broad selection of products representing the latest in technology and style. Since the refinancing of the bank credit facility and settlement of the class action lawsuit, the Company shifted its financial strategies to pursue its long term business plan of becoming the preferred choice for rent to own customers. The Company achieved the following objectives in 2004: increased its same store performance, improved collections and controlled overhead costs. featured employees and highlighted the brand identity in its advertising campaigns. conducted customer surveys that provided insight into consumer perceptions of brand and performance relative to competitors. initiated a new store growth program to selectively open new stores in existing markets to leverage its existing management, corporate infrastructure and advertising budgets. There were two new stores opened by September 30, 2004. reported net income and improved overall profitability. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting principles, management must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. The actual results of outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts. These differences are usually insignificant and are included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known. The estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from these estimates. Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is being provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the effective term of the related lease (approximately five years) or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The Company generally assigns no salvage value to property and equipment. Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Historically, impairment losses on fixed assets have not been material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Insurance liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience. Although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these estimates because of the period over which actual results may emerge, such risk is mitigated by managements ability to make changes to these estimates as they occur. An estimate is recorded for the future lease obligation related to closed stores based upon the present value of the future minimum lease payments and related lease commitments, net of estimated sublease income. These estimates may be adjusted for lease terminations in which the Company negotiates an amount with the landlord to terminate the lease prior to lease expiration. Also, estimated sublease reserves offsetting the obligation may become uncollectible. Management is required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making its determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers the evaluation of inside counsel who consults with outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter, as well as known outcomes in case law. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for a discussion of litigation matters the Company faces. The Company completes, with the assistance of an independent valuation firm, goodwill impairment testing, which requires a comparison of the fair value of its reporting units with their carrying amount. This is based on discounted expected future cash flows. The discount rate applied to these cash flows represents the Companys implied cost of debt. If the comparison of a reporting units fair value and carrying amount identifies indication of possible impairment, the Company, with the assistance of an independent valuation firm, determines a total enterprise value based on a combination of the market multiple, discounted cash flow and 16 Table of Contents comparable transaction approaches. This analysis is performed annually, or upon certain triggering events. The Company completed its annual impairment evaluations as well as a separate interim impairment evaluation of DPI and determined that no impairment existed. Management exercises judgment about future results in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The net deferred tax asset after adjustment for deductible goodwill was $79.2 million at September 30, 2005. This asset was fully offset by a valuation allowance based on managements determination that realization of the asset is uncertain. Actual results related to the estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements will emerge over periods of time. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Rental merchandise, rental revenue and depreciation. Rental merchandise is rented to customers pursuant to rental agreements, which provide for either weekly, biweekly, semi monthly, or monthly rental payments collected in advance. Rental revenues are recorded in the period they are earned. Rental payments received prior to when they are earned are recorded as deferred rental revenue; and, a receivable is recorded for the rental revenues earned in the current period and received in the subsequent period. Incremental direct costs related to the origination of these revenues are deferred. Merchandise rented to customers or available for rent is classified in the consolidated balance sheet as rental merchandise and is valued at cost on a specific identification method. Write offs of rental merchandise arising from customers failure to return merchandise and losses due to excessive wear and tear of merchandise are recognized using the allowance method. The Company uses the units of activity depreciation method for all rental merchandise except computers and computer game systems. Under the units of activity method, rental merchandise is depreciated as revenue is earned. Thus, rental merchandise is not depreciated during periods when it is not on rent and therefore not generating rental revenue. Personal computers are principally depreciated on the straight line basis beginning on acquisition date over 24 months. Prepaid Phone Service. Prepaid phone service is provided to customers on a prepaid month to month basis. Prepaid phone service revenues are comprised of monthly service revenues and activation revenues. Monthly service revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the related monthly service period, commencing when the service period begins. The cost of monthly service is also recognized over the monthly service period and is included in cost of prepaid phone service in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Activation revenues and costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the average estimated life of the customer relationship. The Company reviews the average estimated life of the customer relationship from time to time in making this determination of average estimated life. Closed Store Reserves. From time to time, the Company closes or consolidates stores. An estimate is recorded of the future obligation related to closed stores based upon the present value of the future lease payments and related lease commitments, net of estimated sublease income. If the estimates related to sublease income are not correct, the actual liability may be more or less than the liability recorded, and the Company adjusts the liability accordingly. Health Insurance Program. The Company determines insurance liability based on funding factors determined by cost plus rates for a fully insured plan and monthly headcount. The contracted rate is determined based on experience, prior claims filed and an estimate of future claims. An adjustment for over (under) funding of claims is recorded when determinable and probable. Liability Insurance Programs. Starting in 2001, the insurance liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability costs are determined based on claims filed and company experience. Losses in the workers compensation, automobile and general liability programs are pre funded based on the insurance companys loss estimates. Loss estimates will be adjusted for developed incurred losses at 18 months following policy inception and every 12 months thereafter. Adjustments for loss estimates are recorded when determinable and probable. For fiscal years 2000 and 1998, the Company was insured under deductible programs with aggregate stop loss coverage on major claims. Claims within the insured deductible limits that were less than stop loss aggregates, were funded as claims developed using AM Best loss development factors. The fiscal 1999 workers compensation insurance had no aggregate retention and was funded as claims developed using AM Best loss development factors. 17 Table of Contents Operating leases and depreciation of leasehold improvements. Rent expense for operating leases, which may have escalating rentals over the term of the lease, is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial effective lease term. The initial lease term includes the build out period of leases, where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease. The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as a deferred rent liability and is included in the consolidated balance sheets. Construction allowances received from landlords are recorded as a deferred rent liability and amortized to rent expense over the initial term of the lease. The Companys statement of cash flows reflects the receipt of construction allowances as an increase in cash flows from operating activities. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is over the shorter of the effective term of the lease (and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured) or the assets useful economic life (See Note 2 to the Consolidated financial statements). Goodwill. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires that intangible assets not subject to amortization and goodwill be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The annual impairment testing consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The total enterprise value, as determined by an independent valuation firm, represents a combination of the market multiple, discounted cash flow and comparable transaction approaches. Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, including such assets recorded in past business combinations, ceased upon adoption.

COMPANY PERFORMANCE MEASURES Management uses a number of metrics to assess its performance. The following are the more important of these metrics: Same store revenue is a measure that indicates whether the Companys existing stores continue to grow. Same store revenues consists of revenues from stores in the household rental segment that have been operating for more than fifteen months and have had no changes affecting operations during that time, i.e. mergers, dispositions or acquisitions. Stores that experienced mergers, dispositions or acquisitions during that period are not included in the calculation of same store revenues. Same store revenues increased 2.13% for fiscal 2005 versus 5.16% in fiscal 2004. The decline in the percentage increase year over year is attributable to a decrease of 35,000 rental agreements year over year in the Companys core stores offset by offering higher end revenue generating merchandise to customers and increasing rental rates on certain products. Gross weekly rental revenue (GWRR) is a key measure of the Companys growth. GWRR is the total potential rental revenue that could be collected from all active rental agreements based on a weekly payment cycle. This is monitored at the individual store level and Company level. Total GWRR was $8.7 million based on active agreements at September 30, 2005, versus $8.5 million for active agreements at September 30, 2004. This is attributable to the opening of 44 new stores, offering higher revenue generating products, and increasing rental rates on certain products. Performance percentage is a metric that measures store and Company overall operating performance. The Company defines performance percentage as total rental revenue collected as a percentage of total GWRR or, potential revenue. Performance percentage was 89.1% for fiscal 2005 and 89.6% for fiscal 2004. Senior management, as well as store managers, use the Companys computerized management information system to monitor cash collection on a daily basis. Daily cash collections expectations are conveyed to the field and closely monitored by senior management. Rental merchandise depreciation as a percentage of rental revenue plus other revenue has long been an indicator of gross profit margins on rental contracts. The Company uses the units of activity depreciation method for all rental merchandise except computers and game systems, which are depreciated on the straight line method. Under the units of activity method, rental merchandise is depreciated as revenue is collected. Thus, rental merchandise is not depreciated during periods when it is not on rent and therefore not generating rental revenue. Rental merchandise depreciation as a percentage of rental revenue plus other revenue was 26.8% for fiscal 2005 versus 27.7% in fiscal 2004. The improvement in rental merchandise depreciation is attributable to purchasing efficiencies and improvement in managing previously rented merchandise. Operating income of the household rental segment is a key measure that management uses to monitor how revenue growth and cost control measures impact profitability. Operating income of the household rental segment was 8.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2005 versus 9.0% of total revenues for fiscal 2004. This decrease is attributable to the costs associated with the opening of 46 new stores and $2.0 million in losses incurred as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Management believes that an important reason for the Companys positive store level financial performance and growth has been the structure of its management compensation system. A significant portion of the Companys regional and store managers total compensation is dependent upon store performance. Incentives are tied to certain key performance metrics and can be a significant portion of a store managers pay. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Total Revenues. Total revenues increased $11.2 million to $515.9 million from $504.7 million. Rental revenue increased $15.9 million, which is attributable to the opening of 44 new stores, offering higher revenue generating products, and increasing rental rates on certain products. The $15.9 million increase in rental revenue is offset by at $7.6 million decrease in prepaid phone service revenue. Much of the $7.6 million decrease in prepaid phone service revenue is attributable to the loss of 6,000 DPI customers year over year due to an increase in competition. Other revenue increased $2.9 million primarily due to the opening of 44 new stores. This increase is also due to an increase in cash sales of rental merchandise year over year. This increase in cash sales is attributable to continued efforts to better manage older, slower moving merchandise through cash sales rather than write offs. 19 Table of Contents Rental Merchandise Depreciation. Depreciation expense of rental merchandise increased to $133.5 million from $132.9 million for the same period last year. Rental merchandise depreciation as a percentage of rental revenue and other revenue is 26.8% for fiscal 2005 versus 27.7% for fiscal 2004. The decrease is primarily due to the Companys achieved purchasing efficiencies and improvement in managing previously rented merchandise. Cost of Prepaid Phone Service. The cost of prepaid phone service decreased to $10.8 million from $16.4 million. The decrease in costs year over year is due to a general decrease in the customer base year over year. Salaries and Wages. Salaries and wages increased by $4.6 million to $138.8 million from $134.2 million. This 3.4% increase in salaries and wages is primarily attributable to the opening of 44 new stores and a general 3% increase in salaries and wage rates. Advertising. Advertising expense increased $1.2 million, to $21.3 million in 2005 from $20.1 million in 2004. This increase is primarily attributable to advertising expenses for new store grand openings offset partially by a reduction in television advertising. Occupancy. Occupancy expense increased to $37.6 million from $34.0 million. This increase is principally due to general rent increases, increases in maintenance expense resulting from a strategic initiative to improve and make consistent the appearance of the Companys stores, and the opening of new stores. Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses increased by $7.9 million to $117.1 million from $109.2 million. This increase is attributable to an increase in payroll taxes of $1.1 million, automotive expenses of $1.8 million, rental merchandise losses of $2.3 million and legal and professional fees of $1.7 million, some of which is related to opening new stores. This increase is also due to losses of $2.0 million incurred as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, primarily due to the write off of merchandise inventories and store fixtures in areas affected by the storms and the write off of merchandise credits of $2.2 million due to a change in the Companys jewelry vendor. These changes are offset by reduction in health insurance costs of $1.9 million. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.6 million to $28.7 million from $30.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates on borrowings outstanding on the bank revolving credit facility and expiration of SWAP agreements throughout the period. Other Income, Net. Other income was $5.2 million in 2005 compared to $6.4 million in 2004. This change is primarily due to a change in the fair market value of the convertibility feature of the convertible redeemable preferred stock, which resulted in income of $2.4 million for 2005, compared to $1.8 million for 2004. The interest rate swap fair market value adjustments resulted in income of $1.6 million for 2005, compared to income of $3.6 million for 2004. Income Tax Expense. For 2005, the Company recorded income tax expense of $5.4 million. This deferred expense of $5.4 million is a result of the impact of applying SFAS 142. SFAS 142 does not permit the amortization of goodwill for book purposes, but for tax purposes goodwill continues to be deductible and amortizable in accordance with current tax laws. The income tax expense for fiscal 2005 attributable to the impact of SFAS 142 adoption results from an increase to the valuation allowance because the Company no longer looks to the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the tax deductible goodwill to offset its deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The impact of the continued tax deductible goodwill will result in tax expense in future years to the extent the Company has a full valuation allowance. The Company recorded no income tax benefit for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, related to the income tax losses due to the uncertainty of their realization. There are approximately $11.1 million of Federal net operating losses that expire during fiscal years 2005 through 2018. Federal net operating losses approximating $42.6 million, $36.3 million, $48.1 million, $30.0 million, $10.9 million, $35.5 million and $10.3 million expire during fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. The net deferred tax asset after adjustment for tax deductible goodwill of $79.2 million for fiscal 2005 and the net deferred tax asset of $76.8 million for fiscal 2004 has been fully offset by a valuation allowance based on managements determination that their realization is uncertain. Loss From Discontinued Operations. Loss from discontinued operations was $0.4 million in 2005 compared to $2.3 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of the sale of agreements and merchandise of 295 stores to Rent A Center in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2005 and 2004 expenses relate to occupancy charges and write offs on leasehold improvements for store leases not assumed by Rent A Center. The Company continues the process of winding down those leases. Net Income. The Company generated net income of $10.5 million in 2005 as a result of the factors described above compared to a $9.1 million in 2004. 20 Table of Contents Net Income Allocable To Common Shareholders. On June 2, 2003, the Company issued 1,500 shares of convertible redeemable preferred stock for $10,000 per share and a one year option to purchase an additional 500 shares of convertible redeemable preferred stock. The options to purchase an additional 500 shares of convertible redeemable preferred stock were exercised in 2004. See Note 12 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing at Item 8 of this report. The preferred stock dividends and accretion totaled $2.2 million in fiscal 2005 and $1.8 million in fiscal 2004, and are charged to accumulated deficit, but reduce net income allocable to common stockholders. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 Total Revenues. Total revenues increased $14.0 million to $504.7 million from $490.7 million. Rental revenue increased $20.5 million, which is attributable to an increase of 21,000 agreements year over year, offering higher revenue generating merchandise to stores, and increasing rental rates on certain products. The $20.5 million increase in rental revenue is offset by at $10.3 million decrease in prepaid phone service revenue. Much of the $10.3 million decrease in prepaid phone service revenue is attributable to the loss of 10,000 DPI customers year over year due to an increase in competition. There was an increase in other revenues driven by a $2.1 million increase in cash sales of rental merchandise year over year. This is attributable to continued efforts to better manage older, slower moving merchandise through cash sales rather than write offs. Rental Merchandise Depreciation. Depreciation expense of rental merchandise increased to $132.9 million from $122.1 million for the same period last year. Rental merchandise depreciation as a percentage of rental revenue and other revenue is 27.7% for fiscal 2004 versus 26.8% for fiscal 2003. This increase is driven by the purchasing cycle for computer merchandise. The Company added significantly more computers to the portfolio in 2003 versus 2004. There is an entire year of straight line depreciation in 2004 versus a partial year in 2003. Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization of intangibles decreased $1.0 million as compared to the same period last year. This is attributable to the expiration of non compete agreements and customer contracts during the year. Cost of Prepaid Phone Service. The cost of prepaid phone service decreased to $16.4 million from $21.9 million. The decrease in costs year over year is due to a general decrease in the customer base year over year. Also, the Company waived activation fees of a two month sales promotion earlier in the year. Salaries and Wages. Salaries and wages increased by $3.6 million to $134.2 million from $130.6 million. This 2.8% increase in salaries and wages is primarily attributable to a general 3% increase in salaries and wage rates. Advertising. Advertising expense decreased $2.2 million, to $20.1 million in 2004 from $22.3 million in 2003. This decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in radio advertising. Occupancy. Occupancy expense increased to $34.0 million from $32.4 million. The increase is attributable to general rent increases, which approximate 2% per year for new leases entered into with higher rates, and the addition of lease commitments for new stores. Restructuring Costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company formulated a plan to restructure the corporate office through reductions in the corporate workforce to rationalize corporate costs for the stores remaining subsequent to the sale to Rent A Center. As a result of this plan, the Company recorded total pre tax restructuring charges of $3.0 million in 2003. The restructuring costs include $1.0 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $2.0 million of fixed asset write offs in the household rental segment. This restructuring was largely completed by the end of fiscal 2003. Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses increased by $8.5 million to $109.2 million from $100.7 million. This increase is attributable to these items: 1) A $2.1 million increase in service repair costs is due to an increase in merchandise on rent and a Company wide initiative to better care for used merchandise, which increased the store level repair volume. Also, the Company implemented a third party service program for which the associated revenue was recorded in other revenue on the consolidated statement of operations. 2) A $3.0 million increase in liability insurance costs because the fiscal 2004 retroactive refunds were $3.0 million less compared to fiscal 2003. 3) State and local taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1.2 million higher than fiscal 2003 because there was a reversal of a $1.6 million accrual in 2003 and no such reversal occurred in fiscal 2004. 4) Beginning in the three month period ended September 30, 2004, the Company began recording rental merchandise losses on the allowance method. This change to the allowance method had the effect of increasing other operating 21 Table of Contents expenses for a one time adjustment of approximately $1.1 million to set up a rental merchandise allowance reserve on the balance sheet. The Company expects rental merchandise write offs in the future under this new method to be materially consistent with prior years adjustments under the direct write off method. Settlement of Class Action Lawsuit. The Company settled the consolidated class action lawsuit that had been filed in 2000. Under the settlement, the Company paid $25.0 million to the class, consisting of $4.0 million in two year 6% subordinated unsecured notes and $21.0 million in cash, of which $11.0 million was funded from available insurance proceeds. The $10.0 million in cash was funded by the Company, was held in escrow and was classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet at September 30, 2003. The net $14.0 million was expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $2.8 million to $30.3 million from $33.1 million. On June 2, 2003, the Company completed the sale of $205.0 million of senior secured notes, closed a new $60.0 million revolving line of credit and sold $15.0 million in 8% convertible preferred stock though a private placement. The proceeds from these transactions were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Companys previous credit facility. See Note 11 and 12 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing at Item 8 of this report. The decrease in interest expense is attributable to reduced debt levels after the refinancing. Amortization and Write Off of Deferred Financing Costs. Amortization of deferred financing costs decreased to $1.0 million from $3.1 million. This decrease is mainly due to the write off of $1.1 million in bank fees associated with refinancing the Companys previous credit facility in fiscal 2003. There was no such write off in fiscal 2004. See Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing at Item 8 of this report. Other Income , Net. Other income was $6.4 million in 2004 compared to $4.0 million in 2003. This change is primarily due to a change in the fair market value of the convertibility feature of the convertible redeemable preferred stock, which resulted in income of $1.8 million for 2004, compared to an expense of $1.9 million for 2003. These changes were offset by a year over year decrease of $1.0 million in the fair market value adjustments for the interest rate swaps. The interest rate swap fair market value adjustments resulted in income of $3.6 million for 2004, compared to income of $4.6 million for 2003. Income Tax Expense. For 2004, the Company recorded income tax expense of $5.6 million. This deferred expense of $5.6 million is a result of the impact of applying SFAS 142. SFAS 142 stops the amortization of goodwill for book purposes, but for tax purposes it continues to be deductible and amortizable in accordance with current tax laws. The income tax expense for fiscal 2004 attributable to the impact of SFAS 142 adoption results from an increase to the valuation allowance because the Company no longer looks to the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the tax deductible goodwill to offset its deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The impact of the continued tax deductible goodwill will result in tax expense in future years to the extent the Company has a full valuation allowance. The Company recorded no income tax benefit for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, related to the income tax losses due to the uncertainty of their realization. There are approximately $11.1 million of net operating losses that expire during fiscal years 2005 through 2018. Net operating losses approximating $42.6 million, $36.3 million, $48.1 million, $30.0 million, $10.9 million and $35.5 million expire during fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The net deferred tax asset after adjustment for tax deductible goodwill of $76.8 million for fiscal 2004 and the net deferred tax asset of $77.4 million for fiscal 2003 has been fully offset by a valuation allowance based on managements determination that their realization is uncertain. Loss From Discontinued Operations. Loss from discontinued operations was $2.3 million in 2004 compared to $14.2 million in fiscal 2003 as a result of the sale of agreements and merchandise of 295 stores to Rent A Center in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2004 expenses relate to occupancy charges and write offs on leasehold improvements for store leases not assumed by Rent A Center. The Company is in the process of winding down those leases. The fiscal 2003 expense is mainly due to a $8.4 million charge for lease obligations related to vacated stores; a $7.3 million decrease in operating income of the stores due to transition period costs including, but not limited to, rent, utilities, costs applicable to office equipment, costs associated with other employee benefits, workers compensation claims, health care claims and all other costs related to transition personnel and, interest expense of $3.0 million recorded as a result of the sale. Net Income (Loss). The Company generated net income of $9.1 million in 2004 as a result of the factors described above compared to a net loss of $27.4 million in 2003. Net Income (Loss) Allocable To Common Shareholders. On June 2, 2003, the Company issued 1,500 shares of convertible redeemable preferred stock for $10,000 per share and a one year option to purchase an additional 500 shares of convertible redeemable preferred stock. The options to purchase an additional 500 shares of convertible redeemable preferred stock were 22 Table of Contents exercised in 2004. See Note 12 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing at Item 8 of this report. The preferred stock dividends and accretion totaled $1.8 million in fiscal 2004 and $0.5 million in fiscal 2003, and are charged to accumulated deficit, but reduce net income (loss) allocable to common stockholders. The increase is due to a full year of dividends and accretion in 2004 versus a partial year in 2003. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys capital requirements relate primarily to purchasing additional rental merchandise, replacing rental merchandise that has been sold or is no longer suitable for rent and new store openings. The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility and available cash. Cash flows from operating activities The Companys statements of cash flows are summarized as follows (in millions): For the Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 (as restated) (as restated) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 8,879 $ 28,077 $ (26,402 ) Cash flows from operating activities decreased by $19.2 million for 2005 compared to 2004. The following items significantly impacted cash flows between the two years: Increase in rental merchandise year over year of $19.6 million as a result of new store openings. Cash received from income tax refunds of $4.2 million in fiscal year 2004. Cash flows from operating activities increased by $54.5 million for 2004 compared to 2003. The key component of this increase was increased profits in 2004 versus 2003. The following items also significantly impacted cash flows between the two years: Funding of the settlement of the class action lawsuit, which used $10.0 million in cash in fiscal 2003, and $2.0 million in fiscal 2004. Decreases in rental merchandise purchases year over year of $36.3 million as a result of the sale of stores in 2003. Reduction in cash used in discontinued operations of $6.1 million year over year. Cash flows from investing activities. For the Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 (as restated) (as restated) Purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired $ (1,119 ) $ (275 ) $ (259 ) Purchases of property and equipment (13,505 ) (9,308 ) (8,155 ) Purchase at music rights license (400 ) Proceeds from sale of stores and other assets 188 95,589 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (14,836 ) $ (9,583 ) $ 87,175 Purchases of property, plant and equipment accounted for the most significant outlays for investing activities, $13.5 million in 2005, $9.3 million in 2004 and $8.1 million in 2003. The increase in 2005 is mainly due to the build out costs and computer equipment needed to open 44 new stores. The Company received $95.6 million from the sale of stores to Rent A Center in 2003. The Company currently estimates that purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2006 will be approximately $13.0 million. Financing Activities. The Companys cash flows used in financing activities are as follows (in millions): For the Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 Proceeds from borrowings $ 111,000 $ 96,000 $ 667,423 Payments on borrowings (92,028 ) (109,014 ) (730,143 ) Payments on class action lawsuit note payable (2,000 ) (2,000 ) 23 Table of Contents For the Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 Payments on capital leases (7,031 ) (8,070 ) (8,282 ) Proceeds from convertible preferred stock 5,000 14,119 Deferred financing costs (35 ) (8,579 ) Issuance of common stock 638 1,019 514 Dividends paid (1,595 ) (1,285 ) (99 ) Interest on shareholder loans (3 ) Payment of loans by directors/shareholders 285 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 8,984 $ (18,385 ) $ (64,765 ) Proceeds and payments on borrowings included both short term and long term financing activities. On September 30, 2005, the Company had $38.0 million available of its $60.0 million bank revolving credit facility. The outstanding balance on the bank revolving credit facility was $19.0 million and there were $3.0 million in letters of credit drawn against the revolver. On June 2, 2003, the Company completed the sale of $205.0 million of senior secured notes, closed a $60.0 million revolving line of credit facility and sold $15.0 million in newly authorized 8% redeemable convertible preferred stock through a private placement. The net proceeds of the offerings, together with borrowing under the new revolving credit facility and the net proceeds of the sale of the redeemable convertible preferred stock repaid all amounts outstanding under the Companys previous senior bank credit facility. As a result of the completion of the refinancing, the Companys corporate credit rating was revised by Standard and Poors Rating Services from CCC to B. The Company paid $8.6 million in deferred financing costs related to this refinancing. The terms and covenants of the secured notes bank revolving credit facility are discussed in Note 11 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing at Item 8 of this report. The Company is in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2005, and expects to be able to comply with those covenants in fiscal 2006. In December 2004, the Company amended its bank credit facility to change the financial covenants to allow for the effect of opening new stores. The leverage ratio and minimum financial EBITDA covenants were amended as shown in the financial covenants required under the credit facility in the following section. In November 2005, the Company amended its bank credit facility to change financial covenants to allow for the effect of opening and acquiring new stores. The leverage ratio, capital expenditures and minimum financial EBITDA covenants are amended as shown below. The secured notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Companys ability to incur additional debt, make restricted payments, incur any additional liens, sell certain assets, pay dividend distributions from restricted subsidiaries, transact with affiliates, conduct certain sale and leaseback transactions and use excess cash flow. The terms of the Companys revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes do not fully prohibit the Company or its subsidiaries from incurring additional debt. As a result, the Company may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. The financial covenants required under the credit facility are as follows: The leverage ratio is total funded debt less an amount on deposit in the excess cash flow escrow account to EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters then ended. As of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending during each of the periods specified below, the leverage ratio at such time should not be greater than: Shall Not Exceed Credit Agreement as Amended Credit of Agreement as of September 30, November 18, From and Including To and Including 2005 2005 July 1, 2005 December 31, 2005 4.75 to 1.00 January 1, 2006 March 31, 2006 4.50 to 1.00 April 1, 2006 June 30, 2006 4.25 to 1.00 July 1, 2006 Credit Agreement 3.75 to 1.00 Termination Date December 31, 2005 5.25 to 1.0 January 1, 2006 June 30, 2006 5.75 to 1.0 July 1, 2006 December 31, 2006 5.00 to 1.0 January 1, 2007 June 30, 2007 4.50 to 1.0 July 1, 2007 Thereafter 4.25 to 1.0 24 Table of Contents The fixed charge coverage ratio is EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters then ended less capital expenditures not financed by capital leases to fixed charges for the same four fiscal quarters then ended. EBITDA does not include depreciation of rental merchandise and is adjusted for one time non cash charges as defined. Fixed charges are the sum of all principal payments made on indebtedness, but excluding payments on revolving credit, plus interest expense, restricted payments, all prepayments on senior notes and income taxes paid or payable. The fixed charge coverage ratio shall not be less than 1.20 to 1.00 from October 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004 and 1.25 to 1.00 from April 1, 2004 through June 2, 2008. The Company cannot allow the book value of rental merchandise under lease to be less than 74% of the total value of rental merchandise held for rent at the end of each calendar month ending September 30, October 31 and November 30 in each fiscal year and 77% for all other calendar months in each fiscal year. The value of idle jewelry cannot exceed 7.5% of the total value of rental merchandise as measured at the end of each calendar month. Prior to November 2005, the Company could not incur capital expenditures in an amount in excess of $20 million in the aggregate during any fiscal year. The $20 million maximum was increased for any unused preceding year permitted amount not to exceed $22.5 million in a fiscal year. With the November 2005 amendment, the Company cannot incur capital expenditures in an amount in excess of $25.0 million in the aggregate during any fiscal year. Consolidated net worth shall not be less than $85 million plus 75% of positive net income for each quarter ending on or after September 30, 2003, with no deduction for losses and 90% of any subsequent incremental issuance of new equity securities, other than equities issues in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and capital stock issued to the seller of an acquired business in connection with a permitted acquisition. The Company cannot permit EBITDA for the twelve consecutive calendar months then ended to be less than: For the period: Minimum EBITDA Amended Credit Credit Agreement as of Agreement as of September 30, 2005 November 18, 2005 September 2005 August 2006 $55.0 million September 2006 Each Month Thereafter $60.0 million October 1, 2005 March 31, 2006 $45.0 million April 1, 2006 May 31, 2006 $40.0 million June 1, 2006 August 31, 2006 $42.0 million September 1, 2006 November 30, 2006 $45.0 million December 1, 2006 February 28, 2007 $50.0 million March 1, 2007 May 31, 2007 $52.5 million June 1, 2007 Thereafter $55.0 million Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company is not subject to any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Rule 303(a)(4) of Regulation S K. Contractual Obligations. The following table presents obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts and contingent commitments at September 30, 2005: Due in less Due in Due in Due after Contractual Cash Obligations Total than one year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Debt $ 205,000 $ $ $ $ 205,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) 19,000 19,000 Capital lease obligations 19,409 6,309 12,364 736 Music rights obligation 1,700 400 1,300 Operating leases 94,559 28,111 56,269 9,450 729 Notes payable 29 24 5 Total cash obligations $ 339,697 $ 53,844 $ 69,938 $ 10,186 $ 205,729 (1) Revolving Credit Facility matures on June 2, 2008.

These one year letters are renewed on an annual basis. 25 Table of Contents Seasonality and Inflation. The Companys operating results are subject to seasonality. The first quarter typically has a greater number of rental purchase agreements entered into because of traditional holiday shopping patterns. Management plans for these seasonal variances and takes particular advantage of the first quarter with product promotions and marketing campaigns. Because many of the Companys expenses do not fluctuate with seasonal revenue changes, such revenue changes may cause fluctuations in the Companys quarterly earnings. In the event of a recession or other economic conditions affecting our customer, the Company acknowledges the possibility of a decrease in demand, particularly for higher end products. Increases in prices, including energy prices, may impact the Companys customer base by limiting discretionary spending of its customers and may impact the Company through increased cost of goods and or increased operating expenses. During the year ended September 30, 2005, the costs of rental merchandise, store lease rental expense and salaries and wages have increased modestly. These increases have not had a significant effect on the Companys results of operations because the Company has been able to charge commensurately higher rental for its merchandise. This trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS No. 154 eliminates the requirement to include the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in the income statement and instead requires that changes in accounting principle be retroactively applied. A change in accounting estimate continues to be accounted for in the period of change and future periods if necessary. A correction of an error continues to be reported by restating prior period financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the compensation cost related to share based payments, such as stock options and employee stock purchase plans, be recognized in the issuers financial statements and is effective for all annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt SFAS 123(R) beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion 25 and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) may have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. However, any charges would be non cash and not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys overall financial position. The Company has elected to use the modified prospective method of adoption of SFAS 123(R). For periods after October 1, 2005, the impact of adoption of SFAS 123(R) will depend on levels of share based compensation granted in the future. If the Company had adopted SFAS 123(R) in prior periods, the expense recognized would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. This new requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase, by the same amount, net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets (SFAS 153). SFAS 153 eliminates an exception in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Non monetary Transactions, which provided an exception to the basic measurement principle (fair value) for exchanges of similar productive assets. That exception required that some non monetary exchanges, although commercially substantive, be recorded on a carryover basis. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in cash flows of the reporting entity. This statement is effective for non monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company anticipates no impact. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys major market risk exposure is primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates. As of September 30, 2005, the Company had $19.0 million in revolving loans outstanding at interest rates indexed to the LIBOR rate. The $19.0 million in borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility have variable interest rates indexed to current LIBOR rates. As of September 30, 2005, the Companys interest rate swap agreements had expired and the Company did not enter into any new interest rate swap agreements. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 27 Table of Contents
