ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion in this Report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Companys actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Item 1 of this Report beginning on page 17, and the risks discussed in the "Risk Factors" sections included in the Companys Registration Statement on Form S 1 as declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 1, 1995 (Reg. No. 33 96690). GENERAL Cardiometrics was founded in 1985 to develop a catheter based system for the continuous measurement of cardiac output utilizing Doppler ultrasound techniques. In 1990, Cardiometrics discontinued development of its continuous cardiac output measurement device due to Cardiometrics assessment of the products inability to meet the performance expectations of the market. At this time, Cardiometrics restructured its operations under new management to focus on a new business strategy: the development and commercialization of the FloWire/FloMap system. In 1991, Cardiometrics received FDA 510(k) clearance for its 0.018" FloWire and began marketing and selling the FloWire primarily to clinical research sites in the U.S., Europe and Japan. During 1992, the Japanese Ministry of Health granted the FloWire/FloMap system official reimbursement status, resulting in significant sales growth in Japan and in the U.S., and Cardiometrics received FDA clearance for its 0.014" FloWire. In 1993, Cardiometrics substantially increased its manufacturing capacity, including adding a second shift, to meet significant back orders for the 0.014" FloWire product in Japan. After supplying the FloWire devices to meet the back orders, Cardiometrics adjusted its manufacturing capacity to one shift and reduced its manufacturing headcount. During 1993, increasing uncertainty concerning health care reform slowed capital expenditures on medical equipment in the United States. In response, Cardiometrics changed its U.S. marketing approach in 1994, from a capital equipment focus to an emphasis on routine clinical usage of the FloWire and resulting sales of disposable devices. In the U.S. market, Cardiometrics began offering hospitals the option to obtain the use of the FloMap in exchange for a commitment to purchase a minimum number of FloWire devices per month for a period of one to two years. This change was accompanied by a reduction and reorganization of the U.S. sales force and resulted in a decrease in FloMap sales. In 1994 Cardiometrics continued to invest in clinical outcome studies and to develop its sales and marketing capabilities. In August 1995, Cardiometrics introduced its FloMap II product, a compact version of the FloMap, for installation in each cath lab room, at a lower price point than the portable but freestanding FloMap. In November 1995, Cardiometrics completed an initial public offering of 2,200,000 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $17.6 million. Based on the outcome of the DEBATE clinical study presented in early 1996, Cardiometrics began to focus its sales and marketing efforts on the use of the FloWire to assess post procedural results of angioplasty. To support this new focus, two new clinical studies, DESTINI CFR and DEBATE II, were started in the second half of 1996. In December 1996, Cardiometrics filed a FDA 510(k) premarket notification for the WaveWire/WaveMap pressure system, and its first clinical use was demonstrated in Europe during the same month. On January 26, 1997, Cardiometrics, EndoSonics Corporation, a Delaware Corporation ("EndoSonics"), and River Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware Corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of EndoSonics ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Reorganization Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Cardiometrics (the "Merger"), with Cardiometrics surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of EndoSonics. The consummation of the Merger is subject, among other things, to the 29 30 approval of the Merger by the stockholders of Cardiometrics, at a stockholders meeting currently expected to be held in May 1997 and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions. Cardiometrics has not been profitable since inception and, as of December 31, 1996, had an accumulated deficit of $34.0 million, $24.2 million of which has been incurred since Cardiometrics restructured its operations in 1990. Further growth in the sales volume of Cardiometrics products and the resulting gross profit will be needed to offset future investments in research and development, principally clinical outcome studies, and selling, general and administrative expenses. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain selected statement of operations information of Cardiometrics as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 1995 1994 Percentage of Sales Sales......................................................... 100% 100% 100% Cost of sales................................................. 37 43 47 Gross margin.................................................. 63 57 53 Operating expenses: Research and development.................................... 24 20 33 Selling, general and administrative...................... 62 59 60 Total operating expenses...................................... 86 79 93 Loss from operations.......................................... (23) (22) (40) Interest income (expense), net................................ 7 2 Net loss...................................................... (16)% (20)% (40)% Year Ended December 31, 1996 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1995 Sales. Sales increased 26% during the period ended December 31, 1996 over the period ended December 31, 1995 to $14,003,000 from $11,112,000. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in sales of FloWire units, primarily in Japan and the U.S., and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average realized selling price of FloWire units. These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of AccuTrac, SmartMap and SmartWire units. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased 10% during the period ended December 31, 1996 over the period ended December 31, 1995 to $5,214,000 from $4,730,000. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 37% in the period ended December 31, 1996 from 43% in the period ended December 31, 1995. This decrease was the result of a greater percentage of FloWire sales, which carry higher gross margins than instrument sales. The decrease was also the result of unit manufacturing cost reductions for FloWire devices. These cost reductions were achieved through lower manufacturing overhead cost per unit due to increased volumes. Research and development. Research and development expenses increased 45% for the period ended December 31, 1996 over the period ended December 31, 1995 to $3,279,000 from $2,259,000. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 24% in the period ending December 31, 1996 from 20% in the period ended December 31, 1995. The increase was primarily the result of increased spending on clinical studies, which Cardiometrics includes in research and development expenses. These studies include DESTINI CFR and DEBATE II, which were new studies commenced in 1996 and which will continue in 1997 and 1998. The increase in research and development was also the result of and increased spending for personnel and outside services related to new product development. Cardiometrics plans to continue its expenditures in research and development, including additional clinical studies. 30 31 Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 33% in the period ended December 31, 1996 over the period ended December 31, 1995 to $8,682,000 from $6,549,000. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 62% in the period ending December 31, 1996 from 59% in the period ended December 31, 1995. This increase relates primarily to expenses associated with increased sales volumes, marketing programs, external corporate reporting and increased staffing and associated expenses. Year Ended December 31, 1995 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1994 Sales. Sales increased 23% during the period ended December 31, 1995 over the period ended December 31, 1994 to $11,112,000 from $9,006,000. This was primarily the result of an increase in the average realized selling price for the FloWire units and, to a lesser extent, an increase in sales volume of FloWire units and to the introduction of the AccuTrac angioplasty guide wire. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased 12% during the period ended December 31, 1995 over the period ended December 31, 1994 to $4,730,000 from $4,213,000. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 43% in the period ended December 31, 1995 from 47% in the period ended December 31, 1994. This decrease is principally the result of unit manufacturing cost reductions for FloWire devices. These cost reductions were achieved through lower manufacturing overhead cost per unit due to increased volumes and manufacturing efficiencies, such as Just In Time techniques to reduce throughput time, improved yields, reduced scrap costs and out sourcing of non proprietary fabrication and assembly processes. Research and development. Research and development expenses decreased 24% for the period ended December 31, 1995 over the period ended December 31, 1994 to $2,259,000 from $2,960,000. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 20% in the period ending December 31, 1995 from 33% in the period ended December 31, 1994. The decrease was primarily due to a temporary reduction in spending on clinical studies, which Cardiometrics includes in research and development expenses, as a result of the completion of patient recruitment for major studies started in 1993 and 1994. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% in the period ended December 31, 1995 over the period ended December 31, 1994 to $6,549,000 from $5,375,000. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1%. The increase in selling and marketing expenses relates primarily to increased sales volume and additional sales and marketing programs commenced in late 1994 and early 1995. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Since inception, Cardiometrics has financed its operations primarily through the private sales of equity securities, raising approximately $38.5 million, and through an initial public offering in November 1995 with net proceeds of approximately $17.6 million. In addition, Cardiometrics has financed a substantial portion of its capital equipment requirements to date through notes payable issued under a $1.5 million equipment loan and security agreement. In 1996, 1995 and 1994, Cardiometrics cash used in operations was $2,761,000, $2,717,000 and $3,134,000, respectively. The decrease in cash used in operations from 1994 to 1996 was primarily due to increases in product sales and gross margin improvements which were partially offset by increases in net inventory and accounts receivable. At December 31, 1996, Cardiometrics principal sources of liquidity included an aggregate of $17,439,000 in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Cardiometrics expects to incur substantial additional costs, including costs related to sales and marketing and research and development, including additional clinical outcome studies and the purchase of capital equipment. Cardiometrics believes that the remaining net proceeds of the November 1995 initial public offering will provide sufficient funds for Cardiometrics anticipated funding requirements through at least 1997 and for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that Cardiometrics will not require additional financing, or that if required, such financing will be available on terms acceptable to Cardiometrics. 31 32
