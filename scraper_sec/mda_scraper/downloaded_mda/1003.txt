Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NOTE: For a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, and some of the risks that could affect future results, see Risks That Could Affect Future Results. This section should also be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, which immediately follow this section. Overview Transmeta Corporation develops and licenses innovative computing, microprocessor and semiconductor technologies and related intellectual property. Founded in 1995, we first became known for designing, developing and selling our highly efficient x86 compatible software based microprocessors, which deliver a balance of low power consumption, high performance, low cost and small size suited for diverse computing platforms. We are presently focused on developing and licensing our advanced power management technologies for controlling 20 Table of Contents leakage and increasing power efficiency in semiconductor and computing devices, and in licensing our computing and microprocessor technologies to other companies. From our inception in 1995 through our fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, our business model was focused primarily on designing, developing and selling highly efficient x86 compatible software based microprocessors. Since introducing our first family of microprocessor products in January 2000, we derived the majority of our revenue from selling our microprocessor products. In 2003, we began diversifying our business model to establish a revenue stream based upon the licensing of certain of our intellectual property and advanced computing and semiconductor technologies. Although we believe that our products deliver a compelling balance of low power consumption, high performance, low cost and small size, we did not generate product revenue sufficient to sustain that line of business. Consequently, in 2005 we put most of our microprocessor products to End of Life status and began modifying our business model to further leverage our intellectual property rights and to increase our business focus on licensing our advanced power management and other proprietary technologies to other companies, as well as to provide microprocessor design and engineering services. In 2005, we also entered into two significant and unrelated strategic alliance agreements with Sony and Microsoft, respectively, to leverage our microprocessor design and development capabilities by providing engineering services to other companies under contract. During 2005 and 2006, we pursued three significant lines of business: (1) licensing of intellectual property and technology, (2) engineering services, and (3) product sales. In 2006, we continued to derive significant revenue from our licensing of intellectual property and technologies. In 2006, we entered into and announced a commercial licensing and services agreement with Toshiba Corporation relating to our proprietary LongRun2 technologies for advanced power management and transistor leakage control. The Toshiba licensing agreement is similar to our LongRun2 licensing agreements with NEC Electronics, Fujitsu Limited and Sony Corporation. Those licensing agreements include deliverable based technology transfer fees, maintenance and service fees, and subsequent royalties on products incorporating the licensed technologies. We intend to continue our efforts to license our advanced power management technologies to other companies, and we are also working to license our intellectual property and microprocessor and computing technologies to other companies. We cannot assure you that in 2007 we will enter any additional licensing agreements or generate any royalties under our existing licensing agreements. In 2006, we also derived significant revenue from our performance of engineering services under our contracts with Sony Group and Microsoft, but we completed the vast majority of that services work by the end of 2006, and we expect to have successfully completed all of our services work under those agreements, on schedule, on or before March 31, 2007. The demand for our engineering services has been unpredictable and varied from quarter to quarter, and we experienced significant reductions in the demand for our engineering services in 2006 due to our completion of major programs and our customers declining needs for such services. The billable time for our services engineers declined to the point where the cash generated by our services business was no longer sufficient to cover the costs associated with that business. In spite of our successful execution on our services work, we determined that the high cost structure and low growth potential of our engineering services business is not consistent with our business model in 2007. Therefore, we have decided not to pursue engineering services as a separate line of business. Accordingly, in February 2007 we initiated a restructuring plan to realign our headcount and expenses with our core business of licensing technology and intellectual property. In 2006, we derived only minimal product revenue from sales of our Crusoe and Efficeon microprocessor products, and we do not expect any additional product revenue from sales of those products in the future. We placed our Crusoe and 130 nanometer Efficeon products on End of Life status in the first quarter of 2005 and supported our customer programs through the end of 2005. We continued to sell and support our 90 nanometer Efficeon microprocessor products in 2006. In June 2006, we entered into an agreement with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), providing for AMD to distribute, on an exclusive basis worldwide, a special version of our 90 nanometer Efficeon microprocessor designed for Microsofts FlexGo technology. In 2006, we built our inventory of 90 nanometer Efficeon products in anticipation of a ramp in demand resulting from the Microsoft FlexGo program, but our sales of 90 nanometer Efficeon products were minimal during 2006 and we have not received any production orders for our special FlexGo enabled Efficeon products. Accordingly, we recorded an inventory write down for our remaining 90 nanometer Efficeon products as of December 31, 2006. As part of the restructuring plan that we announced in February 2007, we will have reduced our workforce and effectively ceased our operations relating to 21 Table of Contents microprocessor production support as of March 31, 2007. As a consequence of these restructuring activities, we believe that we have exited the business of selling microprocessor products. As a result of our 2006 operations, we reported total revenue of $48.6 million, a $24.1 million decrease compared to $72.7 million for the 2005 year. Our total revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in product revenue of $22.9 million and license revenue of $9.6 million, partially offset by an increase in service revenue of $8.4 million. As a percentage of total revenue, our overall gross margin was 50.1% in fiscal 2006, compared to 61.0% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in gross margin was due to a decrease in product revenues and license revenues, partially offset by an increase in service revenues. The decrease was also due to an impairment charge of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 relating to certain product inventory that had been built in anticipation of demand resulting from the Microsoft FlexGo program. Our product revenue decreased from $24.6 million in 2005 to $1.7 million in 2006, with gross margins of 50.2% and negative 25.8%, respectively. The decrease in our product revenue is primarily attributable to the depletion of our inventory of legacy microprocessor products that we put to End of Life status in January 2005. Our license revenue decreased from $19.6 million to $10 million, but gross margin for both years remain the same at 99.6%. The decrease in license revenue reflects the fact that we granted one new LongRun2 license in 2006 as compared to two such licenses in 2005. Our service revenues increased from $28.5 million to $36.9 million with a gross margin of 40.2% in 2006 and 43.8% in fiscal 2005. Our total operating expenses were $49.9 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $51.5 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the Companys total operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in the selling and administrative costs resulting from a decrease of $1.0 million in Compensation and Benefits, a decrease of $2.2 million in temporary and contractual services, a decrease of $1.3 million in salaries for Research and Development, a decrease of $0.3 million in depreciation, a decrease of $0.5 million in corporate insurance and a decrease of $0.2 million in various Selling and Administrative items, offset by an increase of $4.0 million in stock based compensation. In fiscal 2006, we incurred a net loss of $23.5 million while we generated negative cash flows from operations of $19.9 million. This compares to fiscal 2005 in which we incurred a net loss of $6.2 million and positive cash flows from operations of $5.6 million. Our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances were $41.6 million at December 31, 2006, as compared to $56.5 million at December 31, 2005. As we announced publicly in February 2007, we are streamlining and restructuring our operations to focus on our core business of developing and licensing intellectual property and technology. Under our current restructuring plan, we expect to reduce our overall operating expenses to align with our current intellectual property and technology licensing opportunities, and we believe that as a result of actions taken under that plan, our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, planned capital and research and development expenditures through March 31, 2008. If we are unable to generate cash from operations sufficient to sustain our research and development activities at current levels, or to raise additional operating capital for that purpose, we believe that we would still be positioned to further reduce our research and development spending, to monetize certain of our technology or intellectual property assets, and to focus on licensing our intellectual property assets to other companies so as to continue operations for a period that extends at least through March 31, 2008. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of our management. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management. We believe the following critical accounting policies include the Companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: Maintenance and technical support services revenue; Fixed fee development service revenue and cost of services; and 22 Table of Contents Recognition of time and materials based design service revenue License and service revenue recognition; Estimation of inventory valuations; Stock based compensation Valuation of long lived and intangible assets; Restructuring charges; and Loss contingencies; License and Service Revenue Recognition. We enter into technology and trademark license agreements, some of which may contain multiple elements, including technology licenses and support services, or non standard terms and conditions. As a result, interpretation on these agreements, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables and the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. We recognize revenue from license agreements when earned, which generally occurs when agreed upon deliverables are provided, customer acceptance criteria has been met, or milestones are met and accepted by licensees and relative fair values of multiple elements can be determined. Additionally, license, and maintenance and service revenues are recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured and if we are not subject to any future performance obligation. Royalty revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty payments from customers. Service revenue is comprised of three sub types: (i) maintenance and technical support services revenue; (ii) fixed fee development services revenue; and (iii) time and materials based design services revenue. Maintenance and Technical Support Services Revenue. We offer maintenance and technical support services to our LongRun2 licensees. We recognize revenue from maintenance agreements based on the fair value of such agreements over the period in which such services are rendered. Technical support services are provided based on engineering time based on mutually agreed billing rates. Fixed Fee Development Service Revenue and Cost of Services. In the first and second quarter of fiscal 2006, we recognized our service revenue and the associated costs as the project was completed and we have met all of our obligations in connection with the engineering and development services and have obtained customer acceptance for all the deliverables. Recognition of Time and Materials Based Design Services Revenue and Related Costs. Beginning from the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we began providing design and engineering services under a significant design services agreement to work on advanced third party technical projects. We recognize revenues and related direct costs, consisting primarily of assigned staff compensation related costs, from service contracts using the time and materials method, as work is performed. We charge the customer fees based on an agreed upon billing rate and the customers also reimburse us for agreed upon expenses. Estimation of Inventory Valuations. Our inventory valuation policy stipulates that we write down or write off our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory at the end of each reporting period. The amount of the write down or write off is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of the inventory based upon reasonable assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required. Conversely, if demand for estimated excess or obsolete materials exceeds our original estimates, or the sales prices for previously written down materials are higher than anticipated, our gross margins would benefit to the extent that the associated revenue exceeds the materials adjusted value. Additionally, as we introduce product enhancements and new products, and improve our manufacturing processes, demand for our existing products in inventory may decrease. Inventory on hand in excess of forecasted demand is not valued. In computing inventory valuation adjustments as a result of lower of cost or market considerations, we review not only 23 Table of Contents the inventory on hand but also inventory in the supply chain pursuant to the non cancelable purchase orders. If we become aware of factors that indicate that inventory associated with these non cancelable purchase orders will be sold to customers below its cost, we accrue such loss as an additional cost of revenue and as an additional accrued liability on the balance sheet. Consistent with this policy, we recorded charges of $0.5 million for fiscals 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For fiscals 2006 and 2005, the Companys gross margins included an impairment charge on inventories of $1.8 million in 2006 and a benefit of $6.3 million in 2005 resulting from the sale of previously written down inventory. Stock based Compensation. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123(R)) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, stock compensation expense for fiscal 2006 includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of SFAS No. 123,Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). Stock compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after January 1, 2006 is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). We recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of four years for stock options. Through December 31, 2005, we accounted for stock based compensation related to employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 and have adopted the disclosure provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and SFAS 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB 123. Had we accounted for stock based compensation related to employee stock based compensation plans using the fair value method as prescribed by SFAS 123, our net loss would have been increased by $11.6 million and $34.8 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Also see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS No. 123(R) and the valuation of share based payments for public companies. We have applied the provisions of SAB 107 in the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Stock compensation expense recorded in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses is the amortization of the fair value of share based payments made to employees and members of our board of directors, primarily in the form of stock options as we adopted the provision of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 (see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation). All of our stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument. We account for stock compensation costs in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) and apply the provisions of SAB 107. We utilize the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock compensation awards, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected life. Historical and implied volatility were used in estimating the fair value of our stock compensation awards, while the expected life for our options was estimated based on historical trends. Further, as required under SFAS No. 123(R), we now estimate forfeitures for stock compensation awards that are not expected to vest. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock compensation. We charge the estimated fair value to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards, which is generally four years for our stock option awards. The Black Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. As our stock option awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options, and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction. There currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the Black Scholes option pricing model or other allowable valuation models, nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values. While our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations, it has no impact on our cash position. 24 Table of Contents The guidance in SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB 107 is relatively new and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and guidance. There are significant variations among allowable valuation models, and there is a possibility that we may adopt a different valuation model or refine the inputs and assumptions under our current valuation model in the future resulting in a lack of consistency in future periods. Our current or future valuation model and the inputs and assumptions we make may also lack comparability to other companies that use different models, inputs, or assumptions, and the resulting differences in comparability could be material. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we measured compensation expense for stock compensation made to our employee and members of our board of directors, primarily in the form of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, using the intrinsic value method provided by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosures as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. We recorded employee stock compensation expense prior to fiscal 2006 for options granted to employees with an exercise price less than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. On November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Accounting Position No. FAS 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards. We have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of the employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Valuation of Long Lived and Intangible Assets. Our policy for the valuation and impairment of long lived assets stipulates that, at the end of each accounting period or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate our long lived and intangible assets for impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the future cash flows the asset is considered to be impaired and the impairment charge recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the fourth quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2004, consistent with this policy, we recorded impairment charges of $0.8 million and $4.5 million respectively, related to certain long lived and other assets associated with our product sales. We continue to periodically evaluate our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144 and acknowledge it is at least possible that such evaluation might result in future adjustments for impairment. Such an impairment might adversely affect our operating results. Determining the expected future cash flows requires management to make significant estimates. We base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from these estimates. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, it could result in lower estimated future cash flows that may not support the current carrying value of these assets, which would require us to record impairment charges for these assets. Restructuring Charges. In fiscal 2002, in accordance with EITF Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring), we accrued for restructuring costs when we made a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identified all significant actions to be taken in conjunction with our response to a change in our strategic plan, product demand, increased costs or other environmental factors. As part of the 2002 restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring charges of $10.6 million primarily related to lease costs and equipment write offs. We recorded restructuring charges of $4.1 million related to a reduction in workforce during the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Our assumptions used in determining the estimation of restructuring expenses include the determination of the period that it will take to sublet our vacated premises, the market price that we would be able to command for the subleased space and the interest rate used to determine the present value of our future lease obligations. Any significant variation in these estimates compared to actual results may have a material impact on our restructuring expenses and 25 Table of Contents our operating results. We reassess the restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of the restructuring activities. The most significant variables of our accrued restructuring costs are the period that it will take to sublet our vacated premises and the market price at which we believe that we will be able to sublet our vacated facilities. For example, if it is determined that the rate for which we are able to sublease our vacated space is less than our assumed rate, our restructuring charges could significantly increase as a result. Additionally, if it takes longer than expected to sublease our vacated space, additional restructuring charges may be incurred. When reassessing our estimates, we incorporate the most recently available industry data regarding relevant occupancy and lease cost rates. We have found that these variables are often difficult to predict as there are many uncertainties related to the commercial real estate market in which we are attempting to sublet our vacated facilities. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we adjusted the balance in our accrued restructuring costs and recorded a recovery of $0.2 million of previously recorded restructuring charges. This adjustment was the result of an update in assumptions regarding the Companys internal use of previously vacated office space, as well as the anticipated length of time before our vacated facilities are sublet to others. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we adjusted the balance in our accrued restructuring costs and recorded a charge of $0.9 million to restructuring charges. This adjustment was the result of an update to certain underlying assumptions regarding the sublease of our vacant facilities in future periods. The assumption had been revised such that we no longer assume that we will be able to sublease our previously vacated space that remained unused as of September 30, 2004. During fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring charges of $1.5 million and $1.8 million, related to a workforce reduction and excess facilities, respectively. We also recorded a restructuring recovery of $1.3 million related to the reoccupation of certain excess facilities previously restructured. During fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million related to excess facilities. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we accrue for a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss. We regularly assess current information available to determine whether changes in such accruals are required. Description of Operating Accounts Total Revenue. Total revenue currently consists of product sales, net of returns and allowances, and revenue from licensing and services agreements. Costs of products. Cost of products consists of the costs of manufacturing, assembly and testing of our silicon chips, and compensation and associated costs related to manufacturing support, logistics and quality assurance personnel. Cost of products may additionally include a component for adjustments to the valuation of certain inventories based on lower demand and average selling prices expected in future periods. Costs of Services. Costs of services is comprised mainly of compensation and benefits of engineers assigned directly to the projects, hardware and software, and other computer support. Cost of services also includes the costs of providing services under the maintenance agreements with the licenses of our power management and other technologies. Gross Margin. Gross margin is the percentage derived from dividing gross profit by revenue. Our gross margin each quarter is affected by a number of factors, including license revenue recognized, competitive pricing, mix, foundry pricing, yields, production flow costs, speed distribution of our products and impairment charges. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research, design and development activities for products and related technologies, as well as the cost of masks, wafers and other materials and related test services and equipment used in the development process. Selling, General & Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related overhead costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel and legal and accounting services. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges resulted from our decision in 2002 and 2005 to cease development and production of a previous generation of microprocessors. The restructuring charges consisted primarily of lease costs, employee severance and termination costs, equipment write offs and other costs. 26 Table of Contents Amortization of Patents and Patent Rights. These charges primarily relate to various patents and patent rights acquired from Seiko Epson and others during fiscal 2001. Impairment Charge on Long Lived and Other Assets. The impairment charge on long lived and other assets was recorded in fiscal 2006 after the restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as well as in fiscal 2004 after the emergence of indicators of impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 related to the expected negative operating margin related to the Companys product sales. This led to the recording of an impairment charge for assets for which the carrying amount exceeded their fair value. Stock Compensation. There were two components to stock compensation expense during these periods. The first component is the amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with options granted prior to November 2000, net of cancellations. The second component is the application of variable accounting for certain stock option grants. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we did not enforce the recourse provisions of certain employee notes associated with option exercises. Therefore, we account for all other outstanding notes as if they had terms equivalent to non recourse notes, even though the terms of these notes were not in fact changed from recourse to non recourse. As a result, we have and will continue to record adjustments related to variable stock option accounting on the associated stock awards until the notes are paid. This variable stock compensation charge is based on the excess, if any, of the current market price of our stock as of the period end over the purchase price of the stock award, adjusted for vesting and prior stock compensation expense recognized on the stock award. Interest Income and Other, Net. Interest income and other, net consist of primarily the interest income on our average cash balances over a given period of time, and a gain from an early extinguishment of a debt from a development partner. Interest Expense. Interest expense is primarily based on interest payments to a development partner, and to a lesser extent, the accretion of long term property lease obligations related to office space that was vacated as part of our 2002 and 2005 restructuring. 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue: Years Ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Product 3 % 34 % 64 % License 21 % 27 % 30 % Service 76 % 39 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Costs of product 1 % 17 % 123 % Costs of license Costs of service 45 % 22 % 3 % Impairment charge on inventories 4 % Impairment charge on long lived assets 7 % Total cost of revenue 50 % 39 % 133 % Gross profit (loss) 50 % 61 % (33 )% Operating expenses: Research and development 41 % 27 % 179 % Selling, general and administrative 44 % 32 % 105 % Restructuring charges 1 % 3 % 3 % Amortization of patents and patent rights 14 % 9 % 31 % Impairment charge on long lived and other assets 2 % 9 % Stock compensation 6 % Total operating expenses 102 % 71 % 333 % Operating loss (52 )% (10 )% (366 )% Interest income and other, net 5 % 2 % 3 % Interest expense (1 )% Net loss (47 )% (9 )% (363 )% Total Revenue Revenues are generated from three types of activities: Product, License and Service. Product revenues consist of sale of x86 compatible software based microprocessors. License revenues consist of deliverable based technology transfer fees from licensing advanced power management and other proprietary technologies. Service revenues consist of design services and development services fees received for either fixed fee or time and materials based engineering services, as well as maintenance support fees. Total revenue, which includes product, license and service revenue is presented in the following table: Total revenue for the comparative periods is summarized in the following table: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Product $ 1,673 $ 24,636 $ 18,776 License 10,000 19,628 9,000 Service 36,877 28,467 1,668 Total revenue $ 48,550 $ 72,731 $ 29,444 28 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. Total revenue was $48.6 million for fiscal 2006 compared to $72.7 million for fiscal 2005. The decrease in our product revenue is primarily attributable to the depletion of our inventory of legacy microprocessor products that we put to End of Life status in January 2005. The decrease in license revenue reflects the fact that we granted one new LongRun2 technology license in 2006 as compared to two such licenses in 2005. Product Revenues. Product revenue of $1.7 million for fiscal 2006 represents a $23.0 million decrease over product revenue in fiscal 2005. The decline was primarily attributable to the depletion of our inventory of legacy products that we put to End of Life status in January 2005. License Revenue. License revenue of $10.0 million during fiscal 2006 represents recognition of license fees related to technology transfers made to our fourth customer pursuant to one of our LongRun2 technology license agreements. The $9.6 million decline in license revenue from 2005 reflects the fact that we granted one new LongRun2 license in 2006 as compared to two such licenses in 2005. Service Revenue. Service revenue is comprised of three sub types: (i) maintenance and technical support services revenue; (ii) fixed fee development services revenue; and (iii) time and materials based design services revenue. Service revenues increased significantly from $28.5 million in fiscal 2005 to $36.9 million in fiscal 2006. This increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to the Fixed Fee Development Service revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2006. Deferred income related to services was zero at December 31, 2006. We recognized all service income in the year 2006. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Fixed Fee Development Service $ 9,838 $ $ Time & Materials Based Contract 27,037 28,217 918 Maintenance and Technical Support Service 250 750 Other 2 Total Services Revenue $ 36,877 $ 28,467 $ 1,668 Fixed Fee Development Service Revenue and Cost of Services. In the first and second quarter of fiscal 2006, we recognized our service revenue and the associated costs as the project was completed and we have met all of our obligations in connection with the engineering and development services and have obtained customer acceptance for all the deliverables. Time and Materials Based Design Service Revenue. Beginning from the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we began providing design and engineering services under a significant design services agreement to work on advanced third party technical projects. We recognize the service revenue and related direct cost of service, the latter consisting primarily of assigned staff compensation related costs, using the time and materials method, as work is performed. As noted above, in prior periods, we recorded the relatively immaterial time and materials based service revenue under the License and Service Revenue caption. Maintenance and Technical Support Services Revenue. We offer maintenance and technical support services to our LongRun2 licensees. We recognize revenue from maintenance agreements based on the fair value of such agreements over the period in which such services are rendered. Technical support services are provided based on engineering time, and the fees are based on mutually agreed billing rates. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. Total revenue was $72.7 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $29.4 million for fiscal 2004. Our revenues increased substantially during fiscal 2005 as we modified our business model during the first quarter of 2005 to increase our business focus on licensing our advanced power management, to provide microprocessor design and engineering services, and lessen our historical focus on designing, developing, and selling x86 compatible microprocessor products. Further, as part of the modification of our business model during the first half of 2005, we have entered into two significant strategic alliance agreements with other 29 Table of Contents companies to leverage our intellectual property rights and our microprocessor design and development capabilities, to realize value from certain of our legacy microprocessor products. Product Revenues. In both fiscals 2005 and 2004, our product revenues consist of two product groups: the older Crusoe chip product line and the newer Efficeon chip line. Product revenue increased by $5.9 million in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. The increase was due in part to an unexpected increase in demand from customers who received notice of our intention to discontinue certain products and to substantially raise the average selling prices (ASPs) on certain other products. In addition, we experienced higher revenues in fiscal 2005 as a result of: Higher unit shipments and ASPs of Efficeon products, which had their first full year of sales in fiscal 2004. Revenue from Efficeon products represented $9.1 million of total product revenue in fiscal 2005, versus $5.4 million of total product revenue in fiscal 2004. Higher unit shipments on slightly lower ASPs of Crusoe product, our first product line. Revenue from Crusoe products represented $15.5 million of total product revenue in fiscal 2005, versus $13.4 million of total product revenue in fiscal 2004. License Revenue. License revenue of $19.6 million was recognized during fiscal 2005, which represent recognition of license fees related to technology transfers made to our second and third customer pursuant to one of our LongRun2 license agreements. The license revenue in fiscal 2004 represents recognition of license fees related to technology transfers made to our first customer pursuant to one of our LongRun2 license agreements. Service Revenue. Service revenue is comprised of three sub types: (i) maintenance and technical support services revenue; (ii) fixed fee development services revenue; and (iii) time and materials based design services revenue. Service revenues increased significantly to $28.5 million in fiscal 2005, versus $1.7 million in fiscal 2004. This increase in service revenue was attributable to our microprocessor design services beginning in the second quarter of 2005 with the Sony Group. As part of our modified business model announced March 31, 2005, we deployed the majority of our engineering headcount in design and development services arrangements. On March 31, 2005, we entered into a design services agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. and Sony Corporation (collectively, the Sony Group), under which agreement we currently provide the design and engineering services of approximately one hundred and forty Transmeta engineers to work on advanced projects for Sony Group. The term of this design services agreement extends to March 31, 2007; however, the services we provide are agreed upon pursuant to specific project agreements with terms of one year or less. Our current project agreements expire by their terms on March 31, 2006, corresponding to Sony Groups fiscal year end. We expect to continue to provide services to the Sony Group until March 31, 2007, and we are negotiating project agreements with the Sony Group respecting such services. However, due to the uncertainty of these negotiations, we cannot assure you that we will extend any of the current project agreements or enter any additional project agreements, or that such agreements, if any, will continue to require engineering services of the same kind or at the same level as we provided in 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Time & Materials Based Contract $ 28,217 $ 918 Maintenance & Technical Support Services for License 250 750 Total Services Revenue $ 28,467 $ 1,668 Maintenance and Technical Support Services Revenue We offer maintenance and technical support services to our LongRun2 licensees. We recognize revenue from maintenance agreements based on the fair value of such agreements over the period in which such services are rendered. Technical support services are provided based on engineering time, and the fees are based on mutually agreed billing rates. 30 Table of Contents Fixed Fee Development Service Revenue and Cost of Services In the first and second quarter of fiscal 2006, we recognized our service revenue and the associated costs as the project was completed and we have met all of our obligations in connection with the engineering and development services and have obtained customer acceptance for all the deliverables. Time and Materials Based Design Service Revenue Beginning from the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we began providing design and engineering services under a significant design services agreement to work on advanced third party technical projects. We recognize the service revenue and related direct cost of service, the latter consisting primarily of assigned staff compensation related costs, using the time and materials method, as work is performed. As noted above, in prior periods, we recorded the relatively immaterial time and materials based service revenue under the License and Service Revenue caption. Customer Concentration Information We have derived the majority of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Additionally, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers located in Asia, which subjects us to economic cycles in that region as well as the geographic areas in which they sell their products containing our microprocessors. The following table represents our sales to customers, each of which is located in Asia, that accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for fiscals 2006, 2005 and 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Customer: Sony Corporation 55 % 52 % Fujitsu America Inc. 16 % Hewlett Packard International Pte Inc 15 % 27 % Microsoft 20 % NEC Electronics Corp. 33 % Sharp Trading Corporation 12 % Toshiba 21 % * represents less than 10% of total revenue Customers who accounted for more than 10% of Transmetas accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 Customer: 3COM Corporation 27 % OQO, Inc. 14 % All American 12 % ASEM S.p.A. 11 % Microsoft Corporation 100 % 12 % Sony Corporation 11 % Hewlett Packard International Pte Ltd. * % Sharp Trading Corporation * % * represents less than 10% of accounts receivable balance Costs of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue, cost of license and cost of service revenue. 31 Table of Contents Cost of Products Our product gross margin is comprised of the components displayed in the following table, shown as a percentage of product revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Product revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Product cost (75.5 )% 72.6 % 90.3 % Underabsorbed overhead 7.2 % 0.6 % 7.5 % Charges for inventory and other adjustments (0.5 )% 2.2 % 98.7 % Benefits to gross margin from the sale of previously written down inventory 86.9 % (25.6 )% (3.0 )% Impairment charges for long lived assets 107.7 % % 10.3 % Cost of product revenue 125.8 % 49.8 % 203.8 % Gross margin (25.8 )% 50.2 % (103.8 )% Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. As a percent of product revenue, our cost of product revenue was 125.8% for fiscal 2006, compared to 49.8% in fiscal 2005. The increase in our cost of product revenue in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 was primarily attributed to Inventory impairment in fiscal 2006, resulting from restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2006. Product gross margins were negative 25.8% in fiscal 2006 compared to 50.2% in fiscal 2005. As previously discussed, positive gross margins were achieved through a combination of higher benefits from previously written down inventories, higher ASP, lower manufacturing costs and higher product demand due to end of life orders. In fiscal 2006, inventories were written down to zero at the close of a fiscal period. We recorded a benefit to product gross margin of approximately $0.3 million for fiscal 2006 and $6.3 million for the fiscal 2005. The $0.3 million benefit to gross margin during fiscal 2006 was associated with the sale of inventory that was previously reserved. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. As a percent of product revenue, our cost of product revenue was 49.8% for fiscal 2005, compared to 203.8% in fiscal 2004. The significant decreases in our cost of product revenue in fiscal 2005 versus fiscal 2004 were primarily attributed to: Benefit derived from sale of previously written down inventory during fiscal 2005 from customers; Lower product cost a result of lower manufacturing costs associated with the Efficeon TM8000 processors, which had higher costs with the introduction of the product in fiscal 2004; Higher charges for inventory adjustments in fiscal 2004 resulted from manufacturing costs expected to exceed the price at which we expected to sell these products. Product gross margins were 50.2% in fiscal 2005 compared to negative 103.8% in fiscal 2004. As previously discussed, positive gross margins were achieved through a combination of higher benefits from previously written down inventories, higher ASP, lower manufacturing costs and higher product demand due to end of life orders. In fiscal 2005, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million to costs of revenue related to the valuation of inventory on hand, which resulted in a reduction of the carrying value of that inventory. As a component of this charge and in computing inventory valuation adjustments as a result of lower of costs or market considerations, we review the inventory on hand and inventory on order. In estimating the net realizable value of the inventory on hand and in determining whether the inventory on hand was in excess of anticipated demand, we took into consideration current assumptions regarding our future plans on its products and the related potential impact on customer demand and average selling prices. Inventories written down to net realizable value at the close of a fiscal period are not marked up in subsequent periods. Of the $0.3 million and $5.4 million of net inventory on hand at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, zero and $2.4 million of net inventory, respectively, were adjusted to their net realizable value. 32 Table of Contents For fiscal 2005, we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for this previously written down inventory from customers who received notice of our intention to discontinue certain products and to substantially raise the ASPs on many of our products. We recorded a benefit to gross margin from the sale of previously written down inventory of approximately $6.3 million for fiscal 2005 and $0.6 million for the fiscal 2004. The $6.3 million benefit to gross margin during fiscal 2005 included (a) $3.3 million in sales to one customer of inventory that had been written down as of December 31, 2004, but was sold during fiscal 2005, because of favorable changes in that customers product specification requirements, and (b) $1.5 million associated with the sale of inventory that was improperly written down in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. We do not expect to realize additional gross margin benefit in future periods from the sale of such improperly written down inventory. Gross margin may be impacted from future sales of other previously written down inventory to the extent that the associated revenue exceeds or fails to achieve the currently adjusted value of that inventory, although the amount is expected to be diminimus. Cost of License Years Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Cost of License $ 39 $ 71 $ The cost of license revenue represents an allocation of compensation cost of engineering support from the LongRun2 group dedicated to completing the transfer of the licensing technology. Cost of Service Revenue: The cost of service revenue is comprised of three sub types: (i) Maintenance and Technical Support Services pursuant to the delivery of LongRun2 licenses; (ii) Fixed Fee Development Services; and (iii) Time and Materials Based Design Services. Costs of service revenue is comprised mainly of compensation and benefits of engineers assigned directly to the projects, hardware and software, and other computer support. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. The increase in costs of service revenue of fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was $6.1 million as a result of a first time occurrence of $5.1 million of fiscal 2006 fixed fee development service costs and $1.8 million of stock based compensation applicable to headcount associated with design and engineering design revenues, partially offset by a $.6 million decrease in fiscal 2006 headcount costs due to a decline in billable contractual design and engineering services and a first time occurrence of $.2 million in fiscal 2005 license related maintenance and support service costs. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. The increase in costs of service revenue of fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was $15.3 million as a result of a $15.1 million fiscal 2005 increment of headcount costs associated with design and engineering design revenues and a first time occurrence of $.2 million in fiscal 2005 license related maintenance and support service costs. Service revenue and the related costs are summarized for 2006, 2005, and 2004 in the table below: Years Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Fixed Fee Development Service $ 5,053 $ $ Time & Materials Based Contract 17,005 15,779 730 License Related Maintenance and Support Services 211 Other 4 Total Cost of Services $ 22,062 $ 15,990 $ 730 33 Table of Contents Research and Development Years Ended December31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Research and development expenses $ 20,120 $ 19,609 $ 52,765 Amount reclassified to costs of service and deferred costs(1) $ 16,321 $ 17,737 $ (1) In fiscal 2006 and 2005, we included costs directly attributable to the design and development services agreements in cost of service revenues. Prior to 2005, such costs were included in the research and development activities as the employees involved with such activities were performing research and development related activities in the prior years. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $20.1 million for fiscal 2006 compared to $19.6 million for fiscal 2005, representing an increase of $0.5 million, as a result of $1.7 million of stock based compensation expense applicable to R&D personnel in fiscal 2006, partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in R&D employee related headcount costs and $0.3 million in hardware and software costs in fiscal 2006. We expect our research and development expense to increase in future periods due to anticipated reallocation of certain dedicated design and development services activities, currently classified as cost of services, and systems engineering and manufacturing support for both our LongRun2 development and further 90 nanometer Efficeon product enhancements for our focused product business. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. Research and development expenses were $19.6 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $52.8 million for fiscal 2004, representing a significant decrease of $33.2 million. Apart from the reclassification discussed above, R&D expenses declined as a result of lower non recurring engineering charges by $7.6 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 as we discontinued certain of our products, and continued to manufacture select models of our 90 nanometer Efficeon processor for critical customers only under modified terms and conditions. We expect our research and development expense to increase in future periods due to anticipated reallocation of certain dedicated design and development services activities, currently classified as cost of services, and systems engineering and manufacturing support for both our LongRun2 development and further 90 nanometer Efficeon product enhancements for our focused product business. Selling, General and Administrative Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 decreased by $1.6 million compared to fiscal 2005. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower compensation and related employee expenses as well as lower temporary and contractual service costs. Included in the selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 was $2.3 million of stock based compensation expense. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $7.8 million compared to fiscal 2004. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower compensation and related employee expenses resulting from lower headcount following the March 31, 2005 restructuring plan, which significantly reduced our sales force and marketing costs. We anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase somewhat in the next several quarters due to additional headcount and accounting costs as the Company is required to comply with Section 404 Managements Internal Controls and Procedures for Financial Reporting of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $14.7 million. We recorded charges of $10.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 consisting primarily of lease costs, equipment write offs and other costs as we identified a number of leased facilities and leased equipment that were no longer required. We recorded severance 34 Table of Contents and termination charges of $4.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 related to the reduction in workforce. Approximately 195 employees and contractors were terminated on July 18, 2002. Other than future lease payments for our vacated facilities, the majority of our restructuring activities have been completed. As a result of our workforce reduction completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we vacated a total of approximately 67,730 square feet of office space in Santa Clara, California. As part of our quarterly reassessment of restructuring accruals, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we adjusted the accrued restructuring balance as a result of an update in assumptions regarding our internal use of previously vacated office space, as well as the anticipated length of time before vacated facilities are sublet to others. As a result of this update, we adjusted the balance in accrued restructuring costs and recorded a benefit of $0.2 million to restructuring charges. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we adjusted our accrued restructuring costs as a result of an update to certain underlying assumptions. We had previously anticipated subleasing our vacant facilities in future periods. In view of market conditions, this assumption had been revised such that we no longer assume that we will be able to sublease our previously vacated space that remained unused as of September 30, 2004. As a result of this update in assumptions, we adjusted the accrued restructuring costs and recorded a charge of $0.9 million in restructuring charges. We may need to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future as circumstances change and as we make our quarterly reassessment. During fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.0 million. We recorded termination and severance charges of $1.5 million related to a workforce reduction during the first six months of 2005 as a result of our strategic restructuring to focus our ongoing efforts on licensing our advanced technologies and intellectual property, engaging in engineering services opportunities and continuing our product business on a modified basis. During fiscal 2005, we recorded a charge of $1.8 million related to excess facilities related to the workforce reduction in early 2005, partially offset by a net restructuring benefit of $1.3 million as we reoccupied a portion of our previously vacated and restructured facilities. During fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million related to excess facilities. We recorded total 2006 lost rent of $0.4 million and change of estimates of $0.3 million. Accrued restructuring charges consist of the following at December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Building Leasehold Workforce Costs Reduction Total Balance Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 6,071 $ $ 6,071 Restructuring charges 904 904 Cash drawdowns (1,730 ) (1,730 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 5,245 $ $ 5,245 Restructuring charges 1,841 1,502 3,343 Adjustments and reversals (1,278 ) (56 ) (1,334 ) Cash drawdowns (1,552 ) (1,446 ) (2,998 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 4,256 $ $ 4,256 Restructuring charges 373 373 Change in estimates 325 325 Cash drawdowns (1,970 ) $ (1,970 ) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 2,984 $ $ 2,984 Amortization of Patents and Patent Rights Amortization charges for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 relate to various patents and patent rights acquired from Seiko Epson and others during fiscal 2001. See Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our technology license agreements and patents and patent rights. 35 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. Amortization of patents and patent rights was $6.8 million for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Amortization charges relate to various patents and patent rights acquired from Seiko Epson and others during fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. Amortization of patents and patent rights was $6.8 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $9.2 million for fiscal 2004, representing a decrease of $2.4 million, or 26.1%. Amortization charges relate to various patents and patent rights acquired from Seiko Epson and others during fiscal 2001. Also included in the amortization charges are accretion expenses associated with the liability recorded from the acquisition of these patents and patent rights. The decreases can be attributed to a decrease in accretion expenses, as the liabilities associated with the patents and patent rights have been either paid in full or accreted to its future value as of December 31, 2004. Impairment Charge on Long Lived and Other Assets During the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded a charge of $0.8 million related to long lived and other assets associated with the product business and was comprised of $0.3 million for property and equipment and $0.5 million for software maintenance prepayments. During the fourth quarter of 2004, due to the emergence of indicators of impairment, we performed an assessment of our long lived and other assets. The assessment was performed in connection with our internal policies and pursuant to SFAS 144. The conclusion of the assessment was that the carrying value of certain assets was in excess of their expected future undiscounted cash flows. As a result, we recorded a charge of $2.5 million in 2004 to write off such assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value, which was deemed to be zero and was based on the expected future discounted cash flows for the Companys product sales. The assumptions supporting the estimated future discounted cash flows reflect managements best estimates and may be affected by future events. The $2.5 million charge in 2004 related to long lived and other assets associated with the product business and was comprised of $1.7 million for property and equipment and $0.8 million for software maintenance prepayments. Stock Compensation Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. Stock compensation was zero for fiscal 2006 compared to negative $34,000 for fiscal 2005. The two components of stock compensation were the amortization of deferred stock compensation and variable stock compensation. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. Stock compensation was negative $34,000 for fiscal 2005 compared to $1.7 million for fiscal 2004. The two components of stock compensation were the amortization of deferred stock compensation and variable stock compensation. Net amortization of deferred stock compensation for fiscal 2005 was none compared to $0.7 million for fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily a result of amortizing the deferred charge on an accelerated method in accordance with our accounting policy. The amortization of the deferred stock compensation, calculated in connection with stock options granted prior to November 2000, was completed in fiscal 2004. Variable stock compensation for fiscal 2005 was negative $34,000, compared to $1.0 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the variable stock compensation component in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily resulted from a higher repayment amount of notes from which such variable stock accounting is applied, as well as a lower market price of our stock as of December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest Income and Other, Net Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. Interest income and other, net for fiscal 2006 was $2.4 million compared to $1.3 million fiscal 2005, representing an increase of $1.1 million, or 89.1%. This increase was primarily due to a higher interest rate earned in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. Interest income and other, net for fiscal 2005 was $1.3 million compared to $0.8 million compared for fiscal 2004, representing an increase of 62.5%. This increase was primarily due to a $0.2 million gain on an early debt extinguishment with a development partner and higher interest income resulting from higher yield on higher cash balances. 36 Table of Contents Interest Expense Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005. Interest expense for fiscal 2006 was $0.3 million compared to $0.4 million for fiscal 2005, representing a decrease of $0.1 million. The decrease in interest expense is due to an IBM note paid off at the end of 2005. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004. Interest expense for fiscal 2005 was $0.4 million compared to $0.1 million for fiscal 2004, representing an increase of $0.3 million. This increase was primarily the result of interest expense paid on a note with a development partner, which note was repaid on December 31, 2005. In addition, and to a lesser extent, interest expense resulted from the accretion of long term property lease obligations related to office space that was vacated as part of our 2002 and 2005 restructuring. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, we had negative cash flows from our operations. Except for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2005, we have historically reported negative cash flows from our operations because the gross profit, if any, generated from our product revenues and our license and service revenues has not been sufficient to cover our operating cash requirements. From our inception in 1995 through fiscal year 2005, we incurred a cumulative loss aggregating $679.0 million, which included net losses of $23.5 million in fiscal 2006, $6.2 million in fiscal 2005, $106.8 million in fiscal 2004 and $87.6 million in fiscal 2003, which losses have reduced stockholders equity to $42.7 million at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, we had $41.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments compared to $56.5 million and $53.7 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. See the financial statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash flows for those periods. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities $ (19,933 ) $ 5,588 $ (77,687 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities (1,457 ) 1,917 (11,301 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 5,326 2,881 31,496 Increase/(Decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (16,064 ) $ 10,386 $ (57,492 ) We believe that if we were to continue under the business model that we pursued during and through our fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash from operations would not be sufficient to fund our operations, planned capital and R&D expenditures for the next twelve months in all three of our significant lines of business: (1) licensing of intellectual property and technology, (2) engineering services, and (3) product sales. Accordingly, and as we announced publicly in February 2007, we are streamlining and restructuring our operations to focus on our core business of developing and licensing intellectual property and technology. In February 2007, we began the initial phase of our restructuring plan by decreasing our worldwide workforce by approximately 75 employees, most of whom worked in our engineering services business, and by initiating closures of our offices in Taiwan and Japan. We expect to further reduce our workforce by approximately 55 employees on or about March 31, 2007, as we complete our existing engineering services work for Sony and Microsoft. Under our current restructuring plan, we expect to reduce our overall operating expenses to align with our current intellectual property and technology licensing opportunities, and we believe that if our actions taken under that plan are successful, our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, planned capital and R&D expenditures through March 31, 2008. If we are unable to generate cash from operations sufficient to sustain our R&D activities at current levels, or to raise additional operating capital for that purpose, we believe that we would still be positioned to further reduce our R&D spending, to monetize certain of our technology or intellectual property assets, and to focus on licensing our intellectual property assets to other companies so as to continue operations for a period that extends at least through March 31, 2008. 37 Table of Contents The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern; however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. In addition to the restructuring plan referred to above, we are currently engaged in discussions with other companies regarding certain potential strategic alliance opportunities that could enable us to leverage our technologies, to raise operating capital and to improve or enhance our business in other ways. Although it is possible that we might raise additional operating capital or create new prospects by means of one or more strategic alliances with other companies, we have no assurance that we will achieve any such strategic alliance or that any such strategic alliance, if achieved, will prove favorable for us or our business. To date, we have financed our operational expenses and working capital requirements primarily with funds that we raised from the sale of our common stock. Although it is possible that we might raise additional capital by means of one or more strategic alliances, or through public or private equity or debt financing, we have no assurance that any additional funds will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If additional funds were to be raised through the sale of equity securities, additional dilution to the existing stockholders would be likely to result. Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities was $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $77.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The net cash usage for operating activities during fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of a net loss of $23.5 million, as well as $2.0 million cash usage related to the building leasehold cost component of our restructuring charges. The usage in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.4 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $0.8 million. The net loss and changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by non cash charges related to amortization of patents and patent rights of $6.8 million, amortization of stock compensation of $5.8 million, depreciation of $1.1 million and non cash restructuring charges of $0.7 million, partially offset by decreases in advances from customers of $5.9 million and deferred income of $5.9 million. The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of non cash charges related to amortization of patents and patent rights of $6.8 million, restructuring charges of $2.0 million and depreciation of $1.3 million, advances from customers of $7.3 million and deferred income of $5.9 million as well as decreases in inventories and accounts receivable of $5.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. This provision in cash was partially offset by a $6.2 million of net loss, a $3.0 million of cash usage related to the workforce reduction and building leasehold cost component of our restructuring charges and a decrease of $14.1 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The cash usage during fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of a net loss of $106.8 million, as well as a $1.7 million cash usage related to the building leasehold cost component of our restructuring charges. This usage in cash was partially offset by the $8.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the $3.4 million decrease in inventory. The net loss and changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by non cash charges related to amortization of patents and patent rights of $9.2 million, impairment charges on certain assets of $2.5 million, depreciation of $3.6 million and stock compensation of $1.7 million. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and to net cash used by investing activities of $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of available for sale investments of $28.0 million, $26.0 million and $75.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Offsetting 38 Table of Contents the available for sale investment were the proceeds provided from the maturity of available for for sale investments of $27.0 million, $33.5 million and $84.5 million, in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional cash was used to purchase property and equipment of $0.5 million, $0.8 million and $2.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Payments made to a development partner were $0, $4.8 million and $11.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Payments made for previously acquired patents and patent rights were $0, $0 and $7.5 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We received $5.3 million in net proceeds from sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans for fiscal 2006, compared to $3.2 million and $5.3 million for fiscals 2005 and 2004, respectively. These proceeds from stock issuances were partially offset by payments for debt and capital lease obligations of zero for fiscal 2006, compared to $0.4 million for fiscals 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in payments for debt and capital lease obligations was primarily the result of the expiration of these leases in fiscal 2003. In addition, cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to net proceeds from the public offering of common stock. In January 2004, we received $10.3 million when our underwriters exercised their over allotment option in relation to our December 2003 common stock offering and purchased 3.75 million shares of our common stock. We also received $15.4 million in November 2004 when we completed a public offering of 11.1 million shares of common stock. Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, from lease financing. It is reasonably possible that we may continue to seek financing through these sources of capital as well as other types of financing, including but not limited to debt financing. Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. At December 31, 2006, we had $41.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We lease our facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring in 2008, and we lease equipment and software under non cancelable leases expiring in fiscal 2006. Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2006, we had the following contractual obligations: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 After Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years 4 Years (In thousands) Operating Leases $ 7,392 $ 4,862 $ 2,526 $ 4 Unconditional Purchase Obligations(1) 2,729 $ 1,262 1,467 $ 10,121 $ 6,124 $ 3,993 $ 4 Less: Sublease income (465 ) (316 ) (149 ) Total $ 9,656 $ 5,808 $ 3,844 $ 4 (1) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Transmeta and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, planned capital and research and development expenditures for the next twelve months. 39 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140, or SFAS No. 155. SFAS No. 155 will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2007. SFAS No. 155 permits interests in hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation, to be accounted for as a single financial instrument at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. This election is permitted on an instrument by instrument basis for all hybrid financial instruments held, obtained, or issued as of the adoption date. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 155 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting For Uncertain Tax Positions An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, or FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007; therefore, we anticipate adopting this standard as of January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, or SAB 108. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006 and addresses how financial statement errors should be considered from a materiality perspective and corrected. The literature provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. Historically, there have been two approaches commonly used to quantify such errors: (i) the rollover approach, which quantifies the error as the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated, and (ii) the iron curtain approach, which quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated. The SEC Staff believes that companies should quantify errors using both approaches and evaluate whether either of these approaches results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. We adopted SAB No. 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation), or EITF 06 3, to clarify diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in the financial statements. The Task Force concluded that, for taxes within the scope of the issue, a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net. That is, it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charge for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales, or, alternatively, it may 40 Table of Contents net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority. If taxes subject to this Issue are significant, a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis. The guidance in this consensus is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of EITF 06 3 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, or SFAS No. 159, which permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This election is irrevocable. SFAS No. 159 will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market, groupings of assets, discount rate and terminal growth rates. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of long lived assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income. As of December 31, 2006, our cash equivalents and short term investments included money market funds and short and medium term corporate bonds and earned interest at an average rate of 5.0%. Due to the relative short term nature of our investment portfolio, our interest income is extremely vulnerable to sudden changes in market interest rates. A hypothetical 1.0% decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a $0.4 million decrease in our interest income. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Fair Value Cash equivalents $ 11,595 $ 11,595 $ 11,595 Average rate 4.9 % 4.9 % Short term investments $ 23,963 $ 5,992 $ 29,955 $ 29,955 Average rate 4.9 % 5.5 % 5.0 % Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. All of our sales and substantially all of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. However, in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases, we may choose to hedge those exposures. 41 Table of Contents
