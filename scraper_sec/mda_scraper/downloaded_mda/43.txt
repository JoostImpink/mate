Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided to assist readers in understanding the Companys financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends which may impact the future performance of the Company. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. This discussion includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed beginning on page 8. Company Products and Operations The Company is a leading global provider of premium products and services used during the drilling, completion and production phases of oil and natural gas development activities. In August 2008, we broadened our capabilities in key drilling and completion related product technologies with the acquisition of W H Energy Services, Inc. (W H). We provide a comprehensive line of technologically advanced products and engineering services, including drilling and completion fluid systems, solids control and separation equipment, waste management services, three cone and diamond drill bits, borehole enlargement services, tubulars, directional systems, measurement while drilling and logging while drilling services, coiled tubing, cased hole wireline and other complementary downhole tools and services. The Company also offers supply chain management solutions through an extensive North American branch network providing pipe, valves and fittings as well as mill, safety and other maintenance products. The Companys operations are driven principally by the level of exploration and production (EP) spending in major energy producing regions around the world and the depth and complexity of these projects. Although EP spending is significantly influenced by the market price of oil and natural gas, it may also be affected by supply and demand fundamentals, finding and development costs, decline and depletion rates, political actions and uncertainties, environmental concerns, the financial condition of independent EP companies and the overall level of 15 Table of Contents global economic growth and activity. In addition, approximately five percent of the Companys consolidated revenues relate to the downstream energy sector, including petrochemical plants and refineries, whose spending is largely impacted by the general condition of the U.S. economy. Capital investment by energy companies is largely divided into two markets, which vary greatly in terms of primary business drivers and associated volatility levels. North American drilling activity is primarily influenced by natural gas fundamentals, with approximately 60 percent of the current rig count focused on natural gas finding and development activities. Conversely, drilling in areas outside of North America is more dependent on crude oil fundamentals, which influence three quarters of international drilling activity. Historically, business in markets outside of North America has proved to be less volatile as the high cost EP programs in these regions are generally undertaken by major oil companies, consortiums and national oil companies as part of a longer term strategic development plan. Although 48 percent of the Companys consolidated revenues were generated in North America during 2009, Smiths profitability was influenced by business levels in markets outside of North America. The Distribution segment, which accounts for 22 percent of consolidated revenues and primarily supports a North American customer base, masks the geographic revenue mix of the Companys oilfield operations. Excluding the impact of the Distribution segment, approximately 65 percent of the Companys revenues were generated in markets outside of North America during 2009. Finally, a number of factors have driven an increase in the importance of national oil companies (NOCs) in the global energy industry. NOCs currently control a substantial portion of world oil reserves and production. As we look forward, NOCs and their governments will likely have more control over the pace and the manner in which oil and gas resources are developed, which could have implications for Smith and other oilfield service industry participants. We believe we have been successful in developing strong business relationships with NOCs, which contribute a sizable portion of our revenues. Business Outlook The Companys 2009 results were influenced by a material reduction in average worldwide drilling activity attributable to the significant slowdown experienced in the global economy. The impact of lower activity levels was partially offset by the large proportion of our oilfield business based in markets outside North America, areas that tend to be more stable from an oil and natural gas investment standpoint, and the various cost reduction measures undertaken by management to right size global operations. The majority of the rig count decline was experienced in the United States where drilling activity was 44 percent below the average level reported in 2008. The decrease in U.S. drilling activity is primarily attributable to the lower number of land based and shallow depth offshore programs, which are generally more sensitive to commodity prices. Customer spending in most international and deepwater drilling markets, which are primarily driven by oil directed activities, have been impacted to a lesser extent. Near term drilling activity will largely be influenced by natural gas fundamentals in the U.S. market and oil targeted drilling projects outside of North America. On a worldwide basis, drilling activity in 2010 is currently expected to increase moderately over 2009 levels, influenced by continued low global energy demand and U.S. natural gas storage levels. Although additional deterioration in the global economic environment could lead to lower exploration and production spending, further reducing demand for the Companys products and services and adversely impacting future results, the long term outlook for the energy sector is favorable due to supply and demand fundamentals. Our Merger Agreement with Schlumberger contains a number of restrictions on our operations during the pendency of the Merger. Our ability to implement our business plan and respond to market conditions will be subject to compliance with these obligations. Further information on these obligations can be found in the Merger Agreement and in the proxy statement/prospectus to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Results of Operations Segment Discussion Our business is segregated into three operating segments, M I SWACO, Smith Oilfield and Distribution, which is the basis upon which we report our results. The M I SWACO segment consists of a majority owned drilling fluid and environmental services joint venture operation. The Smith Oilfield segment is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and completion services operations, which includes drill bits, directional drilling services and downhole tools. The 16 Table of Contents Distribution segment consists of the Wilson distribution operations and a majority owned interest in CE Franklin Ltd., a publicly traded Canadian distribution company. Finally, general corporate primarily reflects expenses related to corporate personnel, administrative support functions and long term incentive compensation programs.

M I SWACO Segment Revenues M I SWACO primarily provides drilling and completion fluid systems and engineering and technical services to the oil and gas industry. Additionally, these operations provide oilfield production chemicals and manufacture and market equipment and services used for solids control, particle separation, pressure control, rig instrumentation and waste management. M I SWACO is significantly influenced by its exposure to the global offshore market, which constitutes approximately 50 percent of the segments revenue base, and to exploration and production spending for land based projects outside of North America, which contributes approximately 35 percent of the segments revenue base. Offshore drilling programs, which accounted for 16 percent of the worldwide rig count in 2009, are generally more revenue intensive than land based projects due to the complex nature of the related drilling environment. M I SWACOs revenues totaled $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, 19 percent below the level reported in the 2008 period. The year over year revenue decline was concentrated in the United States and the Europe/Africa region. The reduction in U.S. revenue levels was driven primarily by a decline in investment by exploration and production companies in land based drilling projects and, to a lesser extent, reduced activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico. Revenues within the segments Europe/Africa operations were influenced primarily by lower land based drilling in Russia and reduced shallow water drilling programs in the North Sea and Caspian markets. For the year ended December 31, 2008, M I SWACO reported revenues of $5.2 billion, an increase of 17 percent over the amounts reported in the 2007 fiscal year. Approximately two thirds of the revenue improvement was attributable to growth in Eastern Hemisphere markets. The increase largely reflects a 27 percent increase in onshore business volumes, influenced by increased customer activity in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) region, and higher offshore spending in West Africa and the North Sea markets. Western Hemisphere revenues grew 15 percent above the prior year level due to the impact of new land based contract awards in Mexico and higher customer spending associated with unconventional U.S. land based drilling projects. Operating Income Operating income for the M I SWACO segment was $516.4 million, or 12.2 percent of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating margins declined 4.0 percentage points from 2008 levels, reflecting the impact of lower business volumes and the loss of a higher proportion of environmental waste management and other 18 Table of Contents service based offerings, which generate better overall margins. Operating income decreased $323.3 million from the prior year, influenced by the sharp reduction in business activity, product mix factors and $25.1 million of cost associated with employee severance and other cost control measures. For the year ended December 31, 2008, M I SWACOs operating income totaled $839.6 million, or 16.2 percent of revenues. Operating income increased $110.2 million over the prior year; however, as a percentage of revenue, margins were 30 basis points below the comparable prior year period. Several factors contributed to the operating margin performance, including the impact of a shift in business mix towards lower relative margin, land based programs which resulted in a lower proportion of premium drilling fluid revenues. Smith Oilfield Segment Revenues The Smith Oilfield segment provides three cone and diamond drill bits, tubulars, borehole enlargement tools, drill motors, directional drilling, measurement while drilling, and logging while drilling services, as well as completions, coiled tubing, cased hole wireline and drilling related products and services. The Smith Oilfield segment has a high level of North American exposure with 57 percent of revenues concentrated in those markets, driven in part, by the significance of increased unconventional drilling projects in the U.S. land based market and the complexity of drilling programs, which drive demand for a wider range of product offerings. Smith Oilfield revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2.2 billion, down 22 percent from the 2008 level. The revenue comparison is influenced by the addition of the W H operations in August 2008, which partially offset the impact of the reported 43 percent decline in North American drilling activity. Excluding the impact of the retained W H operations, Smith Oilfield revenues declined 35 percent from the prior year, attributable primarily to lower demand for drill bits and other drilling related products and services, tubulars, and fishing and remedial services within the U.S. customer base. Increased competitive pricing pressures within the U.S. market as well as reduced customer activity in the FSU and the North Sea also contributed to the year on year decline. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Smith Oilfield revenues totaled $2.8 billion, a 29 percent improvement over the comparable prior year period. The majority of the year on year revenue growth related to the addition of the W H operations in August 2008. Excluding the impact of the acquired operations, Smith Oilfield revenues grew six percent above the prior year level influenced by strong demand for drill bit products in key geographic markets, including the United States, Brazil and the FSU region. Operating Income Operating income for the Smith Oilfield segment was $229.1 million, or 10.3 percent of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The segments operating margins were 15.9 percentage points below the prior year level. The margin decline is primarily attributable to changes in the business mix, the impact of increased competitive pricing pressure in the U.S. market and $25.4 million of charges incurred in connection with cost reduction measures. Inclusion for a full year of the acquired W H product and service lines, which contribute lower relative margins, coupled with the loss of high margin drill bit and premium tubular sales as well as high fixed cost service revenues influenced the reported business mix. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Smith Oilfields operating income totaled $746.8 million, or 26.2 percent of revenues. The segment operating margins were 1.8 percentage points below the prior year level, reflecting incremental operating margins of 20 percent. The addition of W Hs operations, which carry lower margins on a comparative basis accounted for the margin decline. Distribution Segment Revenues The Distribution segment markets pipe, valves, fittings and mill, safety and other maintenance products to energy and industrial markets, primarily through an extensive network of supply branches in the United States and Canada. The segment has the most significant North American revenue exposure of any of the Companys operations with 95 percent of fiscal 2009 revenues generated in those markets. Moreover, approximately one quarter of the segments revenues relate to sales in the downstream energy sector, including petrochemical plants and refineries, whose spending is largely influenced by the general state of the U.S. economic environment. 19 Table of Contents Additionally, certain customers in this sector utilize petroleum products as a base material and, accordingly, are impacted by crude oil and natural gas prices. The Distribution segment generated revenues of $1.8 billion, a decline of 35 percent from the preceding year. Over 80 percent of the revenue decline was reported in the segments U.S. operations, where the reduction in drilling activity levels impacted completion services, resulting in reduced customer spending for maintenance, repair and operating supplies in the energy and industrial sector operations. The revenue decline also reflects lower demand and market pricing for line pipe products, which accounted for approximately one third of the year over year decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Distribution segment reported revenues of $2.7 billion, 29 percent above the 2007 fiscal year. The majority of the revenue growth was attributable to increased demand for line pipe and other operating supplies associated with unconventional onshore drilling projects and pipeline expansion projects in the United States. Operating Income The Distribution segment reported an operating loss of $33.9 million in fiscal 2009. Distribution operating margins deteriorated 8.5 percentage points, influenced by the year over year decline in business volumes and lower product pricing. On an absolute dollar basis, reported operating results declined $214.1 million from the prior year period, driven by the impact of lower revenue levels and pricing, partially offset by a reduction in variable based operating expenditures. Operating income for the Distribution segment in fiscal 2008 was $180.2 million, or 6.6 percent of revenues. Segment operating margins improved 2.0 percentage points from 2007, reflecting improved business volumes and product pricing related to line pipe expansion projects in the energy sector. On an absolute dollar basis, operating income was $83.0 million above the prior year period reflecting higher revenue volumes and improved gross profit levels, partially offset by growth in operating expenses to support the expanded business base. Consolidated Discussion For the periods indicated, the following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations of the Company and presents these results as a percentage of total revenues (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Amount % Amount % Amount % Revenues $ 8,218,559 100 $ 10,770,838 100 $ 8,764,330 100 Gross profit 2,250,080 27 3,428,916 32 2,855,657 33 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,650,997 20 1,786,504 17 1,485,860 17 Operating income 599,083 7 1,642,412 15 1,369,797 16 Interest expense 150,277 1 89,765 1 69,990 1 Interest income (2,510 ) (3,374 ) (4,068 ) Income before income taxes 451,316 6 1,556,021 14 1,303,875 15 Income tax provision 139,105 2 505,892 4 408,471 5 Noncontrolling interests in net income of subsidiaries 163,742 2 282,845 3 248,353 3 Net income attributable to Smith $ 148,469 2 $ 767,284 7 $ 647,051 7 2009 versus 2008 Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $8.2 billion, 24 percent below the level reported in 2008 or 27 percent lower after excluding revenues from the retained W H operations acquired in August of 2008. The majority of the decline related to a 33 percent reduction in North American business volumes driven by a substantial slowdown in land based drilling and completion activity, reduced shallow water drilling programs in the Gulf of Mexico and increased competitive pricing pressure in the U.S. market. Revenues outside North America 20 Table of Contents declined 12 percent period to period primarily associated with the reduced number of offshore programs in the North Sea market as well as lower exploration and production spending in the Former Soviet Union. Gross profit declined 34 percent from 2008 to $2.3 billion in 2009. Gross profit margins declined 4.4 percentage points from the 2008 level, influenced by the sharp decline in market activity together with increased pricing pressures within the U.S. market. Changes in the relative business mix also influenced the year over year margin decline. On an absolute dollar basis, gross profit decreased $1.2 billion from the prior year, driven by the significant reduction in business volumes as well as pricing deterioration experienced in a number of the Companys U.S. product and service offerings. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $1.7 billion, an eight percent decrease from the amounts reported in the prior fiscal year. After excluding $60.8 million in charges associated primarily with personnel reductions and other cost control activities, operating expenses declined $196.3 million from 2008. The decline in variable based expenses, resulting from the reduction in activity levels and personnel reductions, was partially offset by incremental costs associated with the W H operations. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 3.5 percentage points reflecting the impact of the significant decline in revenues on fixed cost coverage across sales and administrative functions. Net interest expense, which represents interest expense less interest income, equaled $147.8 million for the 2009 fiscal year. The year over year reported growth in net interest expense of $61.4 million is attributable to higher interest rates associated with the refinancing of short term indebtedness with a fixed rate debt issuance during the first quarter of 2009 and to a lesser extent an approximate 50 percent increase in average borrowings outstanding. Income tax provision totaled $139.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.8 percent. The Companys effective rate decreased 1.7 percentage points from the 2008 level reflecting a shift in pre tax earnings towards the M I SWACO operations which, due to the partnership structure in the United States, reports a lower effective rate. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate due to the impact of M I SWACOs U.S. partnership earnings for which the noncontrolling partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes. The Company properly consolidates the pretax income related to the noncontrolling partners share of U.S. partnership earnings but excludes the related income tax provision. Noncontrolling interest in net income of subsidiaries reflects the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the noncontrolling interest partners. Noncontrolling interest expense totaled $163.7 million in 2009, a $119.1 million decrease from the amount reported in the prior year period, primarily associated with lower profitability levels in the M I SWACO joint venture. 2008 versus 2007 Consolidated revenues totaled $10.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a 23 percent increase over amounts reported in the prior year. Excluding the impact of incremental revenues associated with the W H transaction, base business levels increased 17 percent over the prior year period. The base business improvement primarily reflects higher drilling and completion fluid volumes to support the eight percent growth in global land based drilling activity and, to a lesser extent, increased demand for line pipe and other operating supplies associated with unconventional onshore drilling projects and pipeline expansion projects in the United States. Gross profit increased to $3.4 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, reflecting a 20 percent improvement over the prior years results. Gross profit margins declined approximately 80 basis points as compared to the 2007 fiscal year influenced, in part, by the lower proportion of offshore revenues which impacted sales volumes of premium drilling fluids. On an absolute dollar basis, gross profit increased $573.3 million over the prior year impacted by growth in overall business volumes and, to a lesser extent, incremental profitability associated with the acquired W H business operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $1.8 billion, a 20 percent increase over the amounts reported in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses declined approximately 40 basis points reflecting improved fixed cost coverage across sales and administrative functions. Higher variable related costs associated with the expansion in base business volumes and, to a lesser extent, operating expenses attributable to the acquired W H business operations contributed to the reported expense growth. 21 Table of Contents Net interest expense, which represents interest expense less interest income, equaled $86.4 million for the 2008 fiscal year. The $20.5 million year over year reported increase in interest reflects borrowings required to fund the W H acquisition and, to a lesser extent, increased working capital investment. The impact of the higher incremental borrowings on interest expense was partially offset by the substantial decline in short term Eurodollar interest rates experienced during fiscal 2008. Income tax provision totaled $505.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, reflecting an effective tax rate of 32.5 percent. Excluding the impact of non recurring tax benefits recognized during the prior fiscal year, the Companys effective rate increased approximately 60 basis points. Net of non recurring items, the increase was influenced by the W H acquisition which resulted in a modest shift in the geographic mix of earnings towards a higher relative rate tax jurisdiction. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate due to the impact of M I SWACOs U.S. partnership earnings for which the noncontrolling partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes. Noncontrolling interest in net income of subsidiaries reflects the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the noncontrolling interest partners. Noncontrolling interest expense totaled $282.8 million in 2008, a $34.5 million increase above the amount reported in the prior year period, primarily associated with improved profitability levels in the M I SWACO joint venture. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents increased $825.8 million during the year and equaled $988.3 million as of December 31, 2009. The Company generated $1.3 billion of cash flows from operations during 2009 which is an increase of $636.0 million from the amount provided in 2008. The year over year growth in cash flows from operations reflects the impact of substantial declines in working capital in response to the reduction in activity levels, and was partially offset by the reduction in profitability levels. The Company used $277.5 million of the net cash provided by operations to fund investing activities. During 2009, the Company invested $294.1 million in property, plant and equipment, after considering proceeds from disposals, to support the geographic expansion of directional drilling and other operations outside North America and to maintain the existing capital base. The sale of certain non core operations during early 2009 generated cash proceeds of $72.7 million which exceeded payments made to fund acquisitions in 2009. Capital expenditures, after deducting proceeds from sales, are expected to total $320 million in 2010, approximately ten percent above the spending levels reported for 2009. The projected 2010 spending level reflects continued investment in geographic expansion, subject to the obligations under the Merger Agreement, as well as an expected modest recovery in North American drilling activity. The Company completed a number of financing transactions during 2009 to recast scheduled maturities of debt, to provide additional liquidity for working capital requirements, and to allow for potential investments in acquisition candidates. In this regard, the Company completed a public offering of $300.0 million five year and $700.0 million ten year Senior Notes under an existing Indenture in March 2009. Net proceeds of $991.1 million were received in connection with the debt offering and were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under a $1.0 billion bridge loan facility, which was scheduled to expire in August 2009. Additionally, in November 2009, the Company completed a public offering of 28 million shares of common stock at $26.50 per share. Net cash proceeds to the Company after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other related expenses were $717.4 million. During 2009, cash flows used in financing activities totaled $201.8 million. After excluding net proceeds from the offering of common stock, which remained in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2009, cash flows used in financing activities were $919.2 million, including debt repayments of $638.0 million, payment of $105.2 million in common stock dividends and distributions of $106.0 million to a noncontrolling interest joint venture partner. The Companys primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations. Cash flow generated from operations is primarily influenced by the level of worldwide drilling activity, which affects profitability levels and working capital requirements. Capacity under revolving credit agreements is also available, 22 Table of Contents if necessary, to fund operating or investing activities. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company negotiated a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions and terminated its existing $400.0 million revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no amounts drawn or letters of credit issued under various U.S. revolving credit facilities, resulting in $1.4 billion of current capacity available for operating or investing needs. The Company also has revolving credit facilities in place outside of the United States, which are generally used to finance local operating needs. At the end of fiscal 2009, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $156.7 million under the non U.S. borrowing facilities. The Companys external sources of liquidity include debt and equity financing in the public capital markets, if needed. The Company carries an investment grade credit rating with recognized rating agencies, generally providing the Company with access to debt markets. The Companys overall borrowing capacity is, in part, dependent on maintaining compliance with financial covenants under the various credit agreements and is subject to the obligations under the Merger Agreement. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was within the covenant compliance thresholds under its various loan indentures, as amended, providing the ability to access available borrowing capacity. Management believes internally generated cash flow combined with capacity available under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to finance capital expenditures and working capital needs of the existing operations for the foreseeable future. Management continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire products and businesses complementary to the Companys operations, subject to the obligations under the Merger Agreement. In addition to potential external acquisition candidates, we and our M I SWACO joint venture partner, Schlumberger, can offer to sell to the other party its entire ownership interest in the joint venture in exchange for a cash purchase price specified by the offering partner. If the initiating partners offer to sell is not accepted, such party is obligated to purchase the other partys interest at the same valuation per interest. If we agree to purchase Schlumbergers joint venture interest, whether pursuant to these provisions or otherwise, we would need to fund the transaction. Our funding could include issuing equity, resulting in dilution to our existing stockholders, obtaining additional debt, which may require waivers of applicable debt covenants, or obtaining other financing, as well as using available cash to fund the purchase. This financing and or use of cash could impact our ability to fund working capital requirements, make capital expenditures and investments or fund other general corporate requirements, and could limit our ability to make future acquisitions. Should we instead not purchase Schlumbergers interest, we would no longer have an interest in the joint venture. On February 21, 2010, we and Schlumberger entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger will merge with and into us and we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger. The Company makes regular quarterly distributions under a dividend program. The current annual payout under the program of approximately $120 million is expected to be funded with future cash flows from operations and, if necessary, amounts available under existing credit facilities. The level of future dividend payments will be at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors, subject to the obligations under the Merger Agreement, which permit regular quarterly dividends in an amount up to $0.12 per share, and will depend upon the Companys financial condition, earnings, cash flows, compliance with certain debt covenants and other relevant factors. The Companys Board of Directors maintains a share repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Companys common stock, subject to regulatory issues, market considerations and other relevant factors. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 15.2 million shares remaining under the current authorization. Future repurchases under the program may be executed from time to time, subject to the obligations under the Merger Agreement, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and will be funded with cash flows from operations or amounts available under existing credit facilities. The Company believes it has sufficient existing manufacturing capacity to meet current demand for its products and services. Additionally, inflation has historically had only a moderate impact on the Companys financial results. During 2008, the Company experienced escalation in transportation costs, steel, petrochemical and other commodity prices due to high crude oil and natural gas prices. While these costs declined in 2009 from 2008 average levels, inventory purchased during 2008 and sold during 2009 influenced the Companys reported results during 2009, particularly within the Distribution segment. Based on the current global economic outlook, 23 Table of Contents management believes wages and other costs that impact our businesses should be relatively stable for the foreseeable future. The Company has not engaged in off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities, and the consolidation of the Companys noncontrolling ownership positions would not result in an increase in reported leverage ratios. The Company has no contractual arrangements in place that could result in the issuance of additional shares of the Companys common stock at a future date other than the Companys stock based compensation program, which is discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 15, Long Term Incentive Compensation. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys debt maturities, estimated interest on fixed rate long term debt and future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases having initial terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Debt maturities $ 2,173,022 $ 358,768 $ 540,341 $ 299,360 $ 974,553 Interest on fixed rate long term debt 894,337 125,475 228,675 208,312 331,875 Operating lease commitments 373,065 90,334 104,598 60,101 118,032 Total $ 3,440,424 $ 574,577 $ 873,614 $ 567,773 $ 1,424,460 Amounts related to commitments under capital lease agreements, purchase obligations and other long term liabilities reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, including pension and other postretirement obligations, have been excluded from the above table due to immateriality. Moreover, the required disclosure related to the Companys $69.3 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions has been omitted from the above table. Due to the complex application of tax regulations, combined with our inability to predict when tax audits in various jurisdictions may be concluded, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements, if any, related to its uncertain tax positions. Standby Letters of Credit In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, the Company is contingently liable for performance under standby letters of credit and bid, performance and surety bonds. Certain of these outstanding instruments guarantee payment to insurance companies which reinsure certain liability coverages of the Companys insurance captive. Excluding the impact of these instruments, for which $18 million of related liabilities are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, the Company was contingently liable for approximately $254 million of standby letters of credit and bid, performance and surety bonds at December 31, 2009. Management does not expect any material amounts to be drawn on these instruments. Insurance The Company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations. The Company has elected to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under its insurance programs. Amounts in excess of the self insured retention levels are fully insured to limits believed appropriate for the Companys operations. Self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported. While management believes that amounts accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are adequate for expected liabilities arising from the Companys portion of losses, estimates of these liabilities may change as circumstances develop. 24 Table of Contents Litigation The Company is a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subsequent to the announcement of the proposed combination of the Company and Schlumberger and through February 25, 2010, four putative class action lawsuits were commenced on behalf of stockholders of the Company against the Company and its directors in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, challenging the proposed transaction. One of the lawsuits also names Schlumberger and one of its affiliates as defendants. The lawsuits variously allege that the Companys directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, causing Smith to enter into the proposed transaction at an allegedly inadequate and unfair price and agreeing to transaction terms that improperly inhibit alternative transactions. One of the lawsuits separately alleges that the Company aided and abetted the directors breaches of fiduciary duties, and another of the lawsuits alleges that Schlumberger aided and abetted the directors breaches of fiduciary duties. The various complaints seek, among other things, an injunction barring defendants from consummating the proposed transaction, declaratory relief and attorneys fees. The Company believes that the lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously. Environmental The Company routinely establishes and reviews the adequacy of reserves for estimated future environmental clean up costs for properties currently or previously operated by the Company. In the opinion of management, these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business. Management regularly reviews outstanding receivables and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established reserves, management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of these parties change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. Inventory Reserves. The Company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers around the world. On a routine basis, the Company uses judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market. Managements estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations, market fundamentals and the physical condition of products. Changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets. The Company has made a number of business acquisitions which has resulted in the recording of a material amount of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company is required to perform an annual impairment evaluation for these assets, which is largely influenced by future cash flow projections. Estimating future cash flows of the Companys operations requires management to make judgments about future operating results and working capital requirements. Changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the 25 Table of Contents operations would influence the evaluation and may result in the determination that a portion of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is impaired when the annual analysis is performed. Self Insurance. The Company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations. The Company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs. Management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves. As claims develop and additional information becomes available, adjustments to loss reserves may be required. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the Company. In providing for deferred taxes, management considers current tax regulations, estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. In certain cases, management has established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. The Company recognizes tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions when, based on technical merits, it is more likely than not the respective positions will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. Adjustments to the recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions may be required pursuant to the ultimate settlement of an income tax audit, the refinement of an estimate in light of changes to any facts or circumstances, or the expiration of a statute of limitations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting standards and applicable updates are issued that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. During 2009, the Company adopted an update to existing accounting guidance which revised the accounting and disclosure requirements for acquisition transactions. The revised standard differs from the previous standard in that it requires the Company to expense professional fees and other transaction related costs as incurred instead of capitalizing these costs as purchase price consideration. Additionally, the Company is required to estimate contingent assets, liabilities and transaction related consideration as of the purchase date with future changes in the underlying estimates recognized in the statement of operations. Finally, the Company is also required to reflect any adjustments to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties associated with acquisitions as income tax expense rather than an adjustment to goodwill. During 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of a new accounting standard which modified the accounting and disclosure requirements for subsidiaries which are not wholly owned. In accordance with the provisions of the new accounting standard, the Company has reclassified the noncontrolling interest previously reflected as a long term liability and included the amount as a component of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company has presented the net income attributable to the Company and the noncontrolling ownership interests separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of a new accounting standard which requires enhanced disclosure about derivative instruments. The standard requires the inclusion of tabular information reflecting the impact of derivative financial instruments on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted a new accounting standard which amends previous guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE). The standard modifies how an enterprise determines the primary beneficiary that would consolidate the VIE from a quantitative risks and rewards calculation to a qualitative approach. Such assessment is required to be performed on a continuous basis and is influenced by, among other things, an enterprises ability to direct the most significant activities that influence the VIEs operating performance. 26 Table of Contents The Company does not expect the adoption of this accounting standard to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to existing guidance with respect to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables. This update will allow allocation of consideration received for qualified separate deliverables based on estimated selling prices for both delivered and undelivered items when vendor specific or third party evidence is not available. Additionally, disclosure of the nature of multiple element arrangements, the general timing of their delivery, and significant factors and estimates used to determine estimated selling prices are required. The Company is currently evaluating this update, which will be adopted for new revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning January 1, 2011. Management believes the impact of other recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk primarily associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of hedging instruments. The Companys exposure to interest rate changes is managed and will be managed, subject to the obligations under the Merger Agreement, through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and by entering into interest rate contracts, from time to time, on a portion of its long term borrowings. At December 31, 2009, the Company had one interest rate contract outstanding with a notional amount of $63.9 million, which converts the underlying floating interest rate debt to a fixed rate of 6.2 percent. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, 28 percent and 80 percent, respectively, of the Companys total debt carried a variable interest rate. Management believes that it will be able to manage its remaining exposure to variable rate debt instruments, if required, with interest rate contracts. Accordingly, significant interest rate changes are not expected to have a material near term impact on the Companys future earnings or cash flows. The Companys exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is managed and will be managed, subject to the obligations under the Merger Agreement, primarily through the use of forward exchange contracts. These contracts increase or decrease in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currencies. All currency contracts are components of the Companys hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. The terms of these contracts generally do not exceed two years. As of December 31, 2009, the notional amounts of fair value hedge contracts outstanding totaled $114.5 million and the fair value was less than the notional amount of these contracts by $1.7 million. There were no foreign exchange cash flow hedge contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the notional amount of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were $235.5 million and $13.2 million, respectively, and the fair value was less than the notional amount of these contracts by $10.8 million. In some areas, where hedging is not cost effective, the Company addresses foreign currency exposure utilizing working capital management. 27 Table of Contents
