ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The Companys revenues are based on specific contracts with its clients. Such contracts generally specify: (a) time periods covered by the audit; (b) nature and extent of audit services to be provided by the Company; (c) the clients duties in assisting and cooperating with the Company; and (d) fees payable to the Company, generally expressed as a specified percentage of the amounts recovered by the client resulting from overpayment claims identified. Clients generally recover claims by either taking credits against outstanding payables or future purchases from the involved vendors, or receiving refund checks directly from those vendors. The manner in which a claim is recovered by a client is often dictated by industry practice. In addition, many clients establish client specific procedural guidelines that the Company must satisfy prior to submitting claims for client approval. For some services provided by the Company, client contracts provide for compensation to the Company in the form of a flat fee, or fee rate per hour, or per unit of usage for the rendering of that service. The Company generally recognizes revenue on the accrual basis except with respect to its Meridian VAT reclaim business and certain international Accounts Payable Services units where revenue is recognized on the cash basis in accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. Revenue is generally recognized for a contractually specified percentage of amounts recovered when it has been determined that the client has received economic value (generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors), and when the following criteria are met: (a) persuasive evidence of an existing contractual arrangement between the Company and the client exists; (b) services have been rendered; (c) the fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable; and (d) collectability is reasonably assured. In certain limited circumstances, the Company will invoice a client prior to meeting all four of these criteria. In those instances, revenue is deferred until all of the criteria are met. Historically, there has been a certain amount of revenue that, even though meeting the requirements of the Companys revenue recognition policy, relates to underlying claims ultimately rejected by the Companys clients vendors. In that case, the Companys clients may request a refund of such amount. The Company records such refunds as a reduction of revenue (See Critical Accounting Policies Unbilled Revenue and Refund Liability as fully described in Note 1 of Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K). The contingent fee based VAT reclaim division of the Companys Meridian business, along with certain other international Accounts Payable Services units, recognize revenue on the cash basis in accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. Based on the guidance in SAB No. 104, Meridian defers recognition of contingent fee revenues to the accounting period in which cash is both received from the foreign governmental agencies reimbursing the VAT claims and transferred to Meridians clients. The Company derives a relatively small amount of revenues on a fee for service basis where revenue is based upon a flat fee, or fee per hour, or fee per unit of usage. The Company recognizes revenue for these types of services as they are provided and invoiced and when the revenue recognition criteria described above in clauses (a) through (d) have been satisfied. On March 29, 2005, the Company announced that CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare program, awarded the Company a contract to provide recovery audit services for the State of Californias Medicare spending. The three year contract was effective on March 28, 2005. To fully address the range of payment recovery opportunities, the Company has sub contracted with Concentra Preferred Systems, the nations largest provider of specialized cost containment services for the healthcare industry, which will add its clinical experience to the Companys expertise in recovery audit services. The contract was awarded as part of a demonstration program by CMS to recover overpayments through the use of recovery auditing. The Company began to incur capital expenditures and employee compensation costs related to this contract in 2005. Such capital expenditures and employee compensation costs will continue to be incurred during 2007 as the Company continues to build this business. Management remains optimistic that the audit of Medicare payments in California will make an important contribution to future earnings; however, the Company has only limited ability to influence the timing of the processing of identified claims by third party claims processors, and the Companys revenues from its Medicare audit efforts may vary significantly from period to period. 23 Table of Contents In late 2006, legislation was passed that mandated that recovery audit of Medicare be extended beyond March 27, 2008, the end of the three year recovery audit demonstration project under the original authorizing legislation, and that CMS enter into additional contracts with recovery audit contractors to expand recovery auditing of Medicare out to all fifty states by January 1, 2010. While it is difficult to assess the impact of this legislation, management believes it will provide additional opportunities to expand the Companys Medicare audit recovery business. Operational Restructuring On August 19, 2005, the Company announced that it had taken the initial step in implementing an expense restructuring plan, necessitated by the Companys declining revenue trend over the previous two and one half years. On September 30, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the restructuring plan and authorized implementation of the plan. At the time the operational restructuring plan was approved, annualized savings from the restructuring plan were expected to be approximately $42.2 million. Management believes that as of December 31, 2006, cost savings in excess of the original estimate have been achieved. The expense restructuring plan encompassed exit activities, including reducing the number of clients served, reducing the number of countries in which the Company operates, reducing headcount, and terminating operating leases. Almost all of the savings were realized in the area of selling, general and administrative expenses and only a small percentage of the Companys auditor staff was directly impacted by the reductions. See Operational Restructuring Expense for more details regarding the operational restructuring. Financial Restructuring On October 19, 2005 the Board of Directors of the Company formed a Special Restructuring Committee to oversee the efforts of the Company, with the assistance of its financial advisor, Rothschild, Inc., to restructure the Companys financial obligations, including its obligations under its then existing convertible subordinated notes, and to improve the Companys liquidity. The restructuring was successfully completed on March 17, 2006. Pursuant to the restructuring, the Company exchanged for $124.1 million of its existing convertible subordinated notes due November 2006 (and $1.8 million of accrued interest thereon) the following new securities: $51.5 million of new senior notes, $59.6 million of new senior convertible notes that may be converted into shares of common stock, and new Series A convertible preferred stock having an initial liquidation preference of $14.9 million. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock had a liquidation preference of $11.2 million. Concurrently with closing the exchange offer, the Company also refinanced its senior indebtedness. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Restructuring for more details regarding the financial restructuting. Critical Accounting Policies Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a discussion of the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K. However, certain of the Companys accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of its financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Accounting policies that involve the use of estimates that meet both of the following criteria are considered by management to be critical accounting policies. First, the accounting estimate requires the Company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate is made. Second, alternate estimates in the current period, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely in future periods, would have a material impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. 24 Table of Contents In addition to estimates that meet the critical estimate criteria, the Company also makes many other accounting estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, refund liabilities, accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, information available prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This information forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including changes in those estimates not deemed critical. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, involve its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The development and selection of accounting estimates, including those deemed critical, and the associated disclosures in this Form 10 K have been discussed with the audit committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue on the accrual basis except with respect to its Meridian VAT reclaim business, and certain international Accounts Payable Services units where revenue is recognized on the cash basis in accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. Revenue is generally recognized for a contractually specified percentage of amounts recovered when it has been determined that our clients have received economic value (generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors), and when the following criteria are met: (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (b) services have been rendered; (c) the fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable; and (d) collectibility is reasonably assured. The determination that each of the aforementioned criteria has been met, particularly the determination of the timing of economic benefit received by the client and the determination that collectibility is reasonably assured, requires the application of significant judgment by management and a misapplication of this judgment could result in inappropriate recognition of revenue. Unbilled Receivables Refund Liabilities. Unbilled receivables are usually contractual and relate to claims for which our client has received economic value. Unbilled receivables arise when a portion of the Companys fee is deferred at the time of the initial invoice. At a later date (which can be up to a year after original invoice, or a year after completion of the audit period), the unbilled receivable amount is invoiced. Notwithstanding the deferred due date, the Company and the client acknowledge that this unbilled receivable has been earned at the time of the original invoice, it just has a deferred due date. Refund liabilities result from reductions in the economic value previously received by the Companys clients with respect to vendor claims identified by the Company and for which the Company has previously recognized revenue. Such refund liabilities are recognized by either offsets to amounts otherwise due from clients or by cash refunds to clients. The Company computes the estimate of its refund liabilities at any given time based on actual historical refund data. A hypothetical 1% change in refund liabilities would have an impact on operating income of approximately $0.1 million. Periodic changes in unbilled receivables and refund liabilities are recorded as adjustments to revenue. Accounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of its clients to make required payments. The Company evaluates the adequacy of these allowances on a periodic basis. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to, historical loss experience, the aging of current accounts receivable balances and provisions for adverse situations that may affect a clients ability to pay. If the evaluation of allowance requirements differs from the actual aggregate allowance, adjustments are made to the allowance. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available. If the financial condition of any of the Companys clients were to deteriorate, or their operating climates were to change, resulting in an impairment of either their ability or 25 Table of Contents willingness to make payments, additional allowances may be required. If the Companys estimate of required allowances for doubtful accounts is determined to be insufficient, it could result in decreased operating income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if a client subsequently remits cash for an accounts receivable balance which has previously been written off, it could result in increased operating income in the period in which the payment is received. A hypothetical 1% change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would have an impact on operating income of less than $0.1 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company, working with its independent valuation advisors, Adams Capital, LLC, completed the required annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142. As a result of this testing, the Company concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of 2005, as part of its annual intangible asset impairment testing, the Company, together with its independent valuation advisors, Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP, performed valuation analyses of its goodwill balances as well as other intangible assets. As a result of this process, the Company determined that non cash, pre tax intangible asset impairment charges totaling $170.4 million were required during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys Accounts Payable Services segment had experienced its third consecutive year of significant declines in revenues and gross profit. The continuing downward trend in this segment was the single most important factor leading to the necessity of the impairment charge. This trend is also what necessitated the initiation of the implementation of the Companys operational restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2005. Income Taxes. The Companys reported effective tax rates on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations approximated (11.1)%, (0.4)%, and 12,114% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The unusual 2005 rate is primarily attributable to the nondeductible portions of the impairment charges discussed above and the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The unusual 2006 and 2004 rates are primarily attributable to the changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Companys effective tax rate is based on historical and anticipated future taxable income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the Companys tax positions. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the Companys effective tax rate reflected in its Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K is different than that reported in its tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the Companys tax returns, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the Companys tax returns in future years for which it has already recorded the tax benefit in the statement of operations. The Company establishes valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that it believes are more likely than not to be realized. These valuation allowances are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has already been taken on the Companys tax returns but has not yet been recognized as an expense in its consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets, including the Companys past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the length of carry back and carry forward periods, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses in 26 Table of Contents recent years are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. In 2004, the Company recognized an increase in the valuation allowance against its remaining net deferred tax assets of $76.6 million. This increase was offset by the use of approximately $4.3 million of capital loss carry forwards resulting in a net change in the valuation allowance of approximately $72.3 million. During 2005 the Company recorded an additional valuation allowance adjustment of $48.5 million, bringing the total valuation allowance balance to $139.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, management has determined that based on all available evidence, a valuation allowance of $79.5 million is appropriate, as compared to a valuation allowance in the amount of $139.6 million as of the year ended December 31, 2005. The reduction in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the write off of a number of deferred tax assets as a result of an ownership change as defined in IRC Section 382, and the corresponding limitations imposed on certain tax attributes as a result of this ownership change. The impact of IRC Section 382 on the deferred tax assets of the Company is discussed in more detail in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K. Stock Based Compensation. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) in 2006. See New Accounting Standards below. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Statements of Operations Data: Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues 72.8 66.8 61.9 Gross margin 27.2 33.2 38.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.6 38.1 35.5 Impairment charges 58.3 Operational restructuring expenses 1.6 4.0 Operating income (loss) 3.0 (67.2 ) 2.6 Interest expense, net (6.1 ) (2.9 ) (2.4 ) Loss on financial restructuring (3.8 ) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations (6.9 ) (70.1 ) 0.2 Income taxes 0.7 0.3 21.7 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before discontinued operations (7.6 ) (70.4 ) (21.5 ) Discontinued operations: Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations and disposals, net of income taxes (0.3 ) (0.7 ) 1.1 Net earnings (loss) (7.9 )% (71.1 )% (20.4 )% The Company has two reportable operating segments, the Accounts Payable Services segment and Meridian. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K. 27 Table of Contents Accounts Payable Services Revenues. Accounts Payable Services revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Domestic Accounts Payable Services revenue: Retail $ 126.9 $ 137.3 $ 167.8 Commercial 13.5 17.1 33.5 140.4 154.4 201.3 International Accounts Payable Services revenue 85.5 97.2 107.9 Total Accounts Payable Services revenue $ 225.9 $ 251.6 $ 309.2 For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company continued to experience a decline in revenues for domestic retail/wholesale Accounts Payable Services. The decline in revenues is consistent with the revenue decline that the Company has been experiencing over the past several years and was primarily attributable to fewer claims being processed as a result of improved client processes. Revenues from both domestic and international operations decreased as the Companys clients developed and strengthened their own internal audit capabilities as a substitute for the Companys services. Further, the Companys clients made fewer transaction errors as a result of the training and methodologies provided by the Company as part of the Companys accounts payable recovery process. These trends are expected to continue, and as a result, revenues from the Accounts Payable Services segment are expected to continue to decline for the foreseeable future. Revenues from the Companys domestic commercial Accounts Payable Services clients declined during 2006 and 2005, as well. The Company believes the market for providing disbursement audit services (which typically entail acquisition from the client of limited purchase data and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories) to commercial entities in the United States is declining with fewer audit starts and lower fee rates due to increasing pricing pressures. In response to the decline in performance for the commercial business, the Company continues to intentionally reduce the number of commercial clients serviced based on profitability, and this trend is expected to continue. As a result of the foregoing, revenues from domestic commercial Accounts Payable Services are expected to continue to decline for the foreseeable future. The declines in domestic retail, domestic commercial and international Accounts Payable Services revenues in 2005 versus 2004 are likewise attributable to the same factors as discussed above. The Company intends to maximize the revenue opportunities with each of its existing clients by identifying and auditing new categories of potential errors. The Company also intends to increase its emphasis on using its technology and professional experience to assist its clients in achieving objectives that do not directly involve recovery of past overpayments. These objectives are related to such things as transaction accuracy and compliance, purchasing effectiveness, MA due diligence analysis, and processing efficiency in the procure to pay value chain. In addition the Company will continue to focus on its business within the Health Care industry and in particular with the Medicare audit. In 2005, CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare program, awarded the Company a contract to provide recovery audit services for the State of Californias Medicare spending. The three year contract, effective March 28, 2005, was awarded as part of a demonstration program by CMS to recover overpayments on behalf of taxpayers through the use of recovery auditing. The Company began generating revenue from the California Medicare audit in 2006 and believes that Medicare audit has significant revenue and profit potential in future years. In late 2006, legislation was passed that mandated that recovery audit of Medicare be extended beyond March 27, 2008, the end of the three year recovery audit demonstration project under the original authorizing legislation, and that CMS enter into additional contracts with recovery audit contractors to expand recovery auditing of Medicare out to all fifty states by January 1, 2010. While it is difficult to assess the impact of this legislation, management believes it will provide additional opportunities to expand the Companys Medicare audit recovery business. Cost of Revenues (COR). COR consists principally of commissions paid or payable to the Companys auditors based primarily upon the level of overpayment recoveries, and compensation paid to various types of hourly workers and salaried operational managers. Also included in COR are other direct costs incurred by these personnel, 28 Table of Contents including rental of non headquarters offices, travel and entertainment, telephone, utilities, maintenance and supplies and clerical assistance. A significant portion of the components comprising COR for the Companys domestic Accounts Payable Services operations are variable compensation related costs that will increase or decrease with increases and decreases in revenues. The COR support base for domestic retail and domestic commercial operations are not separately distinguishable and are not evaluated by management individually. The Companys international Accounts Payable Services also have a portion of their COR, although less than domestic Accounts Payable Services, that will vary with revenues. The lower variability is due to the predominant use of salaried auditor compensation plans in most emerging market countries. Accounts Payable Services COR for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Domestic Accounts Payable Services COR $ 95.3 $ 99.8 $ 120.2 International Accounts Payable Services COR 66.6 68.1 72.7 Total Accounts Payable Services COR $ 161.9 $ 167.9 $ 192.9 The dollar decrease in COR for 2006 compared to 2005 and for 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to lower revenues during each fiscal year. COR for domestic Accounts Payable services was $95.3 million or 67.9% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. This amount includes $2.9 million of severance charges and $3.0 million of bonuses earned during the year. This compares to $99.8 million or 64.6% of revenue in 2005 and $120.2 million or 59.7% of revenue in 2004. In addition while the Companys revenues continued to decrease in 2006 and 2005, the Company continued to incur certain fixed costs that are also a component of COR. On a dollar basis, COR for the Companys international Accounts Payable Services decreased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to lower revenues. COR for international Accounts Payable Services was $66.6 million or 77.9% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. This amount includes $1.0 million of severance charges and $1.1 million of bonuses earned during the year. This compares to $68.1 million or 70.1% of revenue in 2005 and $72.7 million or 67.4% of revenue in 2004. Again, there is a portion of international Accounts Payable Services COR that is fixed expenses. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SGA). SGA expenses include the expenses of sales and marketing activities, information technology services and the corporate data center, human resources, legal, accounting, administration, currency translation, headquarters related depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangibles with finite lives. The SGA support base for domestic retail and domestic commercial operations are not separately distinguishable and are not evaluated by management individually. Accounts Payable Services SGA for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Domestic Accounts Payable Services SGA $ 20.7 $ 30.9 $ 39.3 International Accounts Payable Services SGA 10.2 28.5 29.4 Total Accounts Payable Services SGA $ 30.9 $ 59.4 $ 68.7 Accounts Payable Services SGA expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased by $28.5 million (or 48%) from the same period in 2005. Such expenses had already decreased in 2005 by $9.3 million (or 13.5%) from 2004. The reduction in both the domestic and international Accounts Payable Services SGA is primarily the result of reducing the number of clients served, reducing the number of countries in which the Company operates, reducing headcount, terminating operating leases, and diligently managing the operating expenses of the business. 29 Table of Contents Meridian Meridians operating income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 40.2 $ 40.6 $ 41.4 Cost of revenues 31.8 27.2 24.2 Gross margin 8.4 13.4 17.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3.7 6.6 8.2 Operational restructuring expense 0.4 Operating income $ 4.7 $ 6.4 $ 9.0 Revenues. Meridian recognizes revenue in its contingent fee based VAT reclaim operations on the cash basis in accordance with SAB No. 104. Based on the guidance in SAB No. 104, Meridian defers recognition of revenues to the accounting period in which cash is both received from the foreign governmental agencies reimbursing VAT claims and transferred to Meridians clients. Since Meridian has minimal influence over when the foreign governmental agencies make their respective VAT reimbursement payments, Meridians revenues can vary markedly from period to period. Revenue generated by Meridian decreased by $0.4 million in 2006 when compared to the same period in 2005. Fee income on VAT refunds decreased by $1.7 million in 2006 when compared to 2005 due to the timing of refunds from local VAT authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the exchange rate impact of the strengthening of the Euro, Meridians functional currency, relative to the U.S. dollar, resulted in the increase in revenue of $0.8 million when compared to the similar period of 2005. Meridian has developed a number of new business services offered on a fee for service basis, including accounts payable and employee expense processing for third parties, tax return processing for governmental departments, and Local Agent Services Division (LASD) opportunities. The revenues from these services totaled $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenues generated by Meridian decreased by $0.8 million in 2005 when compared to the same period in 2004. Fee income on VAT refunds decreased by $0.6 million in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to the timing of refunds from local VAT authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the exchange rate impact of the strengthening of the Euro, Meridians functional currency, relative to the U.S. dollar, resulted in the increase in revenue of $0.2 million when compared to the similar period of 2004. Cost of Revenue (COR). COR for Meridian consists principally of compensation paid to various types of hourly workers and salaried operational managers. Also included in COR are other direct costs incurred by these personnel, including rental of offices, travel and entertainment, telephone, utilities, maintenance and supplies and clerical assistance. COR for the Companys Meridian operations is largely fixed within a period and, for the most part, will not vary significantly with changes in revenue. In addition, revenue for Meridian is recognized on a cash rather than accrual basis. As a result, COR from period to period on a percentage basis, can vary in relation to revenue recognized during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the prior year, on a dollar basis, COR increased primarily due to increased payroll costs as a result of higher headcount and annual merit increases and increases in commissions paid to joint venture partners. The exchange rate impact of the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar was an increase in COR of $0.8 million when compared to the similar period of 2005. Without the exchange rate impact, COR increased by 2.6% for the year. For the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period of the prior year, on a dollar basis, COR for the Companys Meridian operations increased primarily due to increased payroll costs as a result of higher headcount related to new service offerings and an annual merit increase. 30 Table of Contents Selling, General Administrative Expenses (SGA). Meridians SGA expenses include the expenses of marketing activities, administration, professional services, property rentals and currency translation. Due to the relatively fixed nature of the Companys SGA expenses, these expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary markedly from period to period based on fluctuations in revenues. On a dollar basis, Meridians SGA for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005, increased by $0.1 million primarily due the exchange rate impact of the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Meridians SGA for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004, decreased primarily due to non recurring professional services fees incurred in 2004 related to the Companys Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 compliance initiative. Corporate Support SGA. Corporate Support SGA expenses include the expenses of sales and marketing activities, information technology services, the corporate data center, human resources, legal, accounting, treasury, administration, foreign currency translation, and stock based compensation charges. Corporate support represents the unallocated portion of corporate SGA expenses not specifically attributable to Accounts Payable Services or Meridian and totaled the following for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 25.6 $ 45.4 $ 47.5 The decrease in SGA for corporate support for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily the result of the Companys 2005 operational restructuring plan. In addition, during fiscal year 2005 the Company recorded a $3.9 million severance charge for the departure of Messrs. Cook and Toma. This compares to a charge of $1.4 million recorded in 2004 for Messrs. Cook and Tomas retirement benefits. In addition, during 2006 the Company was able to successfully sub lease approximately 20% of the space located in its corporate headquarters. The Company estimates that the subleases will have a positive cash flow impact of approximately $4 million over the next eight years. Corporate support SGA expenses in 2006 include $6.4 million of stock based compensation charges compared to $0.4 million in 2005 and less than $0.1 million in 2004. The 2006 charges include $2.6 million related to performance based options that were voluntarily surrendered for cancellation by the Companys chief executive officer and $3.4 million related to the Companys 2006 Management Incentive Plan. Operational Restructuring Expense On August 19, 2005, the Company announced that it had taken the initial step in implementing an expense restructuring plan, necessitated by the Companys declining revenue trend over the previous three years. Revenues for the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were $439.7 million, $367.4 million, $350.6 million and $292.2 million, respectively. With revenues decreasing in 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Companys selling, general and administrative expenses had increased as a percentage of revenue in each period (33.6%, 35.5% and 38.1%, respectively). The expense restructuring plan encompassed exit activities, including reducing the number of clients served, reducing the number of countries in which the Company operates, reducing headcount, and terminating operating leases. The operational restructuring expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Operational restructuring expense $ 4.1 $ 11.6 The Company initially expected that the implementation of the operational restructuring plan would result in severance related and other charges of approximately $14.6 million, most or all of which would be recognized prior to the end of 2006. Actual operational restructuring charges recognized in 2005 and 2006 totaled $15.7 million. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had recorded an $11.6 million charge related to the restructuring, $10.0 million 31 Table of Contents of which was for severance pay and benefits costs and $1.6 million of which related to early termination of operating leases. As of December 31, 2005 the Company had paid out approximately $2.8 million of severance and as of December 31, 2006 a total of $11.2 million of severance had been paid. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had accrued $1.2 million of early lease termination costs and leasehold improvement impairment charges of $0.4 million related to these leases. In 2006, the Company recorded additional restructuring charges for early termination costs of $1.4 million and leasehold improvement impairment charges of $0.5 million. The 2006 operational restructuring charges also included $2.2 million related to severance pay and related benefits costs. As of December 31, 2006, the operational restructuring plan as originally contemplated and approved in 2005 had essentially been completed. Management plans to continue to diligently manage costs on an ongoing basis. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company implemented additional headcount reductions resulting in estimated annualized savings of approximately $6.5 million. As a result of this action, the Company recorded approximately $4 million of severance charges not classified as operational restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2006. Discontinued Operations On October 30, 2001, the Company consummated the sale of its Logistics Management Services business to Platinum Equity, a firm specializing in acquiring and operating technology organizations and technology enabled service companies worldwide. The transaction yielded initial gross sale proceeds, as adjusted, of approximately $9.5 million with up to an additional $3.0 million payable in the form of a revenue based royalty over four years. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2004 of $0.3 million, net of tax expense of $0.2 million, representing the receipt of a portion of the revenue based royalty. During 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized additional gains on the sale of discontinued operations of $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to the receipt of the final portions of the revenue based royalty from the sale. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company classified its Channel Revenue and Airline businesses, and the Accounts Payable Service business units in South Africa and Japan, as discontinued operations. The South Africa and Japan Accounts Payable Services business units were closed during 2005. On January 11, 2006, the Company consummated the sale of its Channel Revenue business. The Channel Revenue business was sold for $0.4 million in cash to Outsource Recovery, Inc. Outsource Recovery also undertook to pay the Company an amount equal to 12% of gross revenues received by Outsource Recovery during each of the calendar years 2006 through 2009 with respect to the Channel Revenue business. The Company recognized a 2006 gain on sale of $0.3 million related to the sale of the Channel Revenue business. On July 17, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its Airline business to a former employee. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recognized a loss of $0.3 million relating to the sale of the Airline business unit. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company declared its remaining Communications Services operations, formerly part of the Companys then existing Other Ancillary Services segment, as a discontinued operation. On January 16, 2004, the Company consummated the sale of the remaining Communications Services operations to TSL (DE) Corp., a newly formed company whose principal investor was One Equity Partners, the private equity division of Bank One. The operations were sold for approximately $19.1 million in cash paid at closing, plus the assumption of certain liabilities of Communications Services. In 2004, the Company recognized a gain from the sale of approximately $8.3 million, net of tax expense of approximately $5.5 million. On December 14, 2001, the Company consummated the sale of its French Taxation Services business (ALMA), as well as certain notes payable due to the Company, to Chequers Capital, a Paris based private equity firm. In conjunction with this sale, the Company provided the buyer with certain warranties. Effective December 30, 2004, the Company, Meridian and ALMA (the Parties) entered into a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which the Company paid a total of $4.7 million on January 3, 2005 to resolve the buyers warranty claims and a commission dispute with Meridian. During 2004, the Company recognized loss of $3.1 million for amounts not previously accrued to provide for these claims. No tax benefit was recognized in relation to the expense. The Settlement Agreement terminated all contractual relationships between the Parties and specified that the Parties renounce all complaints, grievances and other actions. Operating losses of the discontinued operations up until their sale or closure for the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $1.1 million, $2.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Operating losses exclude general corporate overhead previously allocated to Communications Services and rent expense allocated to 32 Table of Contents the Airline unit. An income tax benefit of $1.1 million was allocated to earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in 2004. The net tax effects on earnings (loss) of discontinued operations were not significant in 2006 and 2005. Other Items Depreciation and Amortization. Net purchases of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $1.7 million, $5.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively. The significant decline in the amount of new purchases that has occurred over recent years has resulted in significant declines in depreciation and amortization expense as older purchased items become fully depreciated. A decline in depreciation and amortization expense is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Net Interest Expense. Net interest expense was $16.2 million, $8.4 million and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively (net of interest income of $0.9 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively). The Companys interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was comprised of interest expense and amortization of the discount related to the convertible subordinated notes and interest on borrowings outstanding under the Companys prior senior credit facility. The interest expense for 2005 as compared to 2004 was favorable by $0.1 million due to lower interest on borrowings outstanding under Companys prior senior credit facility. Net interest expense in 2006 increased significantly as a result of the Companys financial restructuring completed on March 17, 2006. The exchange of the convertible subordinated notes due November 2006 for the new senior convertible notes and new senior notes resulted in additional annual interest expense of approximately $7.7 million. Such amount may change in future periods. The Company has the option to pay interest on the new senior convertible notes in cash or in kind. Interest expense for 2006 also includes $0.9 million related to the excess of fair value over face value of the senior convertible notes which were issued on September 15, 2006 as paid in kind interest payments on the existing senior convertible notes. The Company has also incurred additional interest expense under its senior secured credit facility. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. to this Form 10 K. Income Tax Expense (Benefit). The Companys reported effective tax rates on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations approximated (11.1)%, (0.4)%, and 12,114% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The unusual 2005 rate is primarily attributable to the nondeductible portions of the impairment charges discussed above and the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The unusual 2006 and 2004 rates are primarily attributable to the changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $34.1 million of U.S. federal loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. The loss carryforwards expire through 2026. On March 17, 2006, the company experienced an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). This ownership change resulted in an annual IRC Section 382 limitation that mathematically limits the use of certain tax attribute carryforwards. Of the $34.1 million of U.S. federal loss carryforwards available to the Company, $27.1 million of the loss carryforwards are subject to an annual usage limitation of $1.4 million. The ownership change that took place in March 2006, resulted in the write off of approximately $72.6 million in previously incurred and unexpired federal net operating loss carryforward amounts and the write off of approximately $7.4 million in future tax deductions related to certain built in losses associated with intangible and fixed assets. The following write offs also took place in 2006 as a result of the ownership change: $34.1 million in unexpired capital loss carryforwards, $14.3 million in unexpired foreign tax credit carryforwards, and $0.2 million in unexpired RD credit carryforward amounts. Approximately $191.9 million of previously incurred and unexpired state net operating losses were also written off as a result of this ownership change. The write off of the tax attributes noted above resulted in a $62.8 reduction in the Companys deferred tax assets which was offset by a corresponding reduction in the previously established valuation allowance against these assets. As a result of the enactment of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, in 2004, the Company repatriated approximately $1.8 million of earnings that were previously indefinitely reinvested. As a result of this repatriation, the Company recorded additional current income tax expense of approximately $0.7 million during 2004. 33 Table of Contents Quarterly Results The following tables set forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the last eight quarters during the Companys fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The information has been derived from unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements that, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Certain reclassifications have been made to the first three quarters of 2006 to conform to the presentation adopted in the fourth quarter of 2006. 2006 Quarter Ended 2005 Quarter Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (In thousands, except per share data) Revenues $ 65,538 $ 65,308 $ 64,733 $ 70,516 $ 75,147 $ 78,162 $ 66,415 $ 72,428 Cost of revenues 47,257 48,246 45,172 53,072 48,595 50,997 48,057 47,442 Gross margin 18,281 17,062 19,561 17,444 26,552 27,165 18,358 24,986 Selling, general and administrative expenses 14,894 13,734 17,557 14,014 28,578 31,259 27,374 24,228 Impairment charges 170,375 Operational restructuring expense 408 1,580 153 1,989 7,922 3,628 Operating income (loss) 2,979 1,748 1,851 1,441 (2,026 ) (4,094 ) (16,938 ) (173,245 ) Interest expense, net (2,543 ) (4,269 ) (5,260 ) (4,147 ) (1,810 ) (2,061 ) (2,089 ) (2,431 ) Gain (loss) on financial restructuring (10,129 ) 82 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations (9,693 (2,521 ) (3,327 ) (2,706 ) (3,836 ) (6,155 ) (19,027 ) (175,676 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 650 338 726 305 687 412 715 (993 ) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before discontinued operations (10,343 ) (2,859 ) (4,053 ) (3,011 ) (4,523 ) (6,567 ) (19,742 ) (174,683 ) Discontinued operations: Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations and disposals, net 49 (786 ) (181 ) 85 (373 ) 275 (1,056 ) (1,071 ) Net earnings (loss) $ (10,294 ) $ (3,645 ) $ (4,234 ) $ (2,926 ) $ (4,896 ) $ (6,292 ) $ (20,798 ) $ (175,754 ) Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share: Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before discontinued operations $ (1.67 ) $ (0.50 ) $ (0.66 ) $ (0.44 ) $ (0.73 ) $ (1.06 ) $ (3.18 ) $ (28.15 ) Discontinued operations 0.01 (0.12 ) (0.03 ) 0.01 (0.06 ) 0.04 (0.17 ) (0.17 ) Net earnings (loss) $ (1.66 ) $ (0.62 ) $ (0.69 ) $ (0.43 ) $ (0.79 ) $ (1.02 ) $ (3.35 ) $ (28.32 ) Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $25.4 million, $(8.0) million and $10.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was the result of the Companys focus on improving working capital and reducing overall expenses. As of December 31, 2006 the Companys days sales outstanding (DSO) had improved by 18% compared to the prior year, providing in excess of $7.2 million of additional cash. Renegotiating and paying vendors according to terms provided an additional $5.2 million. Cash used by operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of a $205.5 million loss from continuing operations largely offset by noncash impairment, depreciation and amortization charges of $186.8 million and a $17.7 million reduction in receivable balances. Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 was principally influenced by the offset of a loss from continuing operations by a non cash charge to provide a valuation allowance against the Companys remaining deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2004, in addition to a release of restricted cash as a result of the Companys prior senior credit facility. 34 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 million, $5.4 million and $11.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for all three years was attributable to capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales. Net cash provided by (used in) in financing activities was $(0.2) million, $14.9 million and $(31.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net cash used by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily related to a new borrowing of $25 million used to pay off $16.8 million of existing debt and the payment of $7.5 million to professionals during the refinancing. Net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 related primarily to net borrowings on the Companys revolving credit facility and $10 million bridge loan. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 related primarily to repayment of amounts outstanding under the Companys previous senior credit facility. Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations was $(0.8) million, $(1.9) million and $17.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash used in discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily related to the wind down and professional expenses associated with selling of the Airlines business. Cash used in discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of net operating losses on the four business units classified as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2005 offset by the receipt of a portion of the revenue based royalty from the former Logistics Management Services segment that was sold in October 2001. Cash provided by discontinued operations during 2004 was the result of losses generated by the Communications Services operations prior to its sale on January 16, 2004 and net operating losses on the four business units classified as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2005 offset by proceeds of $19.1 million from the sale of the remaining Communications Services business in January 2004. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $35.0 million, and no borrowings under the revolver portion of its senior credit facility (see Financial Restructuring below). The revolver had approximately $17.0 million of calculated availability for borrowings. The Company had borrowings of $25.0 million outstanding under the term loan portion of its senior credit facility. Management believes that the Company will have sufficient borrowing capacity and cash generated from operations to fund its capital and operational needs for at least the next twelve months; however, current projections reflect that the Companys core accounts payable business will continue to decline. Therefore, the Company must continue to successfully manage its expenses and grow its other business lines in order to stabilize and increase revenues and improve profitability. 35 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments As discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K, the Company has certain contractual obligations and other commitments. A summary of those commitments as of December 31, 2006 is as follows: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Less More Than 3 5 Than Contractual obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 48,672 $ 9,051 $ 13,257 $ 9,576 $ 16,788 Capital lease obligations 1,089 61 726 302 Senior notes (1) 51,455 51,455 Interest on senior notes (1) 25,470 5,660 11,320 8,490 Senior convertible notes (2) 62,511 62,511 Interest on senior convertible notes (2) 28,130 6,251 12,502 9,377 Term Loan (3) 25,000 750 3,750 20,500 Series A convertible preferred stock (4) 16,225 16,225 Payments to Messrs.

Cook and Toma were revised see Executive Severance Payments below. Financial Restructuring On October 19, 2005 the Board of Directors of the Company formed a Special Restructuring Committee to oversee the efforts of the Company, with the assistance of its financial advisor, Rothschild Inc., to restructure the Companys financial obligations, including its obligations under its convertible subordinated notes due November 2006, and to improve the Companys liquidity. The Company successfully completed the financial restructuring on March 17, 2006. Pursuant to the financial restructuring, the Company exchanged: $400 principal amount of its 11.0% Senior Notes Due 2011, plus an additional amount of principal equal to accrued and unpaid interest due on the existing notes held by the tendering holders; $480 principal amount of its 10.0% Senior Convertible Notes Due 2011 convertible into common stock; and one share, $120 liquidation preference, of its 9.0% Senior Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock convertible into common stock; for each $1,000 principal amount of outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due November 2006. Approximately 99.3% of the aggregate $125 million outstanding convertible subordinated notes were tendered for exchange and accepted by the Company. The material terms of these new securities include: The new senior notes bear interest at 11%, payable semiannually in cash, and are callable at 104% of face in year 1, 102% in year 2, and at par in years 3 through 5. 36 Table of Contents The new senior convertible notes bear interest at 10%, payable semiannually in cash or in kind, at the option of the Company. The new senior convertible notes are convertible into common stock at a rate of approximately 153.8 shares per $1,000 principal amount. On September 15, 2006, the Company issued $2.9 million of additional senior convertible notes in lieu of the semiannual cash interest payment. The new Series A convertible preferred stock has a 9% dividend, payable in cash or in kind, at the option of the Company. The new Series A convertible preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holders into shares of common stock at the rate of $2.8405 of liquidation preference per share of common stock. As of December 31, 2006, 37,030 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock had been converted into 1,618,995 shares of common stock. The Series A convertible preferred stock has the right to vote with the Companys common stock on most matters requiring shareholder votes. The Company has the right to redeem the new senior convertible notes at par at any time after repayment of the new senior notes. The Company also has the right to redeem the new Series A convertible preferred stock at the stated liquidation preference at any time after repayment of the new senior notes and the new senior convertible notes. Both the new senior notes and the new senior convertible notes mature on the fifth anniversary of issuance. The new Series A convertible preferred stock must be redeemed on the fifth anniversary of issuance. As a part of its financial restructuring, the Company also entered into a new senior secured credit facility with Ableco LLC (Ableco) and The CIT/Group/Business Credit, Inc., a portion of which was syndicated to the Companys prior bridge financing lenders, Petrus Securities L.P. and Parkcentral Global Hub Limited (collectively, the Petrus Entities) and Blum Strategic Partners II GmbH Co. K.G. and Blum Strategic Partners II, L.P. (collectively, the Blum Entities). An affiliate of the Blum Entities was a member of the Ad Hoc Committee of noteholders of the Companys convertible subordinated notes due November 2006, with the right to designate one member of the Companys Board of Directors, and together with its affiliates, the Companys largest shareholder. The new credit facility includes (1) a $25.0 million term loan, and (2) a revolving credit facility that provides for revolving loan borrowings of up to $20 million. No borrowings are currently outstanding under the revolving credit facility. PRG Schultz USA, Inc., the Companys direct wholly owned subsidiary (the borrower), is the primary borrower under the senior secured credit facility, and the Company and each of its other existing and subsequent acquired or organized direct and indirect domestic wholly owned subsidiaries have guaranteed the facility. The borrowers and all of the Companys other subsidiaries obligations under the senior secured credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the Companys assets (including the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and two thirds of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries). The senior secured credit facility will expire on March 17, 2010, the fourth anniversary of the closing of the exchange offering. The term loan under the senior secured credit facility will amortize with quarterly payments beginning on the first anniversary of the closing date of $250,000 per quarter for the second year of the facility, and $500,000 per quarter for the third and fourth years of the facility, with the balance due at maturity on the fourth anniversary of closing. The term loan under the senior secured credit facility may be repaid at the Companys option at any time; provided, that any such pre payment in the first year shall be subject to a prepayment penalty of 3.0% of the principal amount pre paid, and pre payments in the second year shall be subject to a pre payment penalty of 2.0% of the principal amount pre paid. The term loan may be pre paid at any time following the 2nd anniversary of the closing date without penalty. The senior secured credit facility also provides for certain mandatory repayments, including a portion of our consolidated excess cash flow (which will be based on an adjusted EBITDA calculation), sales of assets and sales of certain debt and equity securities, in each case subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. The Companys ability to borrow revolving loans under the senior secured credit facility is limited to a borrowing base of a percentage of our eligible domestic receivables, subject to adjustments. Based on this borrowing base calculation, the Company had approximately $15.0 million of availability under the revolving credit facility at the closing of the exchange offer. 37 Table of Contents The interest on the term loan is based on a floating rate equal to the reserve adjusted London inter bank offered rate, or LIBOR, plus 8.5% (or, at our option, a published prime lending rate plus 5.5%). The interest rate on outstanding revolving credit loans is based on LIBOR plus 3.75% (or, at our option, a published prime lending rate plus 1.0%). The Company will also pay an unused commitment fee on our revolving credit facility of 0.5%. The senior secured credit facility also required the payment of commitment fees, closing fees and additional expense reimbursements of approximately $1.1 million at closing. The senior secured credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and conditions to borrowing. The senior secured credit facility also contains a number of financial maintenance and restrictive covenants that are customary for a facility of this type, including without limitation (and subject to certain exceptions and qualifications): maximum capital expenditures (to be measured annually); maximum total debt to EBITDA (to be measured quarterly); minimum EBITDA (to be measured quarterly); minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (to be measured quarterly); provision of financial statements and other customary reporting; notices of litigation, defaults and un matured defaults with respect to material agreements; compliance with laws, permits and licenses; inspection of properties, books and records; maintenance of insurance; limitations with respect to liens and encumbrances, dividends and retirement of capital stock, guarantees, sale and lease back transactions, consolidations and mergers, investments, capital expenditures, loans and advances, and indebtedness; compliance with pension, environmental and other laws, operating and capitalized leases, and limitations on transactions with affiliates and prepayment of other indebtedness. The senior secured credit facility contains customary events of default, including non payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, failure to comply with covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, loss of lien perfection or priority, material judgments, bankruptcy events and change of ownership or control. Transaction Costs of Financial Restructuring, Including Exchange Offer In connection with the exchange offer and the financial restructuring, the Company incurred a total of approximately $9.0 million of transaction costs including legal and financial advisory fees. These costs included fees and expenses of the Ad Hoc Committee for noteholders paid by the Company. Forbearance Agreement As of December 31, 2005, the Company was not in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its prior senior credit facility. On November 8, 2005, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement with the Lender and each of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement, the Lender agreed to forbear from exercising any right or remedy under the prior senior credit facility and related credit documents (including, without limitation, the right to cease making revolving loans) or applicable law, but only to the extent that such right or remedy arose exclusively as a result of the occurrence of certain acknowledged events of default; however, the Lender did retain its right to prohibit certain payments to the holders of the Companys 43/4% convertible subordinated notes. In addition to the financial covenant defaults discussed above, the acknowledged events of default included the failure to provide information and documentation regarding certain of the Companys subsidiaries. In consideration of the Lenders willingness to enter the Forbearance Agreement, the Company paid the Lender a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $0.1 million and agreed to reimburse certain expenses of the Lender and its counsel. The Company satisfied all of its obligations under the Forbearance Agreement, and replaced the prior senior credit facility with its new senior facility, discussed above, on March 17, 2006. In consideration of the willingness of the Lender to enter into the Forbearance Agreement, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries released the Lender and certain of its affiliates from any and all damages and liabilities of whatever kind or nature, known or unknown, relating to or arising under the prior senior credit facility, excluding any ongoing obligations the Lender had pursuant to the prior senior credit facility. 38 Table of Contents $10 million Bridge Loan On December 23, 2005, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement, Security Agreement and Pledge Agreement with Petrus Securities L.P. and Parkcentral Global Hub Limited (collectively, the Petrus Entities) and Blum Strategic Partners II GmbH Co. K.G. and Blum Strategic Partners II, L.P. (collectively, the Blum Entities). These agreements provided for a term loan to PRG Schultz USA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Borrower), in an aggregate principal amount of $10 million that matured on the earlier of the closing of the Companys restructuring of its debt or August 15, 2006 (the Bridge Loan). This loan was repaid and replaced by the new credit facility on March 17, 2006. The Blum Entities are beneficial owners of the Companys common stock and the new securities issued in the Companys recent financial restructuring, and they have the right to designate a member of the Companys Board of Directors and to have an observer present at all Board meetings. The Petrus Entities are also beneficial owners of the Companys common stock and the new securities issued in the restructuring. The Petrus Entities and Blum Capital Partners L.P. served on the Ad Hoc Committee of noteholders of the Companys convertible subordinated notes due November 2006. Prior Senior Credit Facility The Companys prior senior credit facility with Bank of America (the Lender) provided for revolving credit loans up to a maximum amount of $30.0 million, limited by the Companys accounts receivable balances. The prior senior credit facility provided for the availability of Letters of Credit subject to a $10.0 million sub limit. The prior senior credit facility was retired and replaced by the new senior credit facility discussed above, in connection with the closing the exchange offer. Executive Severance Payments The July 31, 2005 retirements of the Companys former Chairman, President and CEO, John M. Cook, and the Companys former Vice Chairman, John M. Toma, resulted in an obligation to pay retirement benefits of $7.0 million to be paid in monthly cash installments principally over a three year period, beginning February 1, 2006. On March 16, 2006, the terms of the applicable severance agreements were amended in conjunction with the Companys financial restructuring. Pursuant to the terms of the severance agreements, as amended (1) the Companys obligations to pay monthly cash installments to Mr. Cook and Mr. Toma have been extended from 36 months to 58 months and from 24 months to 46 months, respectively; however, the total dollar amount of monthly cash payments to be made to each remains unchanged, and (2) the Company agreed to pay a fixed sum of $150,000 to CT Investments, LLC, to defray the fees and expenses of the legal counsel and financial advisors to Messrs. Cook and Toma. The original severance agreements, and the severance agreements, as amended, provide for an annual reimbursement, beginning on or about February 1, 2007, to Mr. Cook and Mr. Toma for the cost of health insurance for themselves and their respective spouses (not to exceed $25,000 and $20,000, respectively, subject to adjustment based on changes in the Consumer Price Index), continuing until each reaches the age of 80. Charges of $3.9 million, $1.4 million and $2.3 million had been accrued in 2005, 2004 and 2003 and prior years, respectively, related to these retirement obligations. Bankruptcy Litigation On April 1, 2003, Fleming Companies, one of the Companys larger U.S. Accounts Payable Services clients at the time filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the Company received approximately $5.6 million in payments on account from Fleming. On January 24, 2005, the Company received a demand from the Fleming Post Confirmation Trust (PCT), a trust which was created pursuant to Flemings Chapter 11 reorganization plan to represent the client, for preference payments received by the Company. The demand stated that the PCTs calculation of the preferential payments was approximately $2.9 million. The Company disputed the claim. Later in 2005, the PCT filed suit against the Company seeking to recover approximately $5.6 million in payments that were made to the Company by Fleming during the 90 days preceding Flemings bankruptcy filing, and that are alleged to be avoidable either as preferences or fraudulent transfers under 39 Table of Contents the Bankruptcy Code. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to certain of the PCTs claims in the proceeding. In December 2005, the PCT offered to settle the case for $2 million. The Company countered with an offer to waive its bankruptcy claim and to pay the PCT $250,000. The PCT rejected the Companys settlement offer, and although the parties have agreed to settlement mediation, the litigation is ongoing. French Taxation Services Settlement On December 14, 2001, the Company consummated the sale of its French Taxation Services business (ALMA), as well as certain notes payable due to the Company, to Chequers Capital, a Paris based private equity firm. In conjunction with this sale, the Company provided the buyer with certain warranties. Effective December 30, 2004, the Company, Meridian and ALMA (the Parties) entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Agreement) pursuant to which the Company paid a total of $4.7 million, to resolve the buyers warranty claims and a commission dispute with Meridian. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a loss on discontinued operations of $3.1 million for amounts not previously accrued to provide for those claims. No tax benefit was recognized in relation to the expense. The Agreement settles all remaining indemnification obligations and terminates all contractual relationships between the Parties and further specifies that the Parties will renounce all complaints, grievances and other actions. Contingent Obligation to Repay Industrial Development Authority of Ireland Grant During the period of May 1993 through September 1999, Meridian received grants from the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland (IDA) in the sum of 1.4 million Euros ($1.8 million at December 31, 2006 exchange rates). The grants were paid primarily to stimulate the creation of 145 permanent jobs in Ireland. As a condition of the grants, if the number of permanently employed Meridian staff in Ireland falls below 145 prior to September 23, 2007, the date the contingency expires, the grants are repayable in full. As of December 31, 2006, Meridian currently employed 213 permanent employees in Dublin, Ireland. The European Union (EU) has currently proposed legislation that will remove the need for suppliers to charge VAT on the supply of goods and services to clients within the EU. The effective date of the proposed legislation is currently unknown. Management estimates that the proposed legislation, if enacted as currently drafted, would eventually have a material adverse impact on Meridians results of operations from its VAT business. If Meridians results of operations were to decline as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation, it is possible that the number of permanent employees that Meridian employs in Ireland could fall below 145 prior to September 2007. Should such an event occur, the full amount of the grants previously received by Meridian will need to be repaid to IDA. However, management currently estimates that any impact on employment levels related to a possible change in the EU legislation will not be realized until after September 2007. As any potential liability related to these grants is not currently determinable, the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K does not include any expense related to this matter. Management is monitoring this situation and if it appears probable Meridians permanent staff in Ireland will fall below 145 and that grants will need to be repaid to IDA, the Company will recognize an expense at that time. Limitation on Tax Loss and Credit Carryforwards On March 17, 2006, as a result of the financial restructuring, the company experienced an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). This ownership change resulted in an annual IRC Section 382 limitation that mathematically limits the use of certain tax attribute carryforwards. Of the $34.1 million of U.S. federal net loss carryforwards available to the company, $27.1 million of the loss carryforwards are subject to an annual usage limitation of $1.4 million. The ownership change that took place in March 2006, resulted in the write off of approximately $72.6 million in previously incurred and unexpired federal net operating loss carryforward amounts and the write off of approximately $7.4 million in future tax deductions related to certain built in losses associated with intangible and fixed assets. The following write offs also took place in 2006 as a result of the ownership change: $34.1 million in unexpired capital loss carryforwards, $14.3 million in unexpired foreign tax credit carryforwards, and $0.2 million in unexpired RD credit carryforward amounts. Approximately $191.9 million of previously incurred and unexpired state net operating losses were also written off as a result of this ownership change. The write off of the tax attributes noted above resulted in a $62.8 reduction in the Companys deferred tax assets which was offset by a corresponding reduction in the previously established valuation allowance against these assets. 40 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, the Company did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of the SECs Regulation S K. New Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123(R). In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment(SFAS No. 123(R)). This pronouncement amended SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and superseded Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that companies account for awards of equity instruments issued to employees under the fair value method of accounting and recognize such amounts in their statements of operations. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective method and, accordingly, has not restated the consolidated statements of operations for periods prior to January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the Company is required to measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations over the service period over which the awards are expected to vest. The Company recognizes compensation expense over the indicated vesting periods using the straight line method. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. to this Form 10 K for information about stock based compensation recognized in 2006 under SFAS N0. 123(R). On December 15, 2005, the Companys Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized the immediate vesting of all outstanding unvested time vesting options that had option prices that were out of the money as of such date (the underwater stock options). This action accelerated the vesting of 263,762 options as of November 30, 2005. The accelerated options had option prices that ranged from $31.60 per share to $172.50 per share and a weighted average option price per share of $49.70. The optionees whose options were accelerated included, among others, David Cole, the non executive Chairman of the Board (15,000 options) and the following executive officers: James McCurry (50,000 options), James Moylan (37,500 options) and James Benjamin (7,500 options). The Compensation Committees decision to accelerate the vesting of these underwater stock options was made primarily to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these stock options in future financial statements upon the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Management estimated that compensation expense would be approximately $2.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.5 million lower in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, than if the vesting had not been accelerated. SFAS No. 154. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements (SFAS No. 154). SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle (including voluntary changes). Previously, changes in accounting principles were generally required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. The Company adopted this pronouncement beginning in fiscal year 2006. Such adoption did not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. FIN No. 48. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48). This Interpretation prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold that must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. The Interpretation also offers guidelines to determine how much of a tax benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently assessing and evaluating the impact this Interpretation will have on its consolidated financial statements. 41 Table of Contents SFAS No. 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with earlier application encouraged. Any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings (deficit) in the year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements. SAB 108. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice in how public companies quantify misstatements of financial statements, including misstatements that were not material to prior years financial statements. The Company adopted the provisions of SAB 108 effective December 31, 2006, as required. The adoption of such provisions did not impact the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 159. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). This standard permits an entity to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 also revises provisions of SFAS No. 115 that apply to available for sale and trading securities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption of this pronouncement will have on its consolidated financial statements. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Market Risk. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar although we transact business in various foreign locations and currencies. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide services. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the value of nonfunctional currency revenues decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens, the functional currency amount of revenues increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefit from a weaker dollar. We are therefore adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Given the number of variables involved in calculating our revenues and expenses derived from currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including multiple currencies and fluctuating transaction volumes, the Company believes that it cannot provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates that would be meaningful to investors. Interest Rate Risk. Our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our debt. At December 31, 2006, there were borrowings of $25.0 million outstanding under the term loan portion of the Companys senior credit facility. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $17.0 million available for revolving loans under the senior credit facility, but had no borrowings under the revolver portion of the new credit facility. The interest on the term loan is based on a floating rate equal to the reserve adjusted London inter bank offered rate, or LIBOR, plus 8.5% (or, at our option, a published prime lending rate plus 5.5%). The interest rate on outstanding revolving credit loans is based on LIBOR plus 3.75% (or, at our option, a published prime lending rate plus 1.0%). A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applicable to the term loan would result in an approximate $0.3 million change in pre tax income. Assuming full utilization of the revolving credit facility, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applicable to the revolver would result in an approximate $0.2 million change in pre tax income. Derivative Instruments. As a multi national company, the Company faces risks related to foreign currency fluctuations on its foreign denominated cash flows, net earnings, new investments and large foreign currency denominated transactions. The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage foreign currency risks. The use of financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce the risk to the Company. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it use leveraged financial instruments. The Company did not have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Stock Based Compensation. The Company estimates the fair value of awards of restricted shares and nonvested shares, as defined in SFAS 123(R), as being equal to the market value of the common stock. Also, under SFAS 123(R), companies must classify their share based payments as either liability classified awards or as equity classified awards. Liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled. The Company has classified its share based payments that are settled in cash as liability classified awards. The liability for liability classified awards is generally equal to the fair value of the award as of the balance sheet date times the percentage vested at the time. The change in the liability amount from one balance sheet date to another is charged (or credited) to compensation cost. Based on the number of liability classified awards outstanding as of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical $1.00 change in the market value of the Companys common stock would result in $0.3 million change in pre tax income. 43 Table of Contents
