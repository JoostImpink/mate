Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Certain statements contained herein and in Item 1. Business that relate to the Companys beliefs or expectations as to future events are not statements of historical fact and are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The Company intends any such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that the assumptions upon which such forward looking statements are based are reasonable within the bounds of its knowledge of its industry, business and operations, it can give no assurance the assumptions will prove to have been correct and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from the Companys expectations and beliefs include, among other things, the strength of the United States economy in general and, specifically, market conditions for the consumer products industry in the U.S. and abroad; the level of demand for the Companys services; unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations; changes in or weak consumer confidence and consumer spending; loss of key management and operational personnel; the ability of the Company to implement its business strategy and cost reduction plans and to realize anticipated cost savings; the ability of the Company to comply with the financial covenants contained in its debt agreements and obtain waivers or amendments in the event of non compliance; the ability of the Company to maintain an effective system of disclosure and internal controls and the discovery of any future control deficiencies or weaknesses, which may require substantial costs and resources to rectify; the stability of state, federal and foreign tax laws; the ability of the Company to identify and capitalize on industry trends and technological advances in the imaging industry; higher than expected costs associated with compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated benefits associated with the Companys ongoing information technology and business process improvement initiative or unanticipated costs or difficulties associated with integrating acquired operations; any impairment charges due to declines in the value of the Companys fixed and intangible assets, including goodwill; the stability of political conditions in foreign countries in which the Company has production capabilities; terrorist attacks and the U.S. response to such attacks; as well as other factors detailed in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company assumes no obligation to update publicly any of these statements in light of future events. 22 Table of contents Executive Overview Marketing, promotional and advertising spending by consumer products companies and retailers drives a majority of the Companys revenues. The markets served are primarily consumer packaged goods, retail and life sciences. The Companys principal business in this area involves producing graphic images for various applications. Generally, the Company or a third party creates an image and then the image is manipulated to enhance the color and to prepare it for print. The applications vary from consumer product packaging, including food and beverage packaging images, to retail advertisements in newspapers, including freestanding inserts (FSIs), magazine advertisements and the internet. The graphics process is generally the same regardless of the application. The following steps in the graphics process must take place to produce a final image: Strategic Analysis Planning and Messaging Conceptual Design Content Creation File Building Retouching Art Production Pre Media The Companys involvement with a clients project may involve all of the above steps or just one of the steps, depending on the clients needs. Each client assignment, or job, is a custom job in that the image being produced is unique, even if it only involves a small change from an existing image, such as adding a low fat banner on a food package. Essentially, such changes equal new revenue for the Company. The Company is paid for its graphic imaging work regardless of the success or failure of the food product, the promotion or the ad campaign. Historically, a substantial majority of the Companys revenues have been derived from providing graphic services for consumer product packaging applications. Packaging changes occur with regular frequency and lack of advance notice, and client turn around requirements are tight, thereby creating little backlog. There are regular promotions throughout the year that create revenue opportunities for the Company, such as: Valentines Day, Easter, Fourth of July, Back to School, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. In addition, there are event driven promotions that occur regularly, such as: the Super Bowl, Grammy Awards, World Series, Indianapolis 500 and the Olympics. Changing regulatory requirements also necessitate new packaging from time to time, as do the number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging, such as heart healthy, low in carbohydrates, enriched with essential vitamins, low in saturated fat and caffeine free. All of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs, in each case creating additional opportunities for revenue. Graphic services for the consumer products packaging industry generally involve higher margins due to the substantial expertise necessary to meet consumer products companies precise specifications and to quickly, consistently and efficiently bring their products to market, as well as due to the complexity and variety of packaging materials, shapes and sizes, custom colors and storage conditions. Through several acquisitions in 2004 and 2005, the Company increased the percentage of its revenue derived from providing graphics services to advertising and retail clients. These clients typically require high volume, commodity oriented premedia graphic services. Graphic services for these clients typically yield relatively lower margins due to the lower degree of complexity in providing such services, and the number and size of companies in the industry capable of providing such services. In 2013, approximately 9.9 percent of the Companys total revenues came from its largest single client. While the Company seeks to build long term client relationships, revenues from any particular client can fluctuate from period to period due to the clients purchasing patterns. Any termination of or significant reduction in the Company business relationship with any of its principal clients could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. During 2014, the Company expects to continue to implement operational and work force alignment actions, including continuing to focus on realigning the Companys management and organizational structure to provide, among other things, greater consistency and more common approaches to the services the Company provides to its clients. While the Company anticipates these actions will benefit the Company and its clients, changes to its organizational structure also may result in increased or unanticipated short term costs due to the realignment of responsibilities, roles and personnel functions. 23 Table of contents Recent Acquisitions The Company has completed approximately 60 acquisitions since 1965. The Companys recent acquisitions have significantly expanded its service offerings and its geographic presence, making it the only independent premedia firm with substantial operations in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia. As a result of these acquisitions, the Company is able to offer a broader range of services to its clients. Its expanded geographic presence also allows us to better serve its multinational clients demands for global brand consistency. Lipson Associates, Inc. and Laga, Inc. Effective October 19, 2011, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Lipson Associates, Inc. and Laga, Inc., which does business as Brandimage Desgrippes & Laga (Brandimage) and the assumption of certain trade account and business related liabilities. Brandimage provides services that seek to engage and enhance the brand experience, including brand positioning and strategy, product development and structural design, package design and environmental design. Brandimage operates in Chicago, Cincinnati, Paris, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Brandimage operates in conjunction with the Companys current brand development capabilities, which include the Companys Anthem brand. The net assets and results of operations of Brandimage are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 19, 2011 in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments. The purchase price was $24.6 million, consisting of $27.0 million paid in cash at closing, less $2.4 million received for a net working capital adjustment. Real Branding LLC. Effective November 10, 2010, the Company acquired Real Branding LLC (Real Branding), a United States based digital marketing agency. Real Branding provides digital marketing services to consumer product and entertainment clients through its location in Chicago. The net assets and results of operations of Real Branding are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of November 10, 2010 in the Americas operating segment. This business was acquired to strengthen the Companys ability to offer integrated strategic, creative and executional services across digital consumer touchpoints. The purchase price was $9.6 million, which included $3.4 million originally recorded as an estimated liability to the sellers for contingent consideration based on performance of the business for the years 2011 through 2014. The Company has determined, based on actual performance and current future projections, that no contingent consideration will be payable for any of the years covered by the acquisition agreement. Untitled London Limited. Effective September 17, 2010, the Company acquired the operating assets of Untitled London Limited, a United Kingdom based agency that provides strategic, creative and technical services for digital marketing. The net assets and results of operations of Untitled London Limited are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Europe operating segment, effective September 17, 2010. This business was acquired to expand the Companys digital marketing capabilities in Europe. The purchase price was approximately $0.9 million. Discontinued Operations On July 3, 2013, the Company completed the sale of various assets comprising its large format printing business located in Los Angeles, California. The net assets of the large format printing business were considered to be held for sale as of June 30, 2013. The large format printing business was considered to be outside of the Companys core business and was included in the Americas segment. The aggregate selling price for the business was $10.4 million, comprised of $8.2 million in cash, $2.0 million in a secured subordinated note and $0.2 million accrued as a receivable from the buyer for an estimated net working capital adjustment, which was settled in the first quarter of 2014. The results of operations of the business sold are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report and the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operation, prior to disposal, have been segregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recorded a loss of $6.3 million on the sale of the business, which is included in Income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Included in the net loss is a goodwill allocation of $7.0 million, representing a portion of the Companys Americas reporting segment goodwill which was allocated to the large format printing business. 24 Table of contents Financial Results Overview Net revenues for 2013 were $442.6 million compared to $441.3 million for 2012, an increase of $1.4 million, or 0.3 percent. The revenue increase in 2013 compared to the prior year reflects an increase in revenues from the Companys consumer products packaging accounts partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the Companys advertising and retail accounts. Revenues in 2013 compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency translation rates of approximately $2.6 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of certain of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries. Net revenues increased in the Europe and Asia Pacific segments in 2013 compared to the prior year, but were partially offset by a decrease in revenues in the Americas segment. The Americas segment decreased by $2.1 million, or 0.6 percent. The Europe segment increased by $1.4 million, or 1.6 percent and the Asia Pacific segment increased by $3.5 million, or 9.1 percent. The Companys unbilled services, composed primarily of unbilled labor and production overhead, decreased by $2.8 million at December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012. Consumer products packaging accounts revenues for 2013 were $384.1 million, or 86.8 percent of total revenues, as compared to $374.1 million, or 84.8 percent of total revenues, in the prior year, representing an increase of 2.7 percent. Retail and advertising accounts revenues of $58.5 million in 2013, or 13.2 percent of total revenues, decreased 12.9 percent from $67.2 million in the prior year. During 2013, the Company continued to see measured progress with its largest client channel, consumer packaged goods accounts, with their continued product and brand innovation activity in the areas of strategy and design. Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) was $270.6 million, or 61.1 percent of revenues, in 2013, a decrease of $9.3 million, or 3.3 percent, from $279.9 million, or 63.4 percent of revenues, in 2012. The decrease in cost of services during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to a decrease in labor related expenses, reflecting the Companys cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. Operating income (loss) increased by $55.2 million to an operating income of $24.2 million in 2013 from an operating loss of $31.0 million in 2012. The operating income percentage was 5.5 percent for 2013 compared to an operating loss of 7.0 percent in 2012. A significant portion of the operating loss in 2012 is attributable to a charge of $31.7 million related to the Companys decision to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan, as further described below. The change to an operating income in the current year compared to an operating loss in the prior year is also due to the lower cost of services in 2013 compared to 2012, as well as to reduced business and systems integration expenses, reduced acquisition integration and restructuring expenses and lower impairment of long lived assets. Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased $1.3 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2013 to $118.7 million from $120.0 million in 2012. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is a credit to income of approximately $0.5 million in 2013 for the reversal of a liability recorded in purchase accounting for a recent acquisitions that is no longer needed due to statute expiration. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2013 is a credit to income of approximately $0.2 million for reserve reductions at certain of the Companys vacant leased properties, for which changed circumstances and statute expirations required a revision in the estimate of future expenses related to the leases. These 2013 income credits compare to credits to income of approximately $0.6 million in 2012 for reversals of certain acquisition related liabilities, partially offset by an expense of approximately $0.5 million for reserve increases for certain of the Companys vacant leased properties. Excluding the effect of these credits to income in each respective year, the selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat in 2013 compared to 2012. The Company recorded a charge of $31.7 million in 2012 for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability attributable to the Companys decision to discontinue its participation in the GCC/IBT National Pension Plan. There was no similar charge in 2013, except for $0.8 million of accretion of the present value discount related to the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability, which is included in interest expense. Business and systems integration expenses, related to the Companys information technology and business process improvement initiative, decreased $4.6 million to $7.5 million in 2013 from $12.1 million in 2012, as the Companys investment in the system build phase is substantially complete. Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses, related to the Companys cost reduction and capacity utilization initiatives, decreased $3.5 million to $1.8 million in 2013 from $5.3 million in 2012, due to a reduced level of restructuring activities. In addition, impairment of long lived assets decreased $3.8 million to $0.5 million in 2013 from $4.3 million in 2012. The 2012 impairment charges included $3.8 million for customer relationship intangible assets at Company locations being restructured where projected cash flows did not support the carrying value of the assets and $0.5 million for fixed assets, mainly for real estate that was written down to its estimated market value. The 2013 impairment charges related primarily to a customer relationship intangible asset in the Americas segment where projected future cash flows did not support the carrying value. The Company recorded a net loss of $1.3 million on foreign exchange exposures in 2013 as compared to a net loss of $1.8 million in 2012. The net loss on foreign exchange exposures includes unrealized losses related primarily to currency exposure from intercompany debt obligations of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. Interest expense for 2013 was $4.3 million compared to $3.7 million for 2012, an increase of $0.7 million, or 18.4 percent. The increase in interest expense in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to $0.8 million of interest related to accretion of the present value discount recorded at year end 2012 in conjunction with the Companys estimated multiemployer pension withdrawal liability. 25 Table of contents In 2013, the Company recorded income from continuing operations of $13.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share compared to a loss from continuing operations of $23.6 million, or $0.91 per diluted share in 2012. The increase in profitability, year over year, is due, in part, to the $31.7 million charge recorded in 2012 related to the Companys multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, which did not repeat in 2013. In addition, the year over year reductions in business and systems integration expenses, acquisition integration and restructuring expenses and impairment of long lived assets contributed to the increase in profitability in 2013 as compared to 2012. In 2013, the Company recorded a $6.7 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of income, net of tax, from discontinued operations in 2012. The loss from discontinued operations in 2013 includes a $6.3 million loss from the sale of assets related to the Companys large format printing operation. In 2013, the Company recorded net income of $6.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $23.4 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, in 2012. Goodwill impairment The Companys intangible assets not subject to amortization consist entirely of goodwill. The Company performs a goodwill impairment test annually, or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company performs its annual impairment test as of October 1 each year. The Company performed the required goodwill impairment tests for 2013 and 2012 as of October 1, 2013 and October 1, 2012, respectively. The Company allocated its goodwill on a geographic basis to its operating segments, which were determined to be reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Using projections of operating cash flow for each reporting unit, the Company performed a step one assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit. The step one impairment analysis indicated no impairment of the goodwill for either year. Cost reduction and capacity utilization actions Beginning in 2008 and continuing to date, the Company incurred restructuring costs for employee terminations, obligations for future lease payments, fixed asset impairments, and other associated costs as part of its previously announced plan to reduce costs through a consolidation and realignment of its work force and facilities. The total expense recorded for 2013 was $1.8 million and is presented as Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The expense for the years 2008 through 2013 and the cumulative expense since the cost reduction programs inception was recorded in the following operating segments: Asia (in millions) Americas Europe Pacific Corporate Total Year ended December 31, 2013 $ 1.4 $ 0.3 $ 0.1 $ $ 1.8 Year ended December 31, 2012 4.3 0.9 0.1 5.3 Year ended December 31, 2011 0.7 0.6 0.1 1.4 Year ended December 31, 2010 1.1 0.5 0.5 2.1 Year ended December 31, 2009 3.4 1.4 1.0 0.4 6.2 Year ended December 31, 2008 5.5 3.6 0.2 0.9 10.2 Cumalative since program inception $ 16.4 $ 7.3 $ 1.4 $ 1.9 $ 27.0 It is estimated that cost savings resulting from the 2013 cost reduction actions was approximately $2.8 million for 2013 and will be approximately $6.4 million for 2014. Cost savings resulting from the 2012 cost reduction actions is estimated to have been approximately $5.5 million for 2012 and $16.6 million annually over the subsequent two year period. Cost savings resulting from the 2011 cost reduction actions is estimated to have been approximately $2.0 million for 2011 and $5.0 million annually over the subsequent two year period. Cost savings resulting from the 2010 cost reduction actions is estimated to have been approximately $4.9 million during 2010 and $10.9 million annually over the subsequent two year period. Cost savings resulting from the 2009 cost reduction actions is estimated to have been approximately $8.9 million during 2009 and $15.6 million annually over the subsequent two year period. Cost savings resulting from the 2008 cost reduction actions is estimated to have been approximately $7.4 million during 2008 and $21.9 million annually over the subsequent two year period. 26 Table of contents Multiemployer pension withdrawal expense The Company has eight bargaining units in the United States that participate in the GCC/IBT National Pension Plan pursuant to a number of collective bargaining agreements. In December 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized management to enter into good faith negotiations with the local bargaining units to effect a complete withdrawal from the pension plan. The negotiations with the local bargaining units continued during 2013, with negotiations for withdrawal completed with all but one bargaining unit by year end. The decision to exit the plan was made in order to mitigate potentially greater financial exposure to the Company in the future under the plan, which is significantly underfunded, and to facilitate the consideration of future changes to the Companys operations in the United States. Based on an analysis prepared by an independent actuary, the Company recorded an estimated liability at December 31, 2012 for its withdrawal from the pension plan of $31.7 million, which was the present value of the estimated future payments required for withdrawal. The payments are expected to total approximately $41.2 million, payable $2.1 million per year over a 20 year period, with the annual cash payments expected to commence on or about May 1, 2014. These payments were discounted at a risk free rate of 2.54 percent. The 2012 expense associated with the pension withdrawal liability is reflected in Multiemployer pension withdrawal expense on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). During 2013, the Company accreted $0.8 million of the present value discount, resulting in an estimated liability balance of $32.5 million at December 31, 2013, of which $1.3 million is included in Accrued expenses and $31.2 million is included in Other long term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013. The expense associated with the accretion of the present value discount is reflected in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). In 2011, the Company decided to terminate participation in the San Francisco Lithographers Pension Trust and provided notification that it would no longer be making contributions to the plan. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Companys decision triggered a withdrawal liability. The Company recorded an estimated liability of $1.8 million as of December 31, 2011 to reflect this obligation. The expense associated with the pension withdrawal liability is reflected in Multiemployer pension withdrawal expense on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The liability was settled during 2012 with a cash payment of $1.6 million, realizing a credit to income of $0.2 million thereon. Impairment of long lived assets The following table summarizes the impairment of long lived assets by asset category for the periods presented in this Form 10 K: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Intangible assets, other than goodwill $ 0.5 $ 3.8 $ Land and buildings 0.5 Total $ 0.5 $ 4.3 $ For the year ended December 31, 2013, impairment charges of $0.5 million related to intangible assets are included in Impairment of long lived assets on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The intangible asset impairment charge is comprised primarily of $0.5 million in the Americas operating segment for a customer relationship intangible asset for which future cash flows do not support the carrying value. For the year ended December 31, 2012, impairment charges of $4.3 million are included in Impairment of long lived assets on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The impairment of long lived assets includes $3.8 million related to impairments of intangible assets and $0.5 million related to impairment of fixed assets. The intangible asset impairment charges were for customer relationship intangible assets at Company locations being restructured for which projected cash flows did not support the carrying values. The Company recorded the customer relationship impairment charges in the Americas and Europe operating segments in the amounts of $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The fixed asset impairment charge of $0.5 million related to Company owned real estate in the Corporate segment which was written down to its estimated market value in 2012, in anticipation of a sale which was finalized in 2013. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2012, impairment charges of $0.2 million are included in Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). These impairment charges relate to building improvements at Company facilities in the Americas operating segment that were combined with other operating facilities or shut down and relate to the Companys ongoing restructuring and cost reduction initiatives. During 2011, charges of less than $0.1 million were recorded for the impairment of various fixed assets. In addition, there were $0.3 million of impairments, primarily for leasehold improvements related to the Companys cost reduction and capacity utilization initiatives which are included in Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Controls and Procedures In connection with managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of such period.

The revenue increase in 2013 compared to the prior year reflects an increase in revenues from the Companys consumer products packaging accounts partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the Companys advertising and retail accounts. Revenues in 2013 compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency translation rates of approximately $2.6 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of certain of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries. Net revenues increased in the Europe and Asia Pacific segments in 2013 compared to the prior year, but were partially offset by a decrease in revenues in the Americas segment. The Americas segment decreased by $2.1 million, or 0.6 percent. The Europe segment increased by $1.4 million, or 1.6 percent and the Asia Pacific segment increased by $3.5 million, or 9.1 percent. The Companys unbilled services, composed primarily of unbilled labor and production overhead, decreased by $2.8 million at December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012. Consumer products packaging accounts revenues for 2013 were $384.1 million, or 86.8 percent of total revenues, as compared to $374.1 million, or 84.8 percent of total revenues, in the prior year, representing an increase of 2.7 percent. Retail and advertising accounts revenues of $58.5 million in 2013, or 13.2 percent of total revenues, decreased 12.9 percent from $67.2 million in the prior year. During 2013, the Company continued to see measured progress with its largest client channel, consumer packaged goods accounts, with their continued product and brand innovation activity in the areas of strategy and design. Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) was $270.6 million, or 61.1 percent of revenues, in 2013, a decrease of $9.3 million, or 3.3 percent, from $279.9 million, or 63.4 percent of revenues, in 2012. The decrease in cost of services during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to a decrease in labor related expenses, reflecting the Companys cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. Operating income (loss) increased by $55.2 million to an operating income of $24.2 million in 2013 from an operating loss of $31.0 million in 2012. The operating income percentage was 5.5 percent for 2013 compared to an operating loss of 7.0 percent in 2012. A significant portion of the operating loss in 2012 is attributable to a charge of $31.7 million related to the Companys decision to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan, as further described below. The change to an operating income in the current year compared to an operating loss in the prior year is also due to the lower cost of services in 2013 compared to 2012, as well as to reduced business and systems integration expenses, reduced acquisition integration and restructuring expenses and lower impairment of long lived assets. Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased $1.3 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2013 to $118.7 million from $120.0 million in 2012. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is a credit to income of approximately $0.5 million in 2013 for the reversal of a liability recorded in purchase accounting for a recent acquisition that is no longer needed due to statute expiration. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2013 is a credit to income of approximately $0.2 million for reserve reductions at certain of the Companys vacant leased properties, for which changed circumstances and statute expirations required a revision in the estimate of future expenses related to the leases. These 2013 income credits compare to credits to income of approximately $0.6 million in 2012 for reversals of certain acquisition related liabilities, partially offset by an expense of approximately $0.5 million for reserve increases for certain of the Companys vacant leased properties. Excluding the effect of these credits to income in each respective year, selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat in 2013 compared to 2012. The Company recorded a charge of $31.7 million in 2012 for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability attributable to the Companys decision to discontinue its participation in the GCC/IBT National Pension Plan. There was no similar charge in 2013, except for $0.8 million of accretion of the present value discount related to the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability, which is included in interest expense. Business and systems integration expenses, related to the Companys information technology and business process improvement initiative, decreased $4.6 million to $7.5 million in 2013 from $12.1 million in 2012, as the Companys investment in the system build phase is substantially complete. Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses, related to the Companys cost reduction and capacity utilization initiatives, decreased $3.5 million to $1.8 million in 2013 from $5.3 million in 2012, due to a reduced level of restructuring activities. In addition, impairment of long lived assets decreased $3.8 million to $0.5 million in 2013 from $4.3 million in 2012. The 2012 impairment charges included $3.8 million for customer relationship intangible assets at Company locations being restructured where projected cash flows did not support the carrying value of the assets and $0.5 million for fixed assets, mainly for real estate that was written down to its estimated market value. The 2013 impairment charges related primarily to a customer relationship intangible asset in the Americas segment where projected future cash flows did not support the carrying value. The Company recorded a net loss of $1.3 million on foreign exchange exposures in 2013 as compared to a net loss of $1.8 million in 2012. The net loss on foreign exchange exposures includes unrealized losses related primarily to currency exposure from intercompany debt obligations of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. 29 Table of contents Interest expense for 2013 was $4.3 million compared to $3.7 million for 2012, an increase of $0.7 million, or 18.4 percent. The increase in interest expense in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to $0.8 million of interest related to accretion of the present value discount recorded at year end 2012 in conjunction with the Companys estimated multiemployer pension withdrawal liability. Income tax provision (benefit) was a $6.9 million provision in 2013 compared to a $10.9 million benefit for 2012. The effective tax rate was 34.3 percent for 2013 compared to an effective tax rate of 31.5 percent in 2012. Income (loss) from continuing operations was income of $13.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in 2013 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $23.6 million, or $0.91 per diluted share in 2012. The increase in profitability, year over year, is due, in part, to the $31.7 million charge recorded in 2012 related to the Companys multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, which did not repeat in 2013. In addition, the year over year reductions in business and systems integration expenses, acquisition integration and restructuring expenses and impairment of long lived assets contributed to the increase in profitability in 2013 as compared to 2012. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax was a loss of $6.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in 2013 compared to $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of income from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2012. The loss from discontinued operations in 2013 includes a $6.3 million loss from the sale of assets related to the Companys large format printing operation. Net income (loss) was $6.5 million of net income, or $0.25 per diluted share, in 2013 compared to a $23.4 million net loss, or $0.90 per diluted share, in 2012. Other Information Depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations was $18.1 million in 2013, compared to $17.4 million in 2012. The increase year over year is attributable in part to depreciation of certain portions of the Companys new enterprise resource planning system which were placed into service during 2013. Capital expenditures for 2013 were $13.2 million compared to $19.8 million in 2012. The capital expenditures in both periods principally reflect expenditures related to the Companys ongoing information technology and business process improvement initiative designed to improve customer service, business effectiveness and internal controls, as well as to reduce operating costs and decreased year over year as the Companys investment in the system build phase is substantially complete. 30 Table of contents The following table sets forth certain amounts, ratios and relationships from the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Comparative Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands) 2012 2011 $ Change % Change Net revenues $ 441,282 $ 427,421 $ 13,861 3.2 % Operating expenses: Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) 279,901 265,333 14,568 5.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 120,006 107,534 12,472 11.6 % Multiemployer pension withdrawal expense 31,480 1,846 29,634 nm Depreciation and amortization 17,416 16,331 1,085 6.6 % Business and systems integration expenses 12,086 8,467 3,619 42.7 % Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses 5,256 1,438 3,818 nm Impairment of long lived assets 4,281 40 4,241 nm Foreign exchange loss 1,823 1,112 711 63.9 % Operating income (30,967 ) 25,320 (56,287 ) nm Operating margin percentage (7.0 ) % 5.9 % Other income (expense): Interest income 129 59 70 nm Interest expense (3,652 ) (5,270 ) 1,618 (30.7 ) % Income from continuing operations before income taxes (34,490 ) 20,109 (54,599 ) nm Income tax provision (10,872 ) 697 (11,569 ) nm Income (loss) from continuing operations (23,618 ) 19,412 (43,030 ) nm Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 202 1,199 (997 ) 83.2 % Net income (loss) $ (23,416 ) $ 20,611 $ (44,027 ) nm Expressed as a percentage of revenues: Cost of services 63.4 % 62.1 % 130 bp Selling, general and administrative expenses 27.2 % 25.2 % 200 bp Multiemployer pension withdrawal expense 7.1 % 0.4 % 670 bp Depreciation and amortization 3.9 % 3.8 % 10 bp Business and systems integration expenses 2.7 % 2.0 % 70 bp Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses 1.2 % 0.3 % 90 bp Impairment of long lived assets 1.0 % % 100 bp Foreign exchange loss (gain) 0.4 % 0.3 % 10 bp Operating margin (7.0 ) % 5.9 % (1,290 ) bp bp basis points nm not meaningful 31 Table of contents Net revenues for 2012 were $441.3 million compared to $427.4 million for 2011, an increase of $13.9 million, or 3.2 percent. The revenue increase in 2012 compared to the prior year reflects an increase in revenues from the Companys consumer products packaging accounts partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the Companys advertising and retail accounts. The increase in revenue for 2012 attributable to the increase in revenues from acquisitions compared to 2011 was $22.5 million, or 5.1 percent of total revenues. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue would have decreased by $8.6 million or 2.0 percent. Revenues in 2012 compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency translation rates of approximately $3.1 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of certain of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries. Net revenues increased in all the segments in 2012 compared to the prior year. The Americas segment increased by $2.6 million, or 0.8 percent, the Europe segment increased by $9.9 million, or 13.0 percent and the Asia Pacific segment increased by $5.2 million, or 15.5 percent. The Companys unbilled services, composed primarily of unbilled labor and production overhead, decreased by $2.1 million at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011. Consumer products packaging accounts revenues for 2012 were $374.1 million, or 84.8 percent of total revenues, as compared to $349.2 million, or 81.7 percent of total revenues, in the prior year, representing an increase of 7.1 percent. Retail and advertising accounts revenues of $67.2 million in 2012, or 15.2 percent of total revenues, decreased 14.1 percent from $78.2 million in the prior year. During 2012, the Company continued to see measured progress with its largest client channel, consumer packaged goods accounts, with their continued product and brand innovation activity in the areas of strategy and design. However, new product introductions and packaging changes were slower than anticipated for the year as consumer packaged goods clients continue to exercise caution based on economic uncertainties and higher commodity prices. Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) was $279.9 million, or 63.4 percent of revenues, in 2012, an increase of $14.6 million, or 5.5 percent, from $265.3 million, or 62.1 percent of revenues, in 2011. The increase in cost of services in 2012 compared to the prior year was mainly due to an increase in labor costs and fringe benefits, reflecting the Companys recent acquisitions and expansion of client service offerings. The increase in labor and fringe benefits in 2012 was partially offset by a decrease in production services purchased from outside contractors, as well as small decreases in various other production overhead expenses during 2012. Operating income (loss) decreased by $56.3 million to an operating loss of $31.0 million in 2012 from an operating income of $25.3 million in 2011. The operating loss percentage was 7.0 percent for 2012 compared to an operating income of 5.9 percent in 2011. A significant portion of the operating loss in 2012 is attributable to a charge of $31.5 million related to the Companys decision to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan, as further described below. The remainder of the operating loss in 2012 compared to the prior years operating income was due to the increased cost of services in 2012 compared to the previous year as well as increases in certain operating expenses as further discussed below. Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased $12.5 million, or 11.6 percent, in 2012 to $120.0 million from $107.5 million in 2011. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2011 is a credit to income of approximately $3.3 million for a reduction in estimated contingent consideration payable related to the Companys 2010 acquisition of Real Branding compared to a credit to income of approximately $0.2 million in 2012 for the reversal of the remaining estimated contingent consideration payable for this acquisition. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2011 is a credit to income of approximately $0.8 million for the settlement of a lawsuit related to enforcement of a non compete agreement with the former owner of a business acquired by the Company. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for 2011 were reduced by approximately $1.0 million related to reserve reductions for certain of the Companys vacant leased properties, for which changed circumstances required revisions in the estimates of future expenses related to the leases. This compares to an expense of approximately $0.5 million in 2012 for reserve increases for certain of the Companys vacant leased properties, for which changed circumstances required revisions in the estimates of future expenses related to the leases. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2011 is a credit to income of approximately $0.8 million for a reduction in an employment tax reserve related to an acquisition completed in 2008 and for which the statute of limitations has partially expired. This compares to a credit to income of approximately $0.4 million in 2012 for a further reduction in this employment tax reserve due to additional statute of limitations lapses. Excluding the effect of these credits to income in each respective year, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 is principally due to increases in employee related costs. The Company recorded a net charge of $31.5 million in 2012 for multiemployer pension plan withdrawals compared to charges of $1.8 million recorded in 2011, an increase in expense of $29.6 million. The expense in 2012 is principally due to the Companys decision to discontinue its participation in the GCC/IBT National Pension Plan. The decision to exit the plan was made in order to mitigate potentially greater financial exposure to the Company in the future under the plan and to facilitate the consideration of future changes to the Companys operations in the United States for its operating units that contribute to the plan. The $1.8 million expense in 2011 related to the Companys decision to terminate participation in the San Francisco Lithographers Pension Trust. 32 Table of contents Business and systems integration expenses, related to the Companys information technology and business process improvement initiative, increased $3.6 million to $12.1 million in 2012 from $8.5 million in 2011. Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses, related to the Companys cost reduction and capacity utilization initiatives, were $5.3 million in 2012 compared to $1.4 million in 2011. In addition, the Company recorded $4.3 million for impairment of long lived assets in 2012, of which $3.8 million related to customer relationship intangible assets at Company locations being restructured where projected cash flows did not support the carrying value of the assets and $0.5 million for fixed assets, mainly for real estate that was written down to its estimated market value. In 2011, there were impairment charges of less than $0.1 million. The Company recorded a net loss of $1.8 million on foreign exchange exposures in 2012 as compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in 2011. The net loss on foreign exchange exposures includes unrealized losses related primarily to currency exposure from intercompany debt obligations of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. In order to mitigate foreign exchange rate exposure, the Company entered into several forward contracts, designated as fair value hedges, which resulted in expense for 2012 of $0.4 million, compared to $0.9 million of expense from hedging activities during 2011. In May 2012, the Company discontinued its foreign currency hedging program using forward contracts. Interest expense for 2012 was $3.7 million compared to $5.3 million for 2011, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 30.7 percent. The decrease in interest expense in 2012 compared to the prior year reflects $0.8 million of interest capitalized during 2012 in connection with the Companys information technology and business process improvement initiative and lower interest rates resulting from the Companys 2012 credit facility refinancing. Income tax provision (benefit) was a $10.9 million benefit in 2012 compared to a $0.7 million provision for 2011. The effective tax rate was 31.5 percent for 2012 compared to an effective tax rate of 3.5 percent in 2011. The lower effective tax rate in 2011 was primarily due to the release of valuation allowances during 2011 and changes in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings. Income (loss) from continuing operations was a loss of $23.6 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, in 2012 compared to income from continuing operations of $19.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted share in 2011. The decrease in profitability, year over year, is due, in part, to the $31.5 million charge recorded in 2012 related to the Companys multiemployer pension plan withdrawals. In addition, the year over year increases in business and systems integration expenses, acquisition integration and restructuring expenses and impairment of long lived assets contributed to the decrease in profitability in 2012 as compared to 2011. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax was income of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in 2012 compared to $1.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, of income from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2011. Net income (loss) was a $23.4 million net loss, or $0.90 per diluted share, in 2012 compared to $20.6 million of net income, or $0.79 per diluted share, in 2011. Other Information Depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations was $17.4 million in 2012, compared to $16.3 million in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2012 were $19.8 million compared to $24.7 million in 2011. The capital expenditures in both periods principally reflect expenditures related to the Companys ongoing information technology and business process improvement initiative designed to improve customer service, business effectiveness and internal controls, as well as to reduce operating costs. 33 Table of contents Segment Information During 2011, the Company renamed its North America operating segment to Americas to reflect its expansion into South America. Americas Segment The following table sets forth Americas segment results for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 $ % $ % Net revenues $ 331,380 $ 333,494 $ 330,879 $ (2,114 ) (0.6) % $ 2,615 0.8 % Cost of services $ 208,200 $ 217,808 $ 210,602 $ (9,608 ) (4.4) % $ 7,206 3.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 54,713 $ 57,294 $ 61,654 $ (2,581 ) (4.5) % $ (4,360 ) (7.6) % Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses $ 1,376 $ 4,245 $ 777 $ (2,869 ) (67.6) % $ 3,468 nm Foreign exchange loss $ 5 $ 185 $ (109) $ (180 ) (97.3) % $ 294 nm Multiemployer pension withdrawal expense $ $ 31,683 $ (31,683 ) nm $ 31,683 nm Impairment of long lived assets $ 466 $ 2,350 $ 40 $ (1,884 ) (80.2) % $ 2,310 nm Depreciation and amortization $ 9,054 $ 9,406 $ 9,287 $ (352 ) (3.7) % $ 119 1.3 % Operating income $ 57,566 $ 10,523 $ 48,628 $ 47,043 nm $ (38,105 ) (78.4) % Operating margin 17.4 % 3.2 % 14.7 % 1,420 bp (1,150) bp Capital expenditures $ 5,211 $ 5,648 $ 7,176 $ (437 ) (7.7) % $ (1,528 ) (21.3) % Total assets $ 326,745 $ 359,014 $ 361,189 $ (32,269 ) (9.0) % $ (2,175 ) (0.6) % bp basis points nm not meaningful 2013 compared to 2012 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 for the Americas segment were $331.4 million compared to $333.5 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of $2.1 million or 0.6 percent. The revenue decrease in 2013 compared to the prior year reflects an increase in revenues from the Companys consumer packaging accounts which was offset by a decrease in advertising and retail accounts. Revenues in the current year compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency transaction rates of $0.9 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries. Cost of services in the year 2013 was $208.2 million, or 62.8 percent of revenues, compared to $217.8 million, or 65.3 percent of revenues, in the prior year, a decrease of $9.6 million or 4.4 percent. The decrease in cost of services was mainly due to a decrease in labor related expenses, reflecting the Companys cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. Operating income was $57.6 million or 17.4 percent of revenues, in the year 2013 compared to $10.5 million, or 3.2 percent of revenues, in the year 2012, an increase of $47.0 million. The increase in operating income is principally due to the multiemployer pension withdrawal costs of $31.7 million in 2012 that did not occur in 2013, a decrease in cost of services noted above as well as lower acquisition and integration expenses and lower impairment of long lived assets in 2013 compared to the prior year. 34 Table of contents 2012 compared to 2011 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 for the Americas segment were $333.5 million compared to $330.9 million in the prior year, an increase of $2.6 million or 0.8 percent. Revenues contributed by acquisitions, mainly for Brandimage, totaled $14.6 million for 2012 compared to $2.5 million in the prior year, an increase of $12.1 million. Excluding the impact of revenues contributed by acquisitions, revenues in 2012 decreased by $9.5 million compared to 2011. Revenues for 2012, as compared to the prior years period were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency translation rates of approximately $0.7 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of certain of the Companys non US subsidiaries. The revenue decline in 2012, excluding the impact of acquisitions, compared to the prior year primarily reflects a reduction in promotional activity from the Companys advertising and retail accounts, as well as a slower rate of new product introductions and packaging changes from the Companys consumer packaged goods accounts as economic uncertainties continued. Cost of services was $217.8 million, or 65.3 percent of revenues, in 2012 compared to $210.6 million, or 63.6 percent of revenues, in 2011, an increase of $7.2 million or 3.4 percent. The increase during 2012 was mainly due an increase in labor and fringe benefits reflecting the Companys recent acquisitions and expansion of client service offerings. Operating income was $10.5 million, or 3.2 percent of revenues, in 2012 compared to $48.6 million, or 14.7 percent of revenues, in 2011, a decrease of $38.1 million. The decrease in operating income is principally due to the increase in costs year over year related to the multiemployer pension withdrawal costs of $31.7 million, acquisition integration costs of $3.5 million and $2.3 million of impairment of long lived assets. 35 Table of contents Europe Segment The following table sets forth Europe segment results for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 $ % $ % Net revenues $ 87,176 $ 85,763 $ 75,877 $ 1,413 1.6 % $ 9,886 13.0 % Cost of services $ 56,485 $ 56,802 $ 49,714 $ (317 ) (0.6 ) % $ 7,088 14.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 22,146 $ 22,275 $ 16,241 $ (129 ) (0.6 ) % $ 6,034 37.2 % Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses $ 293 $ 881 $ 586 $ (588 ) (66.7 ) % $ 295 50.3 % Foreign exchange loss $ 113 $ 207 $ 49 $ (94 ) (45.4 ) $ 158 nm Impairment of long lived assets $ $ 1,413 $ $ (1,413 ) nm $ 1,413 nm Depreciation and amortization $ 2,651 $ 3,206 $ 2,903 $ (555 ) (17.3 ) % $ 303 10.4 % Operating income $ 5,488 $ 979 $ 6,384 $ 4,509 nm % $ (5,405 ) (84.7 ) % Operating margin 6.3 % 1.1 % 8.4 % 520 bp (730 ) bp Capital expenditures $ 2,111 $ 1,256 $ 1,813 $ 855 68.1 % $ (557 ) (30.7 ) % Total assets $ 57,119 $ 54,746 $ 62,476 $ 2,373 4.3 % $ (7,730 ) (12.4 ) % bp basis points nm not meaningful 2013 compared to 2012 Net revenues in the Europe segment for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $87.2 million compared to $85.8 million in the prior year, an increase of $1.4 million or 1.6 percent. The net revenue increase is principally attributed to new product introductions and packaging changes, as well as the benefits of marketing partner consolidations by our clients. Revenues in the current year 2013 compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency translation rates of approximately $0.1 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries. The cost of services was $56.5 million, or 64.8 percent of revenues, in 2013, compared to $56.8 million or 66.2 percent of revenues in the prior year, a decrease of $0.3 million or 0.6 percent. Operating income was $5.5 million, or 6.3 percent of revenues, in 2013, compared to operating income of $1.0 million or 1.1 percent of revenues in the prior year, an increase of $4.5 million. The increase in operating income in the current period compared to the prior years period is mainly due to an increase in revenue, a decrease in acquisition and integration expenses of $0.6 million, as well as an impairment charge of $1.4 million in the 2012 period that did not repeat in the 2013 period. 2012 compared to 2011 Net revenues in the Europe segment for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $85.8 million compared to $75.9 million in the prior year, an increase of $9.9 million or 13.0 percent. Revenues contributed by acquisitions totaled $10.2 million in 2012 compared to $2.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $8.0 million, mainly from the Brandimage acquisition. Excluding the revenues attributable to acquisitions, revenues would have increased by $1.9 million. Revenues for 2012, as compared to 2011, were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency translation rates of approximately $2.2 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of certain of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries. Cost of services was $56.8 million, or 66.2 percent of revenues, in 2012 compared to $49.7 million, or 65.5 percent of revenues, in 2011, an increase of $7.1 million or 14.3 percent. The increase during 2012 was mainly due to an increase in labor and fringe benefits reflecting the Companys recent acquisitions and expansion of client service offerings, as well as an increase in production services purchased from outside contractors and other Company locations. Operating income was $1.0 million, or 1.1 percent of revenues, in 2012 compared to $6.4 million, or 8.4 percent of revenues in the prior year, a decrease of $5.4 million. The decrease in operating income in 2012 compared to the prior year is due primarily to the previously mentioned increase in cost of services and $1.4 million of impairment of long lived assets recorded in 2012, as well as higher selling, general and administrative costs in 2012 relative to the prior year, mainly resulting from credits to income during 2011 for reserve adjustments that did not repeat in 2012. 36 Table of contents Asia Pacific Segment The following table sets forth Asia Pacific segment results for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 $ % $ % Net revenues $ 42,454 $ 38,923 $ 33,704 $ 3,531 9.1 % $ 5,219 15.5 % Cost of services $ 24,244 $ 22,189 $ 18,056 $ 2,055 9.3 % $ 4,133 22.9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 13,529 $ 12,644 $ 10,095 $ 885 7.0 % $ 2,549 25.3 % Acquisition integration and restructuring expenses $ 104 $ 129 $ $ (25 ) (19.4 ) $ 129 nm Foreign exchange (gain) loss $ (85 ) $ 305 $ 63 $ (390 ) nm $ 242 nm Impairment of long lived assets $ 36 $ $ $ 36 nm $ Depreciation and amortization $ 1,430 $ 1,532 $ 1,292 $ (102 ) (6.7 ) % $ 240 18.6 % Operating income $ 3,196 $ 2,124 $ 4,198 $ 1,072 50.5 % $ (2,074 ) (49.4 ) % Operating margin 7.5 % 5.5 % 12.5 % 200 bp (700 ) bp Capital expenditures $ 825 $ 1,611 $ 1,108 $ (786 ) (48.8 ) % $ 503 45.4 % Total assets $ 24,813 $ 27,193 $ 31,032 $ (2,380 ) (8.8 ) % $ (3,839 ) (12.4 ) % bp basis points nm not meaningful 2013 compared to 2012 Net revenues in the Asia Pacific segment for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $42.5 million compared to $38.9 million in the prior year, an increase of $3.5 million or 9.1 percent. The increase in net revenues was mainly attributable to increased promotional activity from the Companys consumer products packaging accounts. Improvement in labor and capacity utilization of our Asian service capabilities and the reflection of declining hourly rates drove segment revenue reductions of $1.9 million in 2013, which benefit the Americas and Europe segments through reduced costs. Revenues in the current year 2013 compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency translation rates of approximately $1.6 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries. The cost of services was $24.2 million, or 57.1 percent of revenues, in 2013, compared to $22.2 million or 57.0 percent of revenues in the prior year, an increase of $2.1 million or 9.3 percent. The increase in cost of services during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to an increase in labor costs. Operating income was $3.2 million, or 7.5 percent of revenues, in 2013, compared to operating income of $2.1 million or 5.5 percent of revenues in the prior year, an increase of $1.1 million. The increase in operating income in the current period compared to the prior years period is due principally to the increase in net revenues. 2012 compared to 2011 Net revenues in the Asia Pacific segment for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $38.9 million compared to $33.7 million in the prior year, an increase of $5.2 million or 15.5 percent. Revenues contributed by acquisitions in 2012 totaled $3.0 million, compared to $0.6 million in 2011, an increase of $2.4 million, principally from the Brandimage acquisition. Excluding the revenues attributable to acquisitions, revenues would have increased by $2.8 million. Revenues for 2012, as compared to 2011, were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency translation rates of approximately $0.2 million, as the U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the local currencies of certain of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries. Cost of services was $22.2 million, or 57.0 percent of revenues, in 2012 compared to $18.1 million, or 53.6 percent of revenues, in 2011, an increase of $4.1 million or 22.9 percent. The increase during 2012 was mainly due to an increase in labor and fringe benefits reflecting the Companys recent acquisitions and expansion of client service offerings. Operating income was $2.1 million in 2012, or 5.5 percent of revenues, as compared to $4.2 million, or 12.5 percent of revenues, in 2011, a decrease of 2.1 million or 49.4 percent. The decrease in operating income in 2012 compared to the prior year is due principally to the previously mentioned increase in production costs as well as increases in selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by the increase in revenues year over year. 37 Table of contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures, support working capital requirements and service indebtedness. The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from its operating activities and borrowings under its credit agreement. The Companys total debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 was $57.9 million compared to $83.0 million at December 31, 2012 and $95.2 million at December 31, 2011. The decrease in debt during 2013 and 2012 primarily reflects the Companys paydown of outstanding amounts under its revolving credit facility and private placement debt using cash generated from operations. Debt was also reduced by $8.2 million due to cash proceeds from the sale of the Companys large format operation in 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $6.2 million in consolidated cash and cash equivalents, compared to $9.7 million at December 31, 2012 and $13.7 million at December 31, 2011. The Companys non U.S. cash balances were $5.6 million at December 31, 2013, compared to $6.7 million at December 31, 2012 and $13.7 million at December 1, 2011. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during 2013 and 2012 reflects the Companys efforts to minimize cash on hand in order to pay down its revolving credit facility. Cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $31.2 million in 2013 compared to $31.1 million in 2012. The cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 reflects the increase in net income, from a net loss of $23.4 million in 2012 to net income of $6.5 million for 2013. The 2013 period includes a $6.3 million non cash charge for a loss realized from the sale of a business, reflecting the Companys sale of its large format printing operation. The 2012 period included a $4.4 million non cash charge for impairment of long lived assets compared to $0.5 million in 2013. The cash provided from operations in 2013 compared to 2012 also reflects less favorable changes in the operating assets and liabilities during 2013 compared to 2012. The year over year change in operating assets and liabilities includes a decrease in cash provided by operating activities attributable to an increase in trade accounts receivable of $7.3 million in 2013 compared to an increase in cash provided by operating activities attributable to a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $7.5 million in 2012. In addition, there was an increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 attributable to an increase in multiemployer pension withdrawal liabilities of $29.8 million during the year, which did not repeat in 2013. At year end 2012, the Company recorded a $31.7 million estimated liability for a multiemployer pension withdrawal, which remained unchanged during 2013 except for $0.8 million of accretion of the present value discount related to the estimated liability. The cash provided by operating activities in 2012 also reflected a decrease in operating cash attributable to a $10.5 million deferred income tax benefit related primarily to the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability. Cash provided by operating activities was $31.1 million in 2012 compared to $9.5 million in 2011. The cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects the decrease in net income, from net income of $20.6 million for 2011 to a net loss of $23.4 million for 2012. The cash decrease attributable to the decline in net income year over year was partially offset by increases in non cash expenses in 2012. The 2012 period includes a $4.4 million non cash charge for impairment of long lived assets as well as higher non cash expenses for depreciation and stock based compensation as compared to the prior period. The cash provided from operations in 2012 also reflects changes in operating assets and liabilities that increased operating cash by $38.3 million during 2012. The 2012 increase in operating assets and liabilities includes an increase in multiemployer pension withdrawal liability of $29.8 million, reflecting $31.7 million recorded as an estimated multiemployer pension withdrawal liability in 2012, partially offset by a $1.8 million settlement during 2012 of a multiemployer pension withdrawal liability recorded in 2011. In addition, the 2012 change in operating assets and liabilities includes a $5.7 million decrease in trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities during 2012, reflecting a decrease in various accrued expenses and other liabilities. The 2012 change in operating assets and liabilities also reflects an increase in cash provided by operating activities attributable to a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $7.5 million, reflecting the Companys improvement in cash collections, and a decrease in inventory, principally composed of the cost of unbilled client services, of $2.8 million. The cash provided by operating activities in 2012 also reflects a decrease in operating cash attributable to a $10.5 million deferred income tax benefit related primarily to the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability recorded in 2012. Depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense in 2013 was $14.7 million and $4.1 million, respectively, as compared to $13.7 million and $5.2 million, respectively, in 2012 and $12.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively, in 2011. Cash used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $4.6 million in 2013 compared to $17.3 million in 2012. Capital expenditures were $13.2 million in 2013 compared to $19.8 million in 2012. The capital expenditures in both periods principally reflect expenditures related to the Companys ongoing information technology and business process improvement initiative designed to improve customer service, business effectiveness and internal controls, as well as to reduce operating costs and decreased year over year as the Companys investment in the system build phase is substantially complete. Partially offsetting the cash used in investing activities related to capital expenditures during 2013 was $8.2 million received from the sale of the Companys large format printing operation. Over the next five years, assuming no significant business acquisitions, routine capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $9.0 to $11.0 million annually. Cash used in investing activities was $17.3 million in 2012 compared to $49.8 million in 2011. Capital expenditures were $19.8 million in 2012 compared to $24.7 million in 2011, with both periods principally reflecting expenditures related to the Companys ongoing information technology and business process improvement initiative. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 reflects the decrease in capital expenditures during 2012 compared to 2011, as well as a decrease in cash used for acquisitions. Cash paid for acquisitions in 2011 was $25.2 million, principally reflecting the acquisition of Brandimage. Cash received during 2012 related to acquisitions reflects $2.4 million received in 2012 for a net working capital adjustment related to the Brandimage acquisition. 38 Table of contents Cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $31.2 million compared to $18.9 million during 2012. The cash used in financing activities in 2013 reflects $24.9 million of net payments of debt compared to $12.4 million of net payments of debt during 2012. The decrease in debt during both 2013 and 2012 reflects the Companys paydown of outstanding amounts under its revolving credit facility and private placement debt using cash generated from operations. The Company received proceeds of $1.8 million from the issuance of common stock during 2013 compared to $2.4 million during 2012. The issuance of common stock in both periods is attributable to stock option exercises and issuance of shares pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan. Dividend payments on common stock at $0.08 per share quarterly were $8.4 million for 2013 compared to $8.3 million in 2012. Subject to a declaration at the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company expects quarterly dividends at $0.08 per share to continue for 2014. Cash used in financing activities in 2012 was $18.9 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $17.8 million during 2011. The cash used in financing activities in 2012 reflects $12.4 million of net payments of debt compared to $28.6 million of net proceeds of debt during 2011. The increase in debt during 2011 reflects the Companys purchase of Brandimage in the fourth quarter of that year. The Company received proceeds of $2.4 million from the issuance of common stock during 2012 compared to $1.2 million during 2011. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in 2012, whereas $4.1 million was used to repurchase shares during 2011. Dividend payments on common stock at $0.08 per share quarterly were $8.3 million for 2012 compared to $8.2 million during 2011. Credit Facility and Senior Notes Revolving Credit Facility Amended and Restated Credit Facility. On January 27, 2012, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2012 Credit Agreement), among the Company, certain subsidiary borrowers of the Company, the financial institutions party thereto as lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., on behalf of itself and the other lenders as agent, and PNC Bank, National Association, on behalf of itself and the other lenders as syndication agent, in order to amend and restate the Companys prior credit agreement that was scheduled to terminate on July 12, 2012. The 2012 Credit Agreement provides for a five year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $125.0 million (the Credit Facility), including a $10.0 million swing line loan subfacility and a $10.0 million subfacility for letters of credit. The Company may, at its option and subject to certain conditions, increase the amount of the Credit Facility by up to $50.0 million by obtaining one or more new commitments from new or existing lenders to fund such increase. Loans under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a LIBOR or Federal funds rate plus a margin that varies with the Companys cash flow leverage ratio, in addition to applicable commitment fees, with a maximum rate of LIBOR plus 225 basis points. At closing, the applicable margin on LIBOR based loans was 175 basis points. The unutilized portion of the Credit Facility will be used primarily for general corporate purposes, such as working capital and capital expenditures, and, to the extent opportunities arise, acquisitions and investments. At December 31, 2013, there was $25.0 million outstanding under the LIBOR portion of the facility at an interest rate of approximately 1.88 percent. At the Companys option, loans under the facility can bear interest at prime plus 1.5 percent. At December 31, 2013, there was $6.3 million of prime rate borrowing outstanding at an interest rate of 4.00 percent. The Companys Canadian subsidiary borrowed under the revolving credit facility in the form of bankers acceptance agreements and prime rate borrowings. At December 31, 2013, there was $0.3 million outstanding under prime rate borrowings at an interest rate of approximately 3.75 percent. The 2012 Credit Agreement contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Under the terms of the 2012 Credit Agreement, the Company is not subject to restrictive covenants on permitted capital expenditures. Certain restricted payments, such as regular dividends and stock repurchases, are permitted provided that the Company maintains compliance with its minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (with respect to regular dividends) and a specified maximum cash flow leverage ratio (with respect to other permitted restricted payments). Other covenants include, among other things, restrictions on the Companys and in certain cases its subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; dispose of assets; create or permit liens on assets; make loans, advances or other investments; incur certain guarantee obligations; engage in mergers, consolidations or acquisitions, other than those meeting the requirements of the 2012 Credit Agreement; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain hedging arrangements. The 2012 Credit Agreement also requires compliance with specified financial ratios and tests, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum cash flow ratio. Amendment to the 2012 Credit Agreement. On September 12, 2012, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Credit Agreement Amendment) to the 2012 Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement Amendment amended the definition of EBITDA in the 2012 Credit Agreement to permit the Company, for purposes of calculating EBITDA for financial covenant compliance, to add back certain expenses associated with the Companys enterprise resource planning system up to certain amounts as specified in the Credit Agreement Amendment. 39 Table of contents Senior Notes In 2003, the Company entered into a private placement of debt to provide long term financing in which it issued senior notes pursuant to note purchase agreements, which have since been amended as further discussed below. The senior note that was outstanding at December 31, 2013 bears interest at 8.98 percent. The remaining aggregate balance of the note, $1.2 million, is included in Current portion of long term debt on the December 31, 2013 Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amended and Restated Private Shelf Agreement. Concurrently with its entry into the 2012 Credit Agreement, on January 27, 2012, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (Prudential) and certain existing noteholders and note purchasers named therein (the Private Shelf Agreement), which provides for a $75.0 million private shelf facility for a period of up to three years (the Private Shelf Facility). At closing, the Company issued $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.38% Series F Senior Notes due January 27, 2019 (the Notes) under the Private Shelf Agreement, which principal amount remained outstanding at December 31, 2013. The Private Shelf Agreement contains financial and other covenants that are the same or substantially equivalent to covenants under the 2012 Credit Agreement described above. Notes issued under the Private Shelf Facility may have maturities of up to ten years and are unsecured. Either the Company or Prudential may terminate the unused portion of the Private Shelf Facility prior to its scheduled termination upon 30 days written notice. Any future borrowings under the Private Shelf Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, such as working capital and capital expenditures. Amendment to Note Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with the entry into the Private Shelf Agreement, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment) to the Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2003, as amended (the Note Purchase Agreement), with the noteholders party thereto (the Mass Mutual Noteholders). The Fifth Amendment amended certain financial and other covenants in the Note Purchase Agreement so that such financial and other covenants are the same or substantially equivalent to covenants under the 2012 Credit Agreement described above. The Fifth Amendment also amended certain provisions contained in the Note Purchase Agreement to reflect that amounts due under existing senior notes issued to the Mass Mutual Noteholders are no longer secured. Amendments to Private Shelf Agreement and Note Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with its entry into the Credit Agreement Amendment, the Company entered into (i) the First Amendment (the First Amendment) to the Private Shelf Agreement and (ii) the Sixth Amendment (the Sixth Amendment) to the Note Purchase Agreement. The First Amendment and the Sixth Amendment amend the respective definitions of EBITDA in the Private Shelf Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement to conform to the amended EBITDA definition contained in the Credit Agreement Amendment. Debt Covenant Compliance and Noteholders Consent The Company was in compliance with all covenant obligations under the aforementioned credit and note purchase agreements at December 31, 2013. In connection with its compliance with the covenant obligations as of December 31, 2012, the Company received a consent from its lender group to make a partial or complete withdrawal from the GCC/IBT National Pension Plan, and in connection with such withdrawal the Company recorded, as of December 31, 2012, a withdrawal liability with an estimated present value of $31.7 million. The lender group agreed to waive any event of default under the credit agreement that might occur as a result of such withdrawal and the incurrence of such withdrawal liability and acknowledged that the withdrawal liability incurred by the Company will not constitute indebtedness. See Note 20 Multiemployer Pension Plans for more information regarding the withdrawal liability. Other Debt Arrangements In July 2013, the Companys Belgium subsidiary entered into a financing arrangement for the purchase of production equipment in the amount of $0.1 million, with monthly payments over a three year period ending in June 2016. The balance outstanding at December 31, 2013 is $0.1 million, of which less than $0.1 million is included in Current portion of long term debt and $0.1 million is included in Long term debt. Management believes that the level of working capital is adequate for the Companys liquidity needs related to normal operations both currently and in the foreseeable future, and that the Company has sufficient resources to support its operations, either through currently available cash and cash generated from future operations, or pursuant to its current credit facility. The Companys ability to realize its near term business objectives is subject to, among other things, its ability to remain in compliance with its covenants under its debt arrangements. Based on its 2013 business plan, which contains a number of assumptions related to economic trends and the Companys business and operations, the Company presently expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants for the foreseeable future; however compliance in 2014 and thereafter remains subject to many variables, including those described under Risk Factors contained in this report. The Company operates in over 20 countries. The Company currently believes that there are no political, economic or currency restrictions that materially limit the Companys flexibility in managing its global cash resources. 40 Table of contents Seasonality The seasonal fluctuations in business generally result in lower revenues in the first quarter as compared to the other quarters of the year ended December 31. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Cash flows from its historically profitable operations have permitted the Company to re invest in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions of complementary businesses. Over the next five years, assuming no significant business acquisitions, routine capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $9.0 to $11.0 million annually. The Companys revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated in January 2012, expires in three years and all of its long term private placement debt matures over the next six years. The Companys total contractual obligations total approximately $140 million, including all debt obligations (see contractual obligation table below.) At this time, the Company believes that cash flow from operations and its continued ability to refinance its maturing debt obligations will be sufficient to finance the Company during the next five years, assuming no significant business acquisitions. If a significant acquisition is undertaken in the next five years, the Company would likely need to access the debt and equity markets to finance such an acquisition. The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt, lease and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the future periods: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Less More than 1 1 3 3 5 than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Year years years years Debt obligations $ 57,902 $ 1,266 $ 56 $ 31,580 $ 25,000 Interest on debt (1) 5,804 1,150 2,190 2,190 274 Operating lease obligations 41,157 12,709 16,224 7,769 4,455 Purchase obligations (2) 32,114 13,799 9,788 8,527 Deferred compensation 2,595 112 100 32 2,351 Uncertain tax positions (3) Total $ 139,572 $ 29,036 $ 28,358 $ 50,098 $ 32,080 (1) Reflects scheduled interest payments on fixed rate debt. Variable rate interest on approximately $31,580 of variable rate debt under its revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2013 is excluded because regular interest payments are not scheduled and fluctuate depending on outstanding principal balance and market rate interest levels. (2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments relating to software maintenance, software hosting, consulting fees, and other purchase commitments. (3) As of December 31, 2013, the Companys total liability for uncertain tax positions was $1,826, including $178 of accrued interest and penalties. It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that will change in the next twelve months attributable to the anticipated settlement of examinations or statute closures will be in the range of $750 to $1,700. Purchase obligations resulting from purchase orders entered in the normal course of business are not significant. The Companys major service cost is employees labor. The Company expects to fund future contractual obligations through funds generated from operations, together with general company financing transactions. Critical accounting policies and estimates The discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes that the following are the most critical accounting estimates that could have an effect on its reported results. 41 Table of contents Accounts Receivable. The Companys clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers, retailers and life science companies. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to the Company from its normal business activities. The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using assumptions of minimum reserve requirement percentages applied to the aging of the Companys trade accounts receivable, along with specific reserves for known collection issues. For example, the aging based portion of the Companys reserve is determined by applying a 25 percent reserve to amounts overdue by more than 120 days, a 60 percent reserve to amounts overdue by more than 180 days and a 100 percent reserve for amounts overdue by more than 365 days. In the Companys experience, this policy as supplemented by specific reserves for known collection issues, broadly captures the credit risk in its receivables. Based on the Companys estimates and assumptions, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2.0 million was recorded at December 31, 2013, compared to an allowance of $2.1 million at December 31, 2012. A change in the Companys assumptions would result in the Company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value. Any difference could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense. Impairment of Long Lived Assets. The Company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the consumer packaging industry, a loss of a major customer or several customers, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is used or an adverse change in the physical condition of an asset. The Company tests long lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances have changed and a potential impairment trigger is indicated. Impairment is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If this comparison indicates that an asset is impaired, the loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The Companys impairment losses in regard to long lived assets have in recent years primarily related to surplus properties resulting from restructuring (i.e., facility consolidation) actions and customer relationship intangible assets. For significant losses, the Company estimates fair value based on market valuation studies performed by qualified third party valuation experts. Assumptions used in estimating cash flows include among other things those assumptions concerning periods of operation and projections of revenues and costs of revenues, industry trends and market interest rates. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates used in assessing asset impairment and it is possible that impairment charges recognized in a given period would differ if the assessment was made in a different period. During 2013, the Company recorded $0.5 million for impairment of long lived assets related to customer relationship intangible assets at Company locations where projected cash flows did not support the carrying value of the assets. The expense is reflected as an Impairment of long lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) at December 31, 2013. A change in the Companys business climate in future periods, including a significant downturn in the Companys operations, could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, resulting in future additional impairment charges. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets. The Company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill, customer relationships and, to a lesser extent, other intangible assets. Goodwill is subject to an annual (or under certain circumstances more frequent) impairment test based on its estimated fair value. Other intangible assets, including customer relationships, are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances have changed and a potential impairment trigger is indicated. Events that may indicate potential impairment include a loss of, or a significant decrease in volume from, a major customer, a change in the expected useful life of an asset, a change in the market value of an asset, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, unanticipated competition relative to a major customer or the loss of key personnel relative to a major customer. Impairment is evaluated in a recoverability test including a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If this comparison indicates that an acquired intangible asset is impaired, the loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The Company performs a goodwill impairment test annually, or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company performs its annual impairment test as of October 1 each year. The Company performed its 2013 and 2012 goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and determined that no impairment of goodwill was indicated for either year. For both years, the Company performed its annual impairment review on a geographic basis at the operating segment level. The Company has determined that its operating segments are also its reporting units for goodwill testing. Using projection of operating cash flow for each reporting unit, the Company performed a step one assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach (i.e. discounted cash flow, or DCF), as compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit. In addition, the Company utilized a market approach, which assumes that companies operating in the same industry will share similar characteristics and the company values will correlate to those characteristics, to validate the results of the income approach valuations. However, due to lack of comparable industry data, the Company ultimately relied on the income approach in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units. The DCF method was used due to company specific growth and profitability factors best captured in managements projections, which are considered most representative of the future outlook for the reporting units. 42 Table of contents The step one impairment analysis for the October 1, 2013 test indicated no potential impairment of the assigned goodwill. The following table summarizes the results of the Companys step one impairment analysis as of October 1, 2013: (in millions) Americas Europe Asia Pacific Total Fair value of reporting unit $ 349.9 $ 56.9 $ 35.9 $ 442.7 Carrying value of reporting unit $ 206.8 $ 27.6 $ 12.0 $ 246.4 Percentage fair value over carrying value 69.2 % 106.3 % 197.8 % 79.6 % Goodwill allocated to reporting unit $ 181.9 $ 14.1 $ 7.8 $ 203.8 Based on the October 1, 2013 closing price of the Companys common stock, the Company had a market capitalization of $394.6 million, compared to its estimated fair value of $442.7 million, which indicates an implied control premium of approximately 12.2 percent. The discounted cash flow model used for the income valuation approach was based on the Companys ten year projections of operating income for each reporting unit. The Companys ten year projection assumes revenue growth of 3 to 4 percent annually, with a commensurate increase in operating expenses. The discount rates used for the cash flow model varied from 14 percent to 16 percent, by reporting unit. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. In making this assessment, the Companys management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows, including operating results, business plans and present value techniques. There are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows and managements judgment is required in applying these assumptions and estimates to the analysis of goodwill impairment, including projecting revenues and profits, interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, the corporations stock price and the allocation of shared or corporate items. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change from period to period. These changes may result in future impairments. For example, the Companys revenue growth rate could be lower than projected due to economic, industry or competitive factors or the discount rate used in the Companys cash flow model could increase due to a change in market interest rates. Additionally, future goodwill impairment charges may be necessary if the Companys market capitalization decreased due to a decline in the trading price of the Companys common stock. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized. Federal, state and foreign tax authorities regularly audit The Company, like other multi national companies, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company uses a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Actual outcomes could result in a change in reported income tax expense for a particular period. For example, the Companys effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries which have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries which have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting or other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. The Company is subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against it. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from its historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on the Companys operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. See Item 8, Note 12 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of contents The Company has provided valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, primarily arising from the acquisition of Seven in 2005, due to the dormancy of the companies generating the tax assets or due to income tax rules limiting the availability of the losses to offset future taxable income. During 2011, the Company released approximately $6.4 million of certain valuation allowances that were no longer needed, principally for certain of the Companys United Kingdom and Australian subsidiaries. Exit Reserves. The Company records reserves for the consolidation of workforce and facilities of acquired companies. The exit plans are approved by company management prior to, or shortly after, the acquisition date. The exit plans provide for severance pay, lease abandonment costs and other related expenses. A change in any of the assumptions used to estimate the exit reserves that result in a decrease to the reserve would result in a decrease to goodwill. Any change in assumptions that result in an increase to the exit reserves would result in a charge to income. Exit reserves are adjusted when facts regarding a particular reserve have changed, indicating that the original reserve assumptions are no longer valid. For example, the sublease assumptions originally used in computing a reserve for a vacant leased property could become invalid because of a change in circumstances of a sublease tenant, requiring a recalculation of the correct reserve balance. During 2013, the Company reached an agreement for an early termination of the remaining lease related to exit reserves for acquisitions completed in 2004 and 2005 and the remaining reserve balance was reversed. See Item 8, Note 2 Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Multiemployer Pension Plans. The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover its union represented employees. Management monitors financial exposure to the Company and the strength of participating plans under the Pension Protection Act Zone Status hierarchy. At the direction of the Companys Board of Directors, Management may enter into good faith bargaining to exit participating plans if a plan is severely underfunded. The Company records liabilities to exit a participating plan when an exit becomes both probable and estimable. Independent actuaries are engaged by the Company to estimate potential withdrawal liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a $31.7 million withdrawal liability, which was the then present value of the estimated future payments required for withdrawal discounted at a risk free rate. The liability is $32.5 million at December 31, 2013, due to accretion of the present value discount of $0.8 million during 2013. See Item 8, Note 20 Multiemployer Pension Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013 11, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in ASU 2013 11 provide guidance on the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The amendments in ASU 2013 11 are effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company will be adopting ASU 2013 11 effective January 1, 2014. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013 02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). The amendments in ASU 2013 02 supersede and replace the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in ASU 2011 05 and ASU 2011 12 for all public and private organizations. The amendments would require an entity to provide additional information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amendments in ASU 2013 02 are effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company adopted ASU 2013 02 effective January 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Impact of Inflation The Company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. 44 Table of contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Exposure The Company has $31.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 and expects to use its variable rate credit facilities during 2014 and beyond primarily for general corporate purposes, cash flow needs, and, to the extent opportunities arise, acquisitions and investments. The debt is variable to the Euro currency, Canadian and U.S. prime rates. Assuming interest rate volatility in the future is similar to what has been seen in recent years, the Company does not anticipate that short term changes in interest rates will materially affect its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. An adverse change of 10 percent in interest rates (from 2.3 percent at December 31, 2013 to 2.6 percent) would add approximately $0.1 million of interest cost annually based on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2013. The Companys $26.2 million in outstanding fixed rate debt at December 31, 2013 is fixed at rates that range from 4.38 percent to 8.98 percent. Foreign Exchange Exposure The Company is subject to changes in various foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys principal currency exposures relate to the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Malaysian Ringgit, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee and the Australian Dollar. The Companys 2013 results of operations were negatively affected by an increase in the average value of the U.S. dollar relative to most foreign currencies. An adverse change of 10 percent in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in sales of $15.0 million, or 3.4 percent, and a decrease in income before income taxes of $1.9 million, or 9.3 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company recorded pre tax foreign exchange losses of $1.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively. These losses were recorded by international subsidiaries primarily for currency exposure arising from intercompany debt obligations. These losses are included in Foreign exchange loss in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). In order to mitigate foreign exchange rate exposure, the Company entered into several forward contracts, designated as fair value hedges, during 2012. See Item 8, Note 19 Derivative Financial Instruments for more information. 45 Table of contents
