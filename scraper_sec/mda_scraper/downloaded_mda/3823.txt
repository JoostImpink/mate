Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements (the financial statements) included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Loral Space & Communications Inc. (New Loral) was formed to succeed to the business conducted by its predecessor registrant, Loral Space & Communications Ltd. (Old Loral), which emerged from reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 (Chapter 11) of title 11 the United States Code on November 21, 2005 (the Effective Date) pursuant to the terms of the fourth amended joint plan of reorganization of Old Loral and its debtor subsidiaries, as modified (the Plan of Reorganization). We adopted fresh start accounting as of October 1, 2005, in accordance with Statement of Position No. 90 7, Financial Reporting of Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code (SOP 90 7). Accordingly, our financial information disclosed under the heading Successor Registrant for the periods ended and as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is presented on a basis different from, and is therefore not comparable to, our financial information disclosed under the heading Predecessor Registrant for the period ended and as of October 1, 2005 (the date we adopted fresh start accounting) or for prior periods. The terms, Loral, the Company, we, our and us, when used in this report with respect to the period prior to our emergence from Chapter 11, are references to Old Loral, and when used with respect to the period commencing after our emergence, are references to New Loral. These references include the subsidiaries of Old Loral or New Loral, as the case may be, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. References to full year 2005 financial information throughout this discussion combine the periods of January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 with October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005. Management believes that providing this financial information is the most relevant and useful method for making comparisons. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical information contained in the following discussion and analysis, the matters discussed below are not historical facts, but are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we or our representatives have made and may continue to make forward looking statements, orally or in writing, in other contexts. These forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes, expects, plans, may, will, would, could, should, anticipates, estimates, project, intend, or outlook or other variations of these words. These statements, including without limitation, those relating New Telesat, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual events or results may differ materially as a result of a wide variety of factors and conditions, many of which are beyond our control. For a detailed discussion of these and other factors and conditions, please refer to the Commitments and Contingencies section below and to our other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We operate in an industry sector in which the value of securities may be volatile and may be influenced by economic and other factors beyond our control. We undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements. 33 Table of Contents Overview Businesses Loral is a leading satellite communications company organized into two operating segments: Satellite Manufacturing and Satellite Services. Satellite Manufacturing Our subsidiary, Space Systems/Loral, Inc. (SS/L), designs and manufactures satellites, space systems and space system components for commercial and government customers whose applications include fixed satellite services (FSS), direct to home (DTH) broadcasting, mobile satellite services (MSS), broadband data distribution, wireless telephony, digital radio, digital mobile broadcasting, military communications, weather monitoring and air traffic management. Satellite manufacturers have high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead. Based on its current cost structure, we estimate that SS/L covers its fixed costs, including depreciation and amortization, with an average of five to six satellite awards a year depending on the size, power, pricing and complexity of the satellite. Cash flow in the satellite manufacturing business tends to be uneven. It takes two to three years to complete a satellite project and numerous assumptions are built into the estimated costs. SS/Ls cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones that depend in part on the ability of its subcontractors to deliver on time. In addition, the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict, contributing to the unevenness of revenue and making it more challenging to align the workforce to the workflow. While its requirement for ongoing capital investment to maintain its current capacity is relatively low, SS/L estimates that facilities expansion to enable the booking of, on average, seven to nine satellite awards per year will require incremental capital expenditures of up to $150 million over the next three years and has initiated planning efforts to accomplish this. The satellite manufacturing industry is a knowledge intensive business, the success of which relies heavily on its technological heritage and the skills of its workforce. The breadth and depth of talent and experience resident in SS/Ls workforce of approximately 2,000 personnel, is one of our key competitive resources. Satellites are extraordinarily complex devices designed to operate in the very hostile environment of space. This complexity may lead to unanticipated costs during the design, manufacture and testing of a satellite. SS/L establishes provisions for costs based on historical experience and program complexity to cover anticipated costs. As most of SS/Ls contracts are fixed price, cost increases in excess of the provisions reduce profitability and may result in losses to SS/L, which may be material. The highly competitive satellite manufacturing industry has recently recovered from a several year period in the early part of this decade when order levels reached an unprecedented low level. Buyers, as a result, have had the advantage over suppliers in negotiating prices, terms and conditions resulting in reduced margins and increased assumptions of risk by SS/L. SS/L was further handicapped while it was in Chapter 11, because of buyers reluctance to purchase satellites from a company in bankruptcy. Satellite Services Our subsidiary, Loral Skynet Corporation (Loral Skynet), operates a global fixed satellite services business. Loral Skynet leases transponder capacity to commercial and governmental customers for video distribution and broadcasting, high speed data distribution, Internet access and communications, as well as provides managed network services to customers using a hybrid satellite and ground based system. Loral Skynet has four in orbit satellites and has one satellite under construction at SS/L. It also provides professional services to other satellite operators such as fleet operating services. While we compete with fiber optic cable and other terrestrial delivery systems, primarily for point to point applications, Loral Skynet has been able to combine the inherent advantages of each technology to provide its customers with complete end to end services. Since FSS satellites remain in a fixed point above the earths equator and can provide service to wide geographic regions, they provide inherent advantages over terrestrial systems for certain applications, such as broadcast or point to multipoint transmission of video and broadband data. A satellite offers instant infrastructure. It can cover large geographic areas, sometimes entire hemispheres, and can not only provide services to populated areas, but also can better serve areas with inadequate terrestrial infrastructures, low density populations or difficult geographic terrain. 34 Table of Contents The satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment. Once these investments are made, however, the costs to maintain and operate the fleet are relatively low. The upfront investments are earned back through the leasing of transponders to customers over the life of the satellite. Given the harsh and unpredictable environment in which the satellites operate, another major cost factor is in orbit insurance. Annual receipts from this business are fairly predictable because they are derived from an established base of long term customer contracts and high contract renewal rates. Competition in the satellite services market has historically been intense in recent years due to a number of factors, including transponder over capacity in certain geographic regions and increased competition from fiber. This competition puts pressure on prices, depending on market conditions in various geographic regions and frequency bands. A stronger economy and an increase in capital available for expanded consumer and enterprise level services have more recently led to an improvement in demand in certain markets. Much of Loral Skynets currently unleased capacity, however, is over geographic regions where the market is characterized by excess capacity, coupled with weak demand, or where regulatory obstacles are such that we find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage as compared to local operators. During 2006, Loral Skynet initiated steps to restructure its network services global operations, which is a component of the Satellite Services segment. The plan called for termination of certain operating leases and involuntary termination of certain employees and was completed in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we incurred $1.3 million of costs associated with this plan, of which $0.9 million was for employee termination costs and the remainder related to the write off of inventory and fixed assets. We do not expect to incur any additional costs associated with this plan. On December 16, 2006, a joint venture formed by Loral and its Canadian partner, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP) entered into a definitive agreement with BCE Inc. to acquire 100 percent of the stock of Telesat Canada and certain other assets from BCE Inc. for CAD 3.25 billion (approximately $2.79 billion based on exchange rate of $1.00/CAD 1.1652). In connection with the Telesat transaction, Loral will be responsible for funding certain cash requirements as well as, contributing substantially all of Loral Skynets assets to Telesat Canadas business in return for a 64% economic interest in the ultimate parent company of New Telesat, which will hold both Telesat Canada and the Loral Skynet assets. See Item 1. Business Recent Developments and the Telesat Canada Transaction below. On March 17, 2004, we consummated the sale of our North American satellites and related assets to certain affiliates of Intelsat, Ltd. and Intelsat (Bermuda), Ltd. (collectively, Intelsat). This transaction precluded Loral Skynet from providing lease capacity into North America for two years. Bankruptcy Reorganization During the years 2001 2003, the sustained and unprecedented decline in demand for our satellites and the transponder over capacity in our satellite services business exacerbated Old Lorals already strained financial condition brought on primarily by the investments we had previously made in Globalstar, L.P. (Globalstar) that we subsequently wrote off . Globalstar filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions under Chapter 11 in February 2002. On July 15, 2003, Old Loral and certain of its subsidiaries (the Debtor Subsidiaries and collectively with Old Loral, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11. During the ensuing two and a half year period we further increased our emphasis on cash conservation by reducing operating expenses and closely monitoring capital expenditures. On August 1, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court entered its confirmation order confirming the Plan of Reorganization. On September 30, 2005, the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC) approved the transfer of FCC licenses from Old Loral to New Loral, which represented satisfaction of the last material condition precedent to emergence. The Debtors emerged from their reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 on November 21, 2005 pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. Pursuant to SOP 90 7 we adopted fresh start accounting as of October 1, 2005 (see Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements). 35 Table of Contents Future Outlook We have reorganized around SS/Ls satellite manufacturing operations and Loral Skynets fleet of satellites. Following our emergence from Chapter 11, we have focused primarily on taking advantage of the years of experience and superior expertise of our professional senior management team to capture opportunities in our markets and maintain an efficient stream lined operation. Construction of Telstar 11N, a powerful new multi region Ku band communications satellite for Loral Skynet, has begun at SS/L and upon completion will be launched into the 37.55 W.L. orbital location. Scheduled to enter service in late 2008, Telstar 11N will provide commercial and governmental customers with broadband connectivity within and among the American, European and African regions. Our customers will also use Telstar 11N for video distribution and high speed data and voice services. This satellite will be transferred to New Telesat as part of the Skynet Transaction (as defined below). Upon closing of the Telesat acquisition and the Skynet Transaction, Loral will hold a 64% economic interest in the worlds fourth largest satellite operator with more than $5 billion of backlog. The integration of Loral Skynets and Telesat Canadas operations and the combined satellite fleet of this new Telesat Canada and Loral Skynet company, comprised of 11 in orbit and four satellites under construction, will offer customers expanded satellite and terrestrial coverage and continue to offer superior customer service. We believe that this transaction will allow New Telesat to compete more effectively in the FSS industry. (See Satellite Services Operations in Part 1, Item 1 for more information.) Critical success factors for both of our segments include maintaining our reputation for reliability, quality and superior customer service. These factors are vital to securing new customers and retaining current ones. At the same time, we must continue to contain costs and maximize efficiencies. Loral Skynet is focused on planning the integration of Loral Skynets and Telesat Canadas operations and identifying opportunities for cost reductions while managing Loral Skynets on going operations. SS/L is focused on increasing bookings and backlog, while maintaining the cost efficiencies and process improvements realized over the past several years. In addition, SS/L must continue to align its direct workforce with the level of awards. In order to complete construction of all the satellites in backlog and to accommodate long term growth, SS/L will need, and is in the process of hiring additional staff. Long term growth at SS/L will also require expanded facilities, and working capital requirements, primarily for the orbital component of the satellite contract which is payable to SS/L over the life of the satellite. We regularly explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions and alliances. We also periodically engage in discussions with satellite service providers, satellite manufacturers and others regarding such matters, which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets. In order to pursue certain of these opportunities, we would require additional funds. There can be no assurance that we will enter into any strategic transactions or alliances and, if so, on what terms or that we will be able to obtain such financing or favorable terms, if at all. On February 27, 2007, Loral completed a $300 million preferred stock financing pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement entered into with MHR Fund Management LLC (MHR) on October 17, 2006. Loral plans to use the proceeds from this financing, together with its existing resources, to pursue both internal and external growth opportunities in the satellite communications industry and strategic transactions or alliances, including completion of the Telesat acquisition (see Notes 19 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements). See Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a complete description of Lorals businesses. Consolidated Operating Results Please refer to Critical Accounting Matters set forth below in this section. The following discussion of revenues and Adjusted EBITDA reflects the results of our operating business segments for 2006, 2005 and 2004. The balance of the discussion relates to our consolidated results, unless otherwise noted. As previously discussed, we emerged from Chapter 11 on November 21, 2005 and adopted fresh start accounting as of October 1, 2005. As a result of the adoption of fresh start accounting, the Successor Registrants financial statements are not comparable with the Predecessor Registrants financial statements. 36 Table of Contents References to full year 2005 financial information throughout this discussion combine the periods of January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 with October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005. Management believes that presenting the financial information in this way is the most relevant and useful method for making comparisons. The common definition of EBITDA is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. In evaluating financial performance, we use revenues and operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including amortization of stock based compensation) and reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy (Adjusted EBITDA) as the measure of a segments profit or loss. Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to the common definition of EBITDA before: reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy; gain on discharge of pre petition obligations and fresh start adjustments; gain (loss) on investments; other income (expense); equity in net income (losses) of affiliates; and minority interest, net of tax. Adjusted EBITDA allows us and investors to compare our operating results with that of competitors exclusive of depreciation and amortization, interest and investment income, interest expense, reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy, other income (expense), net losses of affiliates and minority interest. Financial results of competitors in our industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures, the amount of intangible assets recorded, the differences in assets lives, the timing and amount of investments, the effects of other income (expense), which are typically for non recurring transactions not related to the on going business, and effects of investments not directly managed. The use of Adjusted EBITDA allows us and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items. Competitors in our industry have significantly different capital structures. The use of Adjusted EBITDA maintains comparability of performance by excluding interest expense. In addition, during Chapter 11, we recognized interest expense only on the actual interest payments we made. During this period, we did not make any further interest payments on our debt obligations after March 17, 2004, the date we repaid our secured bank debt. Reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy were only incurred during the period we were in Chapter 11. These expenses have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA to maintain comparability with our results during periods in which we were not in Chapter 11 and with the results of competitors using similar measures. We believe the use of Adjusted EBITDA along with U.S. GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and investors in comparing performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDA as used here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by competitors. We also use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance of our segments, to allocate resources and capital to such segments, to measure performance for incentive compensation programs and to evaluate future growth opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA should be used in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures and is not presented as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance. The sale of our North American satellites and related assets to Intelsat in March 2004 has been accounted for as a discontinued operation, resulting in our historical statements of operations and statements of cash flows reflecting such discontinued operations separately from continuing operations (see Note 5 to the financial statements). 37 Table of Contents Revenues: For the Period For the Period October 2, January 1, Year Ended 2005 to 2005 to Year Ended December 31, December 31, October 1, December 31, 2006 2005 (a) 2005 2005 2004 (in millions) Satellite Manufacturing $ 696.5 $ 491.3 $ 161.8 $ 329.5 $ 436.6 Satellite Services 163.8 151.5 37.0 114.5 141.2 Revenues from sales type lease arrangement 87.2 Segment revenues 860.3 642.8 198.8 444.0 665.0 Eliminations(1) (63.0 ) (16.4 ) (1.6 ) (14.8 ) (142.9 ) Revenues as reported(2) $ 797.3 $ 626.4 $ 197.2 $ 429.2 $ 522.1 Adjusted EBITDA: For the Period For the Period October 2, January 1, Year Ended 2005 to 2005 to Year Ended December 31, December 31, October 1, December 31, 2006 2005 (a) 2005 2005 2004 (in millions) Satellite Manufacturing(3) $ 65.9 $ 27.0 $ 11.8 $ 15.2 $ (13.5 ) Satellite Services(4) 68.0 51.3 11.5 39.8 15.6 Satellite Services sales type lease arrangement 7.7 Corporate expenses(5) (26.8 ) (28.3 ) (11.0 ) (17.3 ) (34.9 ) Segment Adjusted EBITDA before eliminations 107.1 50.0 12.3 37.7 (25.1 ) Eliminations(1) (6.0 ) (13.5 ) (1.2 ) (12.3 ) (24.0 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 101.1 $ 36.5 $ 11.1 $ 25.4 $ (49.1 ) 38 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net (Loss) Income: For the Period For the Period October 2, January 1, Year Ended 2005 to 2005 to Year Ended December 31, December 31, October 1, December 31, 2006 2005 (a) 2005 2005 2004 (in millions) Adjusted EBITDA $ 101.1 $ 36.5 $ 11.1 $ 25.4 $ (49.1 ) Depreciation and amortization(6) (71.3 ) (77.3 ) (16.0 ) (61.3 ) (134.8 ) Reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy (31.2 ) (31.2 ) (30.4 ) Operating income (loss) from continuing operations 29.8 (72.0 ) (4.9 ) (67.1 ) (214.3 ) Gain on discharge of pre petition obligations and fresh start adjustments(7) 1,101.5 1,101.5 Interest and investment income 31.5 10.5 4.1 6.4 9.9 Interest expense (23.4 ) (21.6 ) (4.4 ) (17.2 ) (2.9 ) Other expense (7.8 ) (1.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.9 ) (0.5 ) Income tax (provision) benefit (20.8 ) 9.1 (1.8 ) 10.9 (13.2 ) Equity (losses) income in affiliates (7.2 ) (8.2 ) (5.4 ) (2.8 ) 46.6 Minority interest (24.8 ) (2.6 ) (2.7 ) 0.1 0.1 (Loss) income from continuing operations (22.7 ) 1,015.6 (15.3 ) 1,030.9 (174.3 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes 14.0 14.0 (2.4 ) Net (loss) income $ (22.7 ) $ 1,029.6 $ (15.3 ) $ 1,044.9 $ (176.7 ) (a) The combination of the period January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 and the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005 represents non GAAP financial information. Management believes that presenting the financial information in this way is the most relevant and useful method for making comparisons. (1) Represents the elimination of intercompany sales and intercompany Adjusted EBITDA, primarily for satellites under construction by SS/L for wholly owned subsidiaries. (2) Includes revenues from affiliates of $11.3 million, $4.1 million, $10.0 million, and $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, for the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005, the period January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively. (3) Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (a) 2004 (in millions) Satellite Manufacturing includes: Adjusted EBITDA before specific identified charges $ 56.8 $ 47.9 $ 10.8 Transponder rights provided to SS/L in the Satmex Settlement Agreement 19.0 Accrued warranty obligations (8.2 ) (17.3 ) (9.7 ) Write off of long term receivables due to contract modifications (11.3 ) Provisions for inventory obsolescence (1.7 ) (3.6 ) (3.3 ) Satellite Manufacturing segment Adjusted EBITDA before eliminations $ 65.9 $ 27.0 $ (13.5 ) 39 Table of Contents Satellite Manufacturing EBITDA excludes charges of $24 million for 2004, as a result of the settlement of all orbital receivables on satellites sold to Intelsat. This settlement had the effect of reducing future orbital receipts by $25 million, including $15 million relating to a satellite under construction in 2004. Consistent with our internal reporting for satellite manufacturing, this decrease in contract value for the satellite under construction was not reflected as a decrease in 2004 satellite manufacturing revenues. These charges had no effect on our consolidated results in 2004. (4) Satellite Services Revenue and EBITDA include $14.9 million resulting from receipt of a customer termination payment for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Satellite Services recognized $7.7 million of EBITDA for a sales type lease arrangement for satellite capacity and an impairment charge of $12.0 million relating to our Telstar 14/Estrela do Sul 1 satellite and related assets to reduce the carrying values to the expected proceeds from insurance. (5) Represents corporate expenses incurred in support of our operations and for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005 includes $1.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of continuing expenses for bankruptcy related matters, which after the adoption of fresh start accounting are classified as corporate general and administrative expenses. (6) Includes additional depreciation expense of $9 million for 2004, due to reducing the estimated life of our Telstar 11 satellite from March 2005 to June 2004. Also includes amortization of unearned stock compensation charges. (7) In connection with our emergence from Chapter 11 and our adoption of fresh start accounting on October 1, 2005, we recognized a gain on discharge of pre petition obligations and fresh start adjustments of $1.101 billion, related interest expense of $13.2 million and a tax benefit of $15.4 million, each of which is reflected separately in our statement of operations (see Note 4 to the financial statements). 2006 Compared with 2005 and 2005 Compared with 2004 (a) (a) The combination of the period January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 and the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005 represents non GAAP financial information.

Revenues from Satellite Manufacturing % Increase (Decrease) Year Ended 2006 2005 December 31, vs. vs. 2006 2005 (a) 2004 2005 2004 (in millions) Revenues from Satellite Manufacturing $ 697 $ 491 $ 437 42 % 13 % Eliminations (60 ) (11 ) (137 ) 412 % 91 % Revenues from Satellite Manufacturing as reported $ 637 $ 480 $ 300 33 % 61 % Revenues from Satellite Manufacturing before eliminations increased by $206 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Revenues in 2006 include $280 million of revenues from new satellite awards of $1 billion in 2006 and $417 million of revenues from awards in backlog at the beginning of the year. Revenues in 2005 include $165 million of revenues from new satellite awards of $824 million in 2005 and $326 million of revenues from awards in backlog at the beginning of the year. Eliminations consist primarily of revenues from satellites under construction by SS/L for Satellite Services. As a result, revenues from Satellite Manufacturing as reported increased $157 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Revenues from Satellite Manufacturing before eliminations increased by $54 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Revenues in 2005 include $165 million of revenues from new satellite awards of $824 million in 2005 and $326 million of revenues from existing backlog. at the beginning of the year. Revenues in 2004 include $57 million of revenues from new satellite awards of $385 million in 2004 and $380 million of revenues from awards in backlog at the beginning of the year. Eliminations consist primarily of revenues from satellites under construction by SS/L 40 Table of Contents for Satellite Services, and in 2004 include satellites under construction which have been completed. As a result, revenues from Satellite Manufacturing as reported increased $180 million in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Revenues also decreased $2 million due to the sale of our business television service and an international gateway. Revenues from Satellite Services as reported increased as a result of the receipt of a customer termination payment of $15 million in connection with the termination of services on our Estrela do Sul satellite (see Note 19 to the financial statements), partially offset by revenue associated with a payment made by a cash basis customer of $5 million in 2005. Eliminations primarily consist of revenues from leasing transponder capacity to Satellite Manufacturing. As a result, Revenues from Satellite Services as reported increased $14 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Revenues from Satellite Services before revenues from sales type lease arrangements and eliminations increased $11 million in 2005 compared to 2004, driven by a number of factors: $6 million in increased volume from Telstar 18 which was in service for all of 2005 versus only four months of 2004, a $6 million increase in revenues from higher utilization on the other satellites in our fleet, plus $5 million for revenues associated with a payment made by a cash basis customer. Offsetting these contributions was a $6 million decrease in revenues from Intelsat in connection with the discontinued operations of the North American fleet. In 2004, we recognized $87 million of revenues from a sales type lease arrangement for satellite capacity (see Note 8 to the financial statements). Eliminations primarily consist of revenues from leasing transponder capacity to Satellite Manufacturing. As a result, revenues for Satellite Services as reported decreased $76 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. 41 Table of Contents Cost of Satellite Manufacturing % Increase (Decrease) Year Ended 2006 2005 December 31, vs. vs. 2006 2005 (a) 2004 2005 2004 (in millions) Cost of Satellite Manufacturing includes: Cost of Satellite Manufacturing before specific identified charges $ 537 $ 394 $ 273 36 % 46 % Depreciation and amortization 23 15 23 55 % (34 )% Transponder rights provided to SS/L in the Satmex Settlement Agreement (19 ) Accrued warranty obligations 8 17 8 (53 )% 50 % Write off of long term receivables due to contract modifications 11 Provisions for inventory obsolescence 2 4 3 (54 )% 10 % Cost of Satellite Manufacturing $ 551 $ 430 $ 318 28 % 36 % Cost of Satellite Manufacturing as a % of Satellite Manufacturing revenues as reported 87 % 90 % 106 % Cost of Satellite Manufacturing was $551 million and $430 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cost of Satellite Manufacturing increased $121 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The Cost of Satellite Manufacturing before specific identified charges increased $143 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to the increase in sales and the related cost of new satellites under construction. The Cost of Satellite Manufacturing also increased as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense of $8 million primarily resulting from the net effect of the amortization of fair value adjustments in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting on October 1, 2005, offset by $19 million related to transponder rights provided to SS/L in the Satmex Settlement Agreement (see Note 9 to the financial statements) and a warranty expense accrual of $8 million recorded in 2006 as compared with $17 million in 2005, based upon an analysis of the status of satellites in orbit. As a result of the implementation of fresh start accounting on October 1, 2005, depreciation and amortization expense on fixed assets increased by approximately $5 million and amortization of intangible assets increased by approximately $3 million. Cost of Satellite Manufacturing was $139 million and $291 million for the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005 and the period January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005, respectively, totaling $430 million for 2005. Cost of Satellite Manufacturing increased $112 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. The Cost of Satellite Manufacturing before specific identified charges increased $121 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to the increase in sales for the period and a warranty expense accrual of $17 million recorded in 2005 as compared with $8 million in 2004, based upon an analysis of the status of satellites in orbit, partially offset by the effect of improved factory performance. The Cost of Satellite Manufacturing increase was also offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense of $8 million primarily resulting from the effects of reduced capital spending and the adoption of fresh start accounting on October 1, 2005. Depreciation and amortization for the Successor Registrant includes a $5 million credit due to amortization of contract valuation adjustments, partially offset by a $3 million amortization charge for intangibles established in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting. 42 Table of Contents Cost of Satellite Services % Increase (Decrease) Year Ended 2006 2005 December 31, vs. vs. 2006 2005 (a) 2004 2005 2004 (in millions) Cost of Satellite Services includes: Cost of Satellite Services before specific identified charges $ 53 $ 59 $ 65 (10 )% (10 )% Depreciation and amortization 46 61 112 (25 )% (44 )% Impairment charge for Telstar 14/Estrela do Sul 1 satellite 12 Cost of sales type lease arrangement 80 Cost of Satellite Services $ 99 $ 120 $ 269 (18 )% (55 )% Cost of Satellite Services as a % of Satellite Services revenues as reported 62 % 82 % 121 % Cost of Satellite Services was $99 million and $120 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cost of Satellite Services before specific identified charges decreased $6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to ground segment support costs declining by $4 million, lower employee related expenses of $2 million and lower insurance premiums on our satellite fleet and lower third party capacity costs totaling $2 million. These decreases were partially offset by a charge of $1 million related to the buyout of a customer lease (see Notes 19 and 20 to the financial statements) and a charge of $1 million related to the restructuring of network services global operations. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $15 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily resulting from the net effect of the fair value adjustments in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting on October 1, 2005. Depreciation and amortization for 2006 includes reduced charges of depreciation and amortization of $12 million for fixed assets and a $3 million credit for amortization of intangibles primarily resulting from the adoption of fresh start accounting. Cost of Satellite Services was $26 million and $94 million for the periods October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005, respectively, totaling $120 million for 2005. Cost of Satellite Services before specific identified charges decreased $6 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily because external satellite capacity costs declined $7 million and payroll and other costs declined $4 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in satellite insurance expense of $3 million due to higher premiums and higher ground operations costs of $2 million. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $51 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily resulting from a reduction of $42 million related to our Telstar 11 satellite which was fully depreciated as of December 31, 2004 and the net effect of the fair value adjustments in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting on October 1, 2005. Depreciation and amortization for 2005 includes reduced charges of depreciation and amortization of $7 million for fixed assets and a $1 million credit for amortization of intangibles primarily resulting from the adoption of fresh start accounting. In 2004, we incurred $80 million of costs for a sales type lease arrangement and recognized an impairment charge of $12 million for the Telstar 14/Estrela do Sul 1 satellite and related assets to reduce the carrying values to the expected proceeds from insurance of $250 million (see Note 8 to the financial statements). As a result, cost of Satellite Services decreased $149 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. 43 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses % Increase (Decrease) Year Ended 2006 2005 December 31, vs. vs. 2006 2005 (a) 2004 2005 2004 (in millions) Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 126 $ 112 $ 119 12 % (2 )% Continuing expenses for bankruptcy related matters 1 4 (70 )% % Selling, general and administrative expenses as reported $ 127 $ 116 $ 119 % of revenues as reported 16 % 19 % 23 % Selling, general and administrative expenses as reported were $127 million and $116 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses before continuing expenses for bankruptcy related matters increased by $14 million as compared to 2005, primarily due to: increased SS/L costs of $8 million for research and development and $2 million for rent as a result of the increased volume, partially offset by lower bid and proposal costs of $2 million; increased costs at Satellite Services for bad debt expense of $2 million, primarily because of recoveries of $2 million in 2005 and $2 million of severance costs; and higher Corporate expenses (before continuing expenses for bankruptcy related matters) of $1 million, primarily related to higher litigation costs of $2 million. Continuing expenses for bankruptcy related matters decreased $3 million as a result of a $3 million reimbursement related to the settlement of professional fees previously paid. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $37 million and $79 million for the periods October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 respectively, totaling $116 million for 2005. The decrease of $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005 as compared to 2004, was primarily due to lower headcount and employee related expenses and other cost reductions at Satellite Services of $7 million and lower corporate expenses of $2 million, partially offset by higher Satellite Manufacturing bid and proposal costs of $4 million and the inclusion of $4 million of continuing expenses for bankruptcy related matters in General and Administrative expenses after the adoption of fresh start accounting. Gain on Litigation Settlement Represents a $9 million recovery of launch vehicle deposits in connection with a claim against a supplier for the wrongful termination of launch service agreements (see Note 19 to the financial statements). Reorganization Expenses Due to Bankruptcy % Increase (Decrease) Year Ended 2006 2005 December 31, vs. vs. 2006 2005 (a) 2004 2005 2004 (in millions) Reorganization Expenses Due to Bankruptcy $ $ 31 $ 30 % 3 % Reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy decreased $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of the adoption of fresh start accounting on October 1, 2005. After the adoption of fresh start accounting, continuing expenses related to the remaining bankruptcy matters are recorded in general and administrative expenses. Reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy increased $1 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily as a result of higher professional fees of $11 million which was mostly due to professional fees associated with the Equity Committee that was appointed by the United States Trustee for the Southern District of New York on March 29, 2005 and extensive legal fees associated with the confirmation hearings and vendor settlement gains of $6 million recorded in 2004. These increases were partially offset by lower 2005 employee retention costs of $11 million and lower severance costs of $4 million. After the adoption of fresh start accounting on October 1, 44 Table of Contents 2005, continuing expenses for bankruptcy related matters are recorded in General and Administrative expenses (see Note 13 to the financial statements). Gain on Discharge of Pre petition Obligations and Fresh start Adjustments As a result of our emergence from Chapter 11 and adopting fresh start accounting, we recognized a gain of $1.101 billion, excluding interest expense of $13 million and a tax benefit of $15 million, in 2005 (see Note 4 to the financial statements). Interest and Investment Income Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (a) 2004 (in millions) Interest and investment income $ 32 $ 11 $ 10 The interest income increase of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005, is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher short term interest rates in 2006 over 2005. This includes increases of $13 million due to higher cash balances and short term interest rates and an increase of $8 million primarily due to the partial sale of our holdings in Globalstar. These increases were partially offset by lower SS/L interest income on vendor financing and orbital incentives of $1 million. Interest income in 2005 and 2004 was primarily derived from our orbital incentives on satellites in orbit manufactured by SS/L. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (a) 2004 (in millions) Interest cost before capitalized interest $ 26 $ 9 $ 4 Interest expense in connection with our Plan of Reorganization 13 Capitalized interest (3 ) (1 ) Interest expense $ 23 $ 22 $ 3 Interest cost before capitalized interest increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to $14 million of increased interest expense recognized on the Loral Skynet 14% senior secured notes issued in connection with our Plan of Reorganization and a Satellite Manufacturing interest accrual of $4 million related to warranty obligations. In 2005, we incurred $13 million of interest expense relating to payments to pre petition creditors in connection with our Plan of Reorganization. Capitalized interest increased to $3 million due to higher construction in process balances. Interest cost before capitalized interest increased $5 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to $3 million of interest expense recognized on the Loral Skynet 14% senior secured notes issued in connection with our Plan of Reorganization. In 2005, we incurred $13 million of interest expense relating to payments to pre petition creditors in accordance with our Plan of Reorganization. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) in 2006, primarily represents unrealized losses of $6 million on derivative contracts entered into in connection with the anticipated acquisition of Telesat Canada (see Note 18 to the financial statements) and the write off of an investment of $3 million. 45 Table of Contents Income Tax (Provision) Benefit During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we continued to maintain the 100% valuation allowance that had been established at December 31, 2002 against our net deferred tax assets. However, upon emergence from bankruptcy in 2005, we reversed our valuation allowance relating to $2.0 million of deferred tax assets for AMT credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2006, we had valuation allowances totaling $304.9 million, which included a balance of $304.5 million relating to Old Loral periods preceding our adoption of fresh start accounting on October 1, 2005. We will continue to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. If, in the future, we were to determine that we will be able to realize all or a portion of the benefit from our deferred tax assets, any reduction to the valuation allowance existing as of October 1, 2005 will first reduce goodwill, then other intangible assets with any excess treated as an increase to paid in capital. During 2006, we utilized the benefits from $10.4 million of deferred tax assets from Old Loral to reduce our current cash tax liability. The realization of this benefit created an excess valuation allowance of $10.4 million that was reversed as a reduction to goodwill. Also during 2006, we recorded a deferred tax provision of $26.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which created an excess valuation allowance of $26.0 million that was reversed as a reduction to goodwill. To the extent this adjustment related to unrealized gains on available for sale securities, which for 2006 the amount was $6.4 million, when such securities are ultimately disposed in a future period, we may be required to increase our income tax provision in the statement of operations in such future period by a portion of such adjustment. Our income tax provision and benefit can be summarized as follows: (i) for 2006, we recorded a current tax provision of $11.7 million and a deferred tax provision of $9.1 million, resulting in a total provision of $20.8 million on pre tax income of $30 million; (ii) for 2005, we recorded a current tax provision of $7.0 million and a deferred tax benefit of $16.1 million, resulting in a net benefit of $9.1 million on pre tax income of $1.017 billion, which included a gain on discharge of pre petition obligations and fresh start adjustments of $1.101 billion; and (iii) for 2004, we recorded a current tax provision of $1.1 million and a deferred tax provision of $12.2 million, resulting in a total provision of $13.3 million on a pre tax loss of $208 million. The increase to our current provision for 2006 as compared to 2005 and 2004 was primarily attributable to additional foreign income taxes, primarily Brazil on our lease income and a customer termination payment received in 2006 on our Estrela do Sul 1 satellite (see Note 8 to the financial statements), accruals of tax contingency liabilities for potential audit issues and federal and state AMT liabilities expected to be imposed on our taxable income for 2006. The deferred income tax provision for 2006 of $9.1 million related to (i) a provision of $10.4 million on current year income to the extent the taxes imposed on such income were reduced by deferred tax benefits from Old Loral and, as discussed above, the utilization of these deferred tax benefits created an excess valuation allowance that was reversed as a reduction to goodwill, (ii) offset by a benefit of $1.3 million for the increase to our deferred tax asset for additional federal and state AMT credits. For 2005, in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, Old Loral realized cancellation of debt income (COD) on its federal income tax return of approximately $440 million. COD realized while in bankruptcy is excluded from federal taxable income. We were required to reduce certain of our tax attributes, and to the extent sufficient attributes were not available on a separate company basis, reduce the tax basis in our assets, by an amount equal to the COD excluded by Old Loral from its taxable income. This adjustment resulted in a reduction of approximately $160 million to our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance. Also, as part of our fresh start accounting and plan of reorganization adjustments, we recognized a net income tax benefit of $15.4 million, which includes a net deferred tax benefit of $16.5 million. See Notes 4 and 14 to the financial statements. For 2004, the deferred income tax provision of $12.1 million related to an additional valuation allowance which was required when we reversed the following deferred tax liabilities from accumulated other comprehensive loss: (i) with the dissolution of Globalstar on June 29, 2004, we wrote off the remaining book value of our investment in Globalstars $500 million credit facility and reduced to zero the unrealized gains and related deferred tax liabilities previously reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The reversal of this deferred tax liability resulted in a net deferred tax asset of $11.4 million against which we recorded a full valuation allowance. 46 Table of Contents (ii) we also reduced the balance for certain deferred gains on derivative transactions and the related deferred tax liability included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The reversal of this deferred tax liability also resulted in a net deferred tax asset of $0.7 million against which we recorded a full valuation allowance. See Note 6 to the financial statements. Equity Income (Losses) in Affiliates Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (a) 2004 (in millions) XTAR $ (7.4 ) $ (8.1 ) $ 0.1 Other 0.2 (0.1 ) 46.5 $ (7.2 ) $ (8.2 ) $ 46.6 The decrease in equity losses in XTAR in 2006 represents our share of XTAR losses incurred in connection with its full year of operations. XTAR commenced commercial operations in 2005 with the launch of its satellite in February 2005. The increase in equity losses in XTAR in 2005 represents our share of higher XTAR losses incurred in connection with its start up, as well as the elimination of profit related to the construction of the Spainsat satellite by SS/L for Hisdesat, which was successfully launched on March 11, 2006. In connection with Globalstar, L.P.s dissolution in June 2004, we recorded equity income of $46.5 million relating to Globalstar, L.P. on the reversal of vendor financing that was non recourse to SS/L in the event of non payment by Globalstar, L.P. Minority Interest The Loral Skynet Preferred Stock is reflected as minority interest on our consolidated balance sheet and dividend expense of $24.8 million and $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and for the period October 2 to December 31, 2005, respectively, is reflected as minority interest on our consolidated statement of operations. Minority interest increased $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005, as a result of a full year of dividend expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 dividend expense from November 21, 2005 for the Loral Skynet Series A preferred stock issued in connection with our Plan of Reorganization (see Note 3 to the financial statements). Minority interest increased in 2005 as compared with 2004, as a result of the $3 million dividend accrual for the Loral Skynet Series A preferred stock issued in connection with our Plan of Reorganization (see Note 15 to the financial statements). Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations represents the revenues and expenses of the North American satellites and related assets sold to Intelsat on March 17, 2004 and includes a portion of interest expense on our secured bank debt through March 18, 2004 (see Interest Expense above). As a result of the resolution of contingencies, primarily relating to the completion of the Intelsat Americas 8 (Telstar 8) satellite, we have recognized in our 2005 statement of operations the previously deferred gain on the sale of $14 million, net of taxes of $2 million. In 2004, the results of the discontinued operations are for the period from January 1, 2004 to March 17, 2004, the date of the sale and includes the write off of approximately $11 million of debt issue costs to interest expense relating to our secured debt that was repaid and $9 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2004 from the settlement of an insurance claim for a satellite that was sold. For the purpose of this presentation, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), all indirect costs normally associated with these operations are included in continuing operations. These indirect costs include telemetry, tracking and control, access control, maintenance and engineering, selling and marketing and general and administrative (see Note 5 to the financial statements). 47 Table of Contents Backlog Backlog as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, was as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 Satellite Manufacturing $ 1,118 $ 815 Satellite Services 355 453 Total backlog before eliminations 1,473 1,268 Satellite Manufacturing eliminations (116 ) Satellite Services eliminations (10 ) (20 ) Total backlog $ 1,347 $ 1,248 Critical Accounting Matters The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the period. Actual results could differ from estimates. Fresh Start Accounting In connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start accounting as of October 1, 2005, which required all of our assets and liabilities to be stated at estimated fair value. We engaged an independent appraisal firm to assist in determining such fair values (see Note 4 to the financial statements). Significant judgment was exercised by management in estimating the fair values. Revenue recognition Most of our Satellite Manufacturing revenue is associated with long term fixed price contracts. Revenue and profit from satellite sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method, which requires significant estimates. We use this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates include forecasts of costs and schedules, estimating contract revenue related to contract performance (including estimated amounts for penalties, performance incentives and orbital incentives that will be received as the satellite performs on orbit) and the potential for component obsolescence in connection with long term procurements. These estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known. Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract at completion. Under firm fixed price contracts, work performed and products shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract; accordingly, favorable changes in estimates in a period will result in additional revenue and profit, and unfavorable changes in estimates will result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that will be borne solely by us. Depreciation Depreciation is provided for on the straight line method for satellites over the estimated useful life of the satellite, which is determined by engineering analyses performed at the satellites in service date and re evaluated periodically. A decrease in the useful life of a satellite would result in increased depreciation expense. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $305.2 million of cash, short term investments and restricted cash, of which $106.6 million is in the form of short term investments and $12 million is in the form of restricted cash ($3 million included in other current assets and $9 million included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet). Short term investments consist of investments whose maturity at time of purchase was 48 Table of Contents greater than 90 days and less than one year or investments which had been long term whose final maturity is less than one year from December 31. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and at each balance sheet date. Our short term investments include corporate bonds, Euro dollar bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, Federal Agency notes and auction rate securities. Auction rate securities, long term obligations that are sold and purchased through an auction process for a period of 7, 28, 35 or 49 days, are considered to be short term investments and are classified as available for sale securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, if any, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Billed receivables, vendor financing and long term receivables We are required to estimate the collectibility of our billed receivables, vendor financing and long term receivables. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances. Charges for (recoveries of) bad debts recorded to the income statement on billed receivables for the year ended December 31, 2006, the periods October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2004, were $0.3 million, $1.0 million, $(2.9) million, and $(2.1) million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, billed receivables were net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $1.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively. We evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are re evaluated periodically. Inventories Inventories are reviewed for estimated obsolescence or unusable items and, if appropriate, are written down to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project, additional inventory write downs may be required. These are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory. Charges for inventory obsolescence recorded to the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2006, the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005, the period January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1.7 million, $1.5 million, $2.1 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. Evaluation of Satellites and Other Long Lived Assets For Impairment We periodically evaluate our satellites and other long lived assets for potential impairment losses, when a change in circumstances occurs, by assessing whether the carrying amount of these assets can be recovered over their remaining lives through future undiscounted expected cash flows generated by those assets (excluding financing costs). If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset, an impairment charge would be recorded based on such assets estimated fair value. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Estimated future cash flows could be impacted by, among other things: Changes in estimates of the useful life of the satellite Changes in estimates of our ability to operate the satellite at expected levels Changes in the manner in which the satellite is to be used The loss of one or several significant customer contracts on the satellite If an impairment loss was indicated for a satellite, such amount would be recognized in the period of occurrence, net of any insurance proceeds to be received so long as such amounts are determinable and receipt is probable. If no impairment loss was indicated in accordance with SFAS 144, and we received insurance proceeds, the proceeds would be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations. 49 Table of Contents Taxation New Loral, as a Delaware company, is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxation on its worldwide income. Prior to the Effective Date, Old Loral, as a Bermuda company, was subject to U.S. taxation on any income that was effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business as well as a withholding tax on dividends and interest received from its U.S. subsidiaries. Our U.S. subsidiaries continue to be subject to U.S. taxation on their worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the United States. Our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions. We use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements. Deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse. We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and, based upon this analysis, record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria in SFAS 109. Based upon this analysis, we concluded during the fourth quarter of 2002 that, due to insufficient positive evidence substantiating recoverability, a 100% valuation allowance should be established for our net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2006, we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $536.9 million, which when offset by our deferred tax liabilities of $243.6 million and our valuation allowance of $304.9 million, resulted in a net deferred tax liability of $11.6 million on our consolidated balance sheet. For 2006, we continued to maintain the 100% valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, other than the $3.3 million asset for our AMT credit carryforwards, decreasing the valuation allowance at December 31, 2005 of $337.3 million by $32.4 million to a balance of $304.9 million at December 31, 2006, which included $304.5 million relating to the opening balance at October 1, 2005. We will maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. If, in the future, we were to determine that we will be able to realize all or a portion of the benefit from our deferred tax assets, any reduction to the valuation allowance as of October 1, 2005 will first reduce goodwill, then other intangible assets with any excess treated as an increase to paid in capital. During 2006, we reversed $36.4 million of excess valuation allowance relating to the balance as of October 1, 2005, which was recorded as a reduction to goodwill. Our policy is to establish tax contingency liabilities for potential audit issues. The tax contingency liabilities are based on our estimate of the probable amount of additional taxes that may be due in the future. Any additional taxes due would be determined only upon completion of current and future federal, state and international tax audits. At December 31, 2006, we had $42.6 million of tax contingency liabilities included in long term liabilities. At December 31, 2005, we had $41.8 million and $0.4 million of tax contingency liabilities included in long term liabilities and income taxes payable, respectively. During 2006, we increased the tax contingency liabilities by $5.0 million through the current income tax provision, settled $0.4 million with payment and reversed $4.2 million of the opening balance as of October 1, 2005 to goodwill for issues where the statute of limitations on assessment of tax had expired during 2006 (see Notes 3 and 14 to the financial statements). Pension and other employee benefits We maintain a pension plan and a supplemental retirement plan. These plans are defined benefit pension plans. In addition to providing pension benefits, we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents. These pension and other employee benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, as well as our actual experience. The discount rate is subject to change each year, based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality, corporate, non callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve. Changes in applicable high quality long term corporate bond indices, such as the Moodys AA Corporate Bond Index, are also considered. The discount rate determined on this basis was 6% as of December 31, 2006, an increase of 25 basis points from 50 Table of Contents December 31, 2005. This had the effect of reducing our benefit obligations for pensions by $10.7 million and for other employee benefits by $2.5 million as of December 31, 2006, as compared with December 31, 2005. The expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plans projected benefit obligation, asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk. Allowable investment types include equity investments and fixed income investments. Pension plan assets are managed by Russell Investment Corp. (Russell), which allocates the assets into specified Russell designed funds as we direct. Each specified Russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by Russell. The targeted long term allocation of our pension plan assets is 60% in equity investments and 40% in fixed income investments. Based on this target allocation, the twenty year historical return of our asset mix has been 10.1%. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets determined on this basis was 9.0% for 2006, 2005 and 2004. For 2007, we will use an expected long term rate of return of 8.5%. Effective July 1, 2006, we amended our pension plan to standardize the future benefits earned at all company locations. These amendments did not change any benefits earned through June 30, 2006. As a result of the amendments, all locations now have a career average plan that requires a contribution in order to receive the highest level of benefits. All current participants now earn future benefits under the same formula and have the same early retirement provisions. The amendments did not apply to certain employees under a bargaining unit arrangement. Additionally, employees hired after June 30, 2006, do not participate in the defined benefit pension plan but participate in our defined contribution savings plan with an enhanced benefit. As a result of these amendments, our ongoing pension expense has been reduced commencing July 1, 2006, and it is expected that our cash funding requirement will be less than previously anticipated commencing in 2007. These pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are expected to decrease to approximately $13 million in 2007 from $15 million in 2006, primarily due to the full year effect of the July 1, 2006 pension plan amendment, partially offset by the reduction to the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. Lowering the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return each by 0.5% would have increased these pension and other employee postretirement benefits costs by approximately $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in 2006. The benefit obligations for pensions and other employee benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $172 million at December 31, 2006 (the unfunded benefit obligations). In connection with our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, (SFAS 158), we are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet. As a result, we reduced our recorded liability for pensions by $50.5 million, with a corresponding credit to accumulated other comprehensive income, and increased our recorded liability for other benefits by $1.0 million, with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income, to adjust to our actual unfunded benefit obligations. The unfunded benefit obligations were measured using a discount rate of 6% as of December 31, 2006. Lowering the discount rate by 0.5% would have increased the unfunded benefit obligations by approximately $26.6 million. Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of Lorals pension and other employee benefits plans Stock Based Compensation Effective October 1, 2005, in connection with our adoption of fresh start accounting, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation, for all stock options granted by us after October 1, 2005, pursuant to the prospective method provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to measure fair value of these stock option awards. This is the same method we used in prior years for disclosure purposes. The Black Scholes Merton model requires us to make significant judgments regarding the assumptions used within the model, the most significant of which are the stock price volatility assumption, the expected life of the option award, the risk free rate of return and dividends during the expected term. We emerged from bankruptcy on November 21, 2005, and as a result, we do not have sufficient stock price history upon which to base our volatility assumption. In determining the volatility used in our model, we considered the volatility of the stock prices of selected companies in the satellite industry, the nature of those companies, our emergence from bankruptcy and other factors in determining our stock price volatility. For 2006, we used a stock 51 Table of Contents price volatility assumption of 27%. We based our estimate of the average life of a stock option of 4.75 years using the midpoint between the vesting and expiration dates as allowed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment, based upon the vesting period of 4 years and the option term of seven years. Our risk free rate of return assumption for options granted in 2006 of 4.4% was based on the quoted yield for five year U.S. treasury bonds as of the date of grant (see Note 15 to the financial statements). We assumed no dividends during the expected term. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the amount by which the Companys reorganization equity value exceeded the fair value of its tangible assets and identified intangible assets less its liabilities as determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 141, as of October 1, 2005. Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), goodwill is not amortized and is subject to an annual impairment test which the Company, with the assistance of an independent appraiser, performs on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Our test of goodwill impairment for 2006 did not result in any goodwill impairment. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units (the operating segment). SFAS 142 requires the Company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value (see Note 4 to the financial statements). Intangible assets consist primarily of backlog, orbital slots, trade names and customer relationships, all of which were recorded in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting. We used the work of an independent appraiser to assist us in determining the fair value of our intangible assets. The fair values were calculated using several approaches that encompassed the use of excess earnings, relief from royalty and the build up methods. The excess earnings, relief from royalty and build up approaches are variations of the income approach. The income approach, more commonly known as the discounted cash flow approach, estimates fair value based on the cash flows that an asset can be expected to generate over its useful life. Identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Contingencies Contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss, if any. We accrue for costs relating to litigation, claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. Such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on managements judgment, as appropriate. Actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated, and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made. Management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved, coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments. The most important contingencies affecting our financial statements are detailed in Note 19 to the financial statements, Commitments and Contingencies. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Available Credit As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $305.2 million of cash, short term investments and restricted cash, of which $106.6 is in the form of short term investments and $12 million is in the form of restricted cash ($3 million included in other current assets and $9 million included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet). During the next 12 months, we expect to use a significant portion of our available cash and short term investments, as well as proceeds from the preferred stock financing, for the Telesat acquisition, capital expenditures, including the continued construction of Telstar 11N and facilities expansion for the Satellite Manufacturing segment, and for working capital requirements. We believe that cash and short term investments 52 Table of Contents as of December 31, 2006, net cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds from the preferred stock financing, will be adequate to meet our expected cash requirement for activities in the normal course of business, planned capital expenditures and the Telesat acquisition, through at least the next 12 months. On December 16, 2006, a joint venture formed by the Company and its Canadian partner, PSP, entered into a definitive agreement with BCE Inc. to acquire 100% of the stock of Telesat Canada and certain other assets for CAD 3.25 billion (approximately $2.79 billion based on an exchange rate of $1.00/CAD 1.1652). Our net cash funding requirement for this transaction will be funded from some or all of the following: cash and short term investments, a portion of the proceeds from the preferred stock financing or cash flow from operations. If the Telesat acquisition and the Skynet Transaction had occurred on December 31, 2006, Lorals net cash funding requirements would have amounted to approximately $207 million. See The Telesat Canada Transaction below. While operating during bankruptcy, the Company was restricted in its investment options for surplus cash by the U.S. Trustee, resulting in our being able to only invest our surplus cash in an approved money market fund. Since emerging from bankruptcy, the Company has reviewed its investment options and has developed an investment program that increases return while maintaining a conservative risk profile. The Company adopted an investment policy statement that establishes conservative policies relating to and governing the investment of its surplus cash. The investment policy does not permit the Company to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does it permit the Company to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal, to meet all liquidity requirements of the Company and to provide a competitive rate of return. The investment policy addresses dealer qualifications, lists approved securities, establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings, sets concentration limits, defines a maturity structure, requires all firms to safe keep securities on our behalf, requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio. The Company operates its investment program under the guidelines of its investment policy. On February 27, 2007, Loral completed a $300 million preferred stock financing pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement entered into with MHR on October 17, 2006. Loral sold 136,526 shares of its 7.5% Series A 1 perpetual preferred stock (the Series A 1 Preferred Stock) and 858,486 shares of its 7.5% Series B 1 perpetual preferred stock (the Series B 1 Preferred Stock and together with the Series A 1 Preferred Stock, the Loral Series 1 Preferred Stock) at a purchase price of $301.504 per share to various funds affiliated with MHR. Each share of the Series A 1 Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into ten shares of Loral common stock at an initial conversion price of $30.1504 per share. Following shareholder approval of the creation of a new class of Class B 1 non voting common stock, each share of the Series B 1 Preferred Stock will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into ten shares of this Class B 1 non voting common stock at an initial conversion price of $30.1504 per share. Under certain circumstances, the Series B 1 Preferred Stock and the Class B 1 non voting common stock may also be converted by the holder into Loral common stock, in the case of the Series B 1 Preferred Stock, at the same conversion price, and in the case of the Class B 1 non voting common stock, on a share for share basis. The initial conversion price reflects a premium of 12% to the closing price of Lorals common stock on the day before the Securities Purchase Agreement was entered into. Dividends on the Loral Series 1 Preferred Stock will be paid in kind (i.e., in additional shares of Loral Series 1 Preferred Stock) through April 2011. Thereafter, if Loral satisfies certain financial requirements, the dividends will be payable in cash or in kind at Lorals option. Pursuant to the terms of this financing, MHR has the right to nominate one additional member to the Loral board. As a result of the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date the financing was completed, as compared to the initial conversion price, the Company will reflect a beneficial conversion feature of the Loral Series 1 Preferred Stock as a component of its earnings per share calculation for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 for the Series A 1 Preferred Stock and for the Series B 1 Preferred Stock, in the period in which shareholder approval of the creation of the new class of Class B 1 non voting common stock is received. This beneficial conversion feature, currently estimated to be a maximum of approximately $170 million in the aggregate (assuming shareholder approval of the Class B 1 non voting common stock is obtained and before any discount in value for the Class B 1 non voting common stock because of its non voting status), will not be recorded as a charge to net income, but will serve as a one time reduction in the calculation of both the basic and diluted earnings per share results. Accordingly, our basic and diluted earnings per share results will be reduced by approximately $8.60 per share for the beneficial conversion feature for such periods, in the aggregate. In the future, to the extent that dividends on the Loral Series 1 Preferred Stock are paid in additional shares of Loral Series 1 Preferred Stock, we 53 Table of Contents will incur additional beneficial conversion features that would affect the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations in a similar manner. We plan to use the proceeds from this preferred stock financing, together with our existing resources, to meet some or all of the following needs: (a) funding the long term growth of our businesses by constructing satellites for our Satellite Services business and by expanding our Satellite Manufacturing business (including both facilities expansion and working capital requirements); and (b) equipping us to respond quickly to strategic transactions or alliances, including the completion of the Telesat acquisition. It is possible, however, that we will further access the financial markets to meet these objectives or to better position our capital structure. Approximately $3 million in the aggregate is required to pay the remaining claims from the Plan of Reorganization and the expenses associated with completing the reorganization activity and will be paid from existing cash on hand. Cash requirements at Satellite Manufacturing are driven primarily by working capital requirements to finance long term receivables associated with satellite contracts and capital spending required to maintain and expand the manufacturing facility. We believe that the Satellite Manufacturing cash flow from operations is sufficient to fund the capital required to maintain the current manufacturing operations and working capital associated with our current backlog level. Capital requirements to expand the manufacturing facility beyond its current capabilities and offer customer financing terms beyond standard terms will be funded from some or all of the following: cash and short term investments, the proceeds from the preferred stock financing, cash flow from operations, or through additional financing activity. The incremental cost of such expansions or upgrades could be up to $150 million over the next three years. Historically, a portion of Satellite Manufacturing revenues are paid to SS/L in the form of orbitals, receivable payments from its customers that are earned over the life of the satellite. These payments are contingent upon continued satellite performance. As of December 31, 2006, SS/L had orbital receivables of $83 million, which will be received over 18 years, an increase of $33 million from orbital receivables of $48 million as of December 31, 2005. Continued growth in the Satellite Manufacturing business will result in a corresponding growth in the amount of such orbital receivables. To fund such growth, SS/L may be required to obtain additional financing. Annual receipts from the existing Satellite Services business are fairly predictable because they are primarily derived from an established base of long term customer contracts and high contract renewal rates. We believe that the Satellite Services cash flow from operations will be sufficient to provide for its maintenance capital requirements and to fund any cash portion of its interest and preferred dividend obligations through the closing of the Skynet Transaction. Cash required for the construction of the Telstar 11N satellite will be funded from some or all of the following: cash and short term investments, the proceeds from the preferred stock financing, cash flow from operations, or through additional financing activity. On November 21, 2005, SS/L entered into a $20 million amended and restated letter of credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank extending the maturity date of the facility to December 31, 2006. On October 31, 2006, SS/L entered into an amendment to this amended and restated letter of credit agreement further extending the maturity of the facility to December 31, 2007 and reducing the facility availability to $15 million. Letters of credit are available until the earlier of the stated maturity of the letter of credit, the termination of the facility, or December 31, 2007. Outstanding letters of credit are fully cash collateralized. As of December 31, 2006, $3.2 million of letters of credit under this facility were issued and outstanding. On June 7, 2006, SS/L entered into a Customer Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. (Sirius), effective as of May 31, 2006. Under the Credit Agreement, SS/L has agreed, if requested, to make loans to Sirius in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to finance the purchase of the Sirius FM 5 Satellite (the Satellite), including to reimburse Sirius for certain payments made by it under the satellite purchase agreement with SS/L dated May 31, 2006 (the Purchase Agreement). Any loans made under the Credit Agreement will be secured by Sirius rights under the Purchase Agreement, including its rights to the Satellite. The loans also will be guaranteed by Satellite CD Radio, a subsidiary of Sirius Inc., and, subject to certain exceptions, will be guaranteed by any future material subsidiary that may be formed by Sirius thereafter. The maturity date of any loans will be the earliest to occur of (i) April 6, 2009, (ii) 90 days after the Satellite becomes available for shipment and (iii) 30 days prior to the scheduled launch of the Satellite. Loans made under the Credit 54 Table of Contents Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to three month LIBOR plus a margin. The Credit Agreement permits Sirius to prepay all or a portion of the loans outstanding without penalty. As of December 31, 2006, Sirius had made the required milestone payments to SS/L under the Purchase Agreement and, accordingly, no loans were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2006, Sirius was eligible to borrow $30 million under the Credit Agreement. On November 21, 2005, Loral Skynet completed the sale of $126 million of Senior Secured Notes (the Loral Skynet Notes). The Loral Skynet Notes mature on November 15, 2015 and bear interest at 14% payable semi annually beginning July 15, 2006. No principal payments prior to the maturity date are required. On July 17, 2006, Loral Skynet paid accrued interest of $11.5 million in cash. The Loral Skynet Notes are guaranteed by certain of Loral Skynets subsidiaries. The obligations of Loral Skynet and the subsidiary guarantors are secured by a first priority lien on certain specified assets of Loral Skynet and the guarantors pursuant to the security agreements entered into on November 21, 2005. The related indenture contains restrictive covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions, Loral Skynets and its subsidiaries ability to take certain actions, including restricted payments, as defined, incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, payment of certain dividends or distributions, issuance or sale of capital stock of subsidiaries, sale of assets, affiliate transactions and sale/leaseback and merger transactions. Our ability to redeem these notes in the near term is limited. Prior to November 22, 2009, we may redeem the notes at a redemption price of 110% plus accrued and unpaid interest, unless we receive an objection notice from holders of two thirds of the principal amount of the notes. After this period, the notes are redeemable at our option at a redemption price of 110%, declining over time to 100% in 2014, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Proceeds from the sale of the Loral Skynet Notes were used to acquire certain satellite services assets from Old Loral and certain of its subsidiaries and to fund certain cash claims in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization Redemption of the Loral Skynet Notes is a condition to the closing of the Skynet Transaction. See The Telesat Canada Transaction and Note 12 to the financial statements. To the extent the Company is required to obtain financing, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, if at all. In connection with the Telesat transaction, Loral Skynet has entered into certain derivative transactions. In the event that the Telesat acquisition failed to close and we had to unwind these derivative transactions, Loral Skynet could have liability exposure of up to $117.5 million depending on currency rate fluctuations, as of March 1, 2007 (see Note 18 to the financial statements). We are required under the terms of our agreement with PSP to have expended at least $130 million towards the cost of construction, launch and insurance of Telstar 11N by the closing date of the Skynet Transaction or to make a cash capital contribution to Holdings for the amount of any difference (see The Telesat Canada Transaction.). The Telesat Canada Transaction On December 16, 2006, a joint venture company (Acquireco) formed by Loral and its Canadian partner, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP) entered into a definitive agreement with BCE Inc. to acquire 100% of the stock of Telesat Canada and certain other assets from BCE Inc. for CAD 3.25 billion (approximately $2.79 billion based on an exchange rate of $1.00/CAD 1.1652), which purchase price is not subject to adjustment for Telesat Canadas performance during the pre closing period. Under the terms of this purchase agreement, the economic value of Telesat Canadas business is, subject to certain exceptions, being operated for Acquirecos benefit beginning from December 16, 2006. Telesat Canada is the leading satellite services provider in Canada and earns its revenues principally through the provision of broadcast and business network services over seven in orbit satellites. This transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including approvals of the relevant Canadian and U.S. government authorities, and is expected to close in mid 2007. Loral and PSP have agreed to guarantee 64% and 36%, respectively, of Acquirecos obligations under the Telesat share purchase agreement, up to CAD 200 million. At the time of, or following the Telesat acquisition, substantially all of Loral Skynets assets and related liabilities will be transferred to a subsidiary of Acquireco at an agreed upon enterprise valuation, subject to downward adjustment under certain circumstances (the Skynet Transaction). This subsidiary will be combined with Telesat Canada and the resulting new entity (New Telesat) will be a Canadian company that will be headquartered in Ottawa. Following the completion of the Skynet Transaction, New Telesat will be the worlds 55 Table of Contents fourth largest operator of telecommunications satellites, with a combined fleet of eleven in orbit satellites and four additional satellites to be placed in service over the next four years. New Telesat will feature a management team to be drawn from both Telesat Canada and Loral Skynet. This combined Telesat Loral Skynet company will offer its customers expanded satellite and terrestrial coverage and continue to offer superior customer service. Loral Skynets satellite fleet provides an array of video and data services primarily outside of North America, and will complement Telesat Canadas North American fleet, which hosts video and data distribution services across North America, as well as serving as the platform for Canadas two premier direct to home video services. We and PSP have arranged for the parent company of Acquireco (Holdings) to obtain $3.1 billion of committed debt financing from a group of financial institutions, of which up to approximately $2.8 billion is available to fund the purchase price of the Telesat acquisition. PSP has agreed to contribute approximately CAD 595.8 million in cash to Holdings, of which $150 million (or CAD 174.8 million based on an exchange rate of $1.00/CAD 1.1652) will be for the purchase of a Holdings fixed rate senior non convertible mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. In addition to Lorals agreement to transfer the Loral Skynet assets to New Telesat, Loral will have net cash funding requirements in connection with the transaction, which, had the Telesat acquisition and the Skynet Transaction occurred on December 31, 2006, would have amounted to approximately $207 million. Loral Skynets existing 12% preferred stock and 14% senior notes will be redeemed in connection with the Skynet Transaction. To the extent necessary, there will be an appropriate cash true up at closing between us, PSP and New Telesat to reflect the amount of our relative contributions, after giving effect to among other things, the exchange rate then in effect, gains and or losses on hedging transactions, the spending on Telstar 11N, and in the event of a material adverse change to Loral Skynets business during the interim period, the resulting diminution in the agreed upon value of Loral Skynet. Upon the closings of the Telesat acquisition and the Skynet Transaction, which closings we currently expect to occur simultaneously, we would hold equity interests in Holdings, the ultimate parent company of New Telesat, effectively representing 64% of the economic interests and 331/3% of the voting power of New Telesat. PSP would in turn acquire the preferred stock described above, and equity interests effectively representing 36% of the economic interest, and together with two other Canadian investors, 662/3% of the voting power, of New Telesat. For further discussions on Telesat Canada and the related transactions, and Lorals obligations in respect thereof, including in the case where the Skynet Transaction does not close simultaneously with the Telesat acquisition, see Segment Overview Telesat Canada, Risk Factors Financial and Telesat Transaction Risk Factors and Equity and Funding Requirements (below). Summary Financial Information Summary financial information of Loral Skynet and Telesat Canada, for the year ended and as of December 31, 2006, follows (CAD in millions). Where applicable, all information has been translated from US dollars to Canadian dollars (CAD). Income statement information has been translated using the average exchange rate for 2006 of $1.00/CAD 1.1344 and balance sheet and backlog information have been translated using the December 31, 2006 exchange rate of $1.00/CAD 1.1652. 56 Table of Contents Loral Skynet Telesat (CAD in millions) Revenues 185.4 479.0 Adjusted EBITDA 77.1 261.0 Operating Income 12.8 140.3 Net Income (Loss) (46.7 ) 102.5 Cash and Cash Equivalents 18.7 38.6 Total Assets 867.8 1,773.8 Debt, including current portion 149.2 203.9 Shareholders Equity 510.5 879.6 Backlog 413.6 5,188.0 Synergies The combination of Loral Skynet and Telesat Canada will provide the opportunity for New Telesat to benefit from synergies in those areas where redundancies exist. These areas include overhead and support functions, space segment facilities and ground segment facilities. During an implementation period of less than one year, we expect to incur non recurring charges of approximately CAD 30 million to CAD 45 million to effect such cost savings. After this implementation period, it is expected that New Telesat would benefit from approximately CAD 45 million to CAD 70 million annually from these synergies, some portion of which we expect will be realized commencing immediately after closing of the transaction. The summary financial information included herein does not include the benefit from any cost saving synergies which may be achievable after the close of the transactions. Nor does the summary financial data include non recurring charges such as the costs to implement these synergies as discussed above, transaction related payments to executive management of Telesat Canada upon closing the Telesat acquisition of approximately CAD 32.5 million, payments under retention plans of approximately CAD 6.6 million and redemption premiums relating to the early extinguishment of Loral Skynets and Telesat Canadas debt of approximately CAD 21.1 million. Liquidity The Telesat purchase price of CAD 3.25 billion as well as acquisition fees and expenses and the repayment of existing Loral Skynet and Telesat financing will be financed by cash from Loral and PSP, as well as borrowings by New Telesat. Although a significant portion of the financing commitment is in U.S. dollars, the following descriptions of such cash requirements and borrowings are stated in Canadian dollars (CAD). Where applicable, Canadian dollars have been translated to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2006 exchange rate of $1.00/CAD 1.1652. New Telesat will have capital expenditure requirements of approximately $576 million over the next three years, as more fully described in Capital Expenditures below. This requirement is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations as well as the availability of the Term Loan B 2 (see below). New Telesat does not expect to have a significant cash requirement for taxes in the near future due to deductions for the interest cost to be incurred and future depreciation and amortization. Equity and Funding Requirements At the time of, or following the Telesat acquisition, substantially all of Loral Skynets assets and related liabilities will be transferred to a subsidiary of Acquireco at an agreed upon enterprise valuation, subject to downward adjustment under certain circumstances. PSP has agreed to contribute approximately CAD 595.8 million in cash to Holdings, of which $150 million (CAD 174.8 million) will be for the purchase of a Holdings fixed rate senior non convertible mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. At closing of the Telesat acquisition, assuming a simultaneous closing of the Skynet Transaction, we would hold equity interests in Holdings, the ultimate parent company of New Telesat, effectively representing 64% of the economic interests and 331/3% of the voting power, of New Telesat. PSP would in turn acquire the preferred stock 57 Table of Contents described above, and equity interests effectively representing 36% of the economic interest, and together with two other Canadian investors, 662/3% of the voting power of New Telesat. If the Telesat acquisition and the Skynet Transaction were to occur at the same time, then on the closing date, Holdings will redeem the principal amount of Loral Skynets outstanding 14% senior notes (approximately $126 million as of December 31, 2006) and Loral will redeem Loral Skynets outstanding 12% preferred stock and accrued dividends thereon (approximately $226 million as of December 31, 2006), as well as pay all interest and redemption premium (approximately $21 million as of December 31, 2006) and any other amounts that may be due in respect of Loral Skynets senior notes. See Risk Factors Financial and Telesat Transaction Risk Factors. If the Skynet Transaction does not close simultaneously with the Telesat acquisition, Loral would in place of funding the redemption of Loral Skynets preferred stock and accrued dividends and interest and redemption premium on Loral Skynets senior notes (approximately $247 million as of December 31, 2006), make a cash equity contribution to Holdings of CAD 270.9 million (approximately $233 million) to acquire redeemable shares of Holdings. Upon the later closing of the Skynet Transaction, Holdings will draw upon its credit facilities to redeem the principal amount of Loral Skynets senior notes and the redeemable shares issued to Loral. Loral will use the proceeds from Holdings to redeem Loral Skynets preferred stock and pay the interest, premium and any other amounts due under the Loral Skynet notes. Lorals economic interest in Holdings would be proportionately reduced from 64% to approximately 38%, assuming an exchange rate of $1.00/CAD 1.1652, to reflect the fact that it has not contributed the Skynet assets into New Telesat, but would be reinstated to 64% upon the closing of the Skynet Transaction. We would have a year from the closing of the Telesat acquisition to complete the Skynet Transaction. If we are unable to close the Skynet Transaction during that period, we would then be required, under the terms of our agreement with PSP, to contribute our rights to the Telstar 11N satellite as well as $175 million in cash (the Alternative Contribution) to New Telesat, in order to bring our economic interest in Holdings to 64%. See Risk Factors Financial and Telesat Transaction Risk Factors. To the extent necessary, upon closing of the Telesat acquisition, the Skynet Transaction and or the Alternative Contribution, as the case may be, there will be an appropriate cash true up between us, PSP and New Telesat to reflect the amount of our relative contributions, after giving effect to among other things, the exchange rate then in effect, gains and or losses on hedging transactions, the spending on Telstar 11N, in the event of a material adverse change to Loral Skynets business during the interim period, the resulting diminution in the agreed upon value of Loral Skynet, and in the event the Alternative Contribution is effected in place of the Skynet Transaction, the extent to which the value of the Alternative Contribution is greater or less than the agreed upon value of the Skynet Transaction. Debt In connection with the acquisition we have received a commitment from a syndicate of banks to provide New Telesat with, in each case as described below, senior secured credit facilities (the Credit Facility) and a senior bridge facility (the Bridge Facility) (together the Facilities). As is customary with such Facilities, the lead arrangers of such Facilities have reserved the right at any time, after consulting with us, to change the pricing, structure or other terms of the Facilities to ensure a successful syndication. It is the current intent to issue on the acquisition date senior unsecured notes that will make it unnecessary to draw on the Bridge Facility. If the Bridge Facility is drawn, New Telesat would intend to refinance it promptly through the issuance of replacement senior unsecured notes. It is expected that the senior unsecured notes would have standard market terms and conditions for a financing of this type. Senior Secured Credit Facilities The Credit Facility will consist of the following tranches that each contain a discussion of its costs, terms and conditions. The applicable margins of the Facilities will be based upon the achievement of certain credit ratings and the lenders will have the ability to increase such margins depending on agreed upon conditions up to 1.0% at the maximum. 58 Table of Contents Term Loan A The CAD 500 million loan ($429 million) will have a maturity of five years from issuance. The Term Loan A will be denominated in CAD and will bear interest at a floating rate of the Bankers Acceptance rate plus an applicable margin. Term Loan B The Term Loan B facility is for a $1.054 billion loan with a maturity of seven years from issuance. In order to hedge the currency risk for New Telesat both at closing and over the life of the loans, Loral Skynet entered into a currency basis swap to synthetically convert the US dollar commitment to CAD 1.224 billion. An additional feature of the basis swap is that the Term Loan B will bear interest at a floating rate of Bankers Acceptance plus an applicable margin. For more information about the basis swap see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Term Loan B 1 The Term Loan B 1 facility is a $386 million (CAD 450 million) loan with a maturity of seven years after the closing date of the Telesat acquisition, which bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The Term Loan B 1 includes the option for a 1 year delayed draw period so proceeds can be used to repay Loral Skynets existing financing arrangements if the Skynet Transaction were to occur after the closing of the Telesat acquisition. If the closing of the Telesat acquisition and the Skynet Transaction were to occur simultaneously, the Term Loan B 1 will be drawn at the acquisition closing to fund the Telesat acquisition. Term Loan B 2 The Term Loan B 2 facility is a $150 million (CAD 175 million) delayed draw loan with the same interest rate and maturity as the Term Loan B 1. The Term Loan B 2 is available to be drawn for 18 months after the closing of the acquisition to fund satellite capital expenditures. The undrawn amount of the Term Loan B 2 is subject to a commitment fee. Revolving Credit The Credit Facility also includes a CAD denominated revolving credit facility of up to the Canadian dollar equivalent of $150 million (CAD 175 million) that is expected to be undrawn at the closing of the acquisition. The Revolving Credit facility matures five years after issuance and is available to be drawn at any time. The drawn loans will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Undrawn amounts under the facility are subject to a commitment fee. Senior Bridge Facility The Bridge Facility is a committed $910 million (CAD 1,060 million) senior unsecured loan available to the borrower on the closing date of the acquisition. The Bridge Facility has a maturity of one year and an initial interest rate per annum equal to the greater of a fixed percentage or three month LIBOR plus the applicable margin, excluding any additional payment required to compensate lenders for Canadian withholding tax. The applicable margin increases over time up to a cap. Lenders under the Bridge Facility have also committed to provide rollover loans at the maturity of the Bridge Facility for an additional seven years. The current intent is not to borrow the Bridge Facility but instead to issue senior unsecured notes to finance the Telesat acquisition. However, if for any reason the senior notes are not issued at closing, the Bridge Facility is available to fund the acquisition. Interest Expense An estimate of the interest expense on the Facilities after they are drawn down is based upon assumptions of LIBOR and Bankers Acceptance rates and the applicable margin for the Facilities. Based upon market conditions at December 31, 2006 and assuming the Bridge Facility is not drawn upon, it is estimated that New Telesats interest expense in the first full year of operations would be approximately CAD 268 million. If the Bridge Facility were to 59 Table of Contents be drawn upon, it is estimated this interest expense could increase by approximately CAD 17 million, assuming CAD 11 million to compensate lenders for Canadian withholding tax. The historical results of Loral Skynet and Telesat Canada for 2006, include interest expense of approximately CAD 20 million and CAD 17 million, respectively, for debt that will be refinanced in connection with the Telesat acquisition and the Skynet Transaction, a portion of which was capitalized in connection with satellites under construction. Capital Expenditures Telesat Canada has entered into satellite construction contracts for the Anik F3, Nimiq 4 and Nimiq 5 satellites and Loral Skynet has entered into a satellite construction contract for Telstar 11N. Capital expenditure requirements for these contracts total approximately $252 million in 2007, $224 million in 2008 and $100 million in 2009. These expenditures will be funded by New Telesats cash flow from operations as well as the delayed draw Term Loan B 2. Incremental cash operating costs for new satellites entering the fleet is typically approximately CAD 6 million annually, primarily for insurance. Backlog As of December 31, 2006, the backlog of Loral Skynet and Telesat Canada was CAD 414 million and CAD 5.188 billion, respectively and there were approximately 116 36 MHz equivalent transponders that were not utilized and available for lease on the Loral Skynet and Telesat Canada in orbit satellites. Included in the backlog of Telesat Canada as of December 31, 2006, is CAD 3.207 billion for 66.6 36 MHz equivalent transponders on satellites under construction as detailed in Capital Expenditures above. These transponders have been leased under contracts expected to generate aggregate revenue of approximately CAD 210 million annually for the life of the satellites. In addition, these contracts contain provisions such that the customers, assuming the respective satellites are successfully launched and are operating nominally, may only terminate their contracts by paying Telesat Canada the present value of the entire contracted amounts that would have been due for the remaining life of the satellite. As of December 31, 2006, there are approximately 85 36 MHz equivalent transponders that are available for lease on the Loral Skynet and Telesat Canada satellites under construction. Loral Skynet and Telesat Canada have received approximately CAD 319 million of customer prepayments, including in the case of Telesat Canada, approximately CAD 85 million relating to satellites under construction. If the launch of such satellite(s) under construction were to fail, Telesat Canada would be obligated to return the customer prepayments applicable to such satellite. Such repayment obligations would be funded by insurance proceeds, cash on hand and or availability under the revolving credit facility. Telesat Canada anticipates that in the event of a satellite launch failure the customer would contract with them for replacement capacity. Revenue to be realized from backlog as of December 31, 2006, the amount of non cash revenue that represents amortization of existing customer prepayments and the number of 36 MHz equivalent transponders expected to be available for lease at the beginning of each year are as follows: Loral Skynet Telesat Canada Non cash Non cash Annual Revenue Transponders Annual Revenue Transponders Revenue Related to Available Revenue Related to Available From Customer (36 MHz From Customer (36 MHz Backlog(1) Prepayments equivalents)(2) Backlog(1) Prepayments equivalents)(2) (CAD in millions) (CAD in millions) (CAD in millions) (CAD in millions) 2007 117.3 6.3 50 386.5 37.5 66 2008 78.8 4.1 81 406.6 28.9 108 2009 60.0 2.4 161 403.5 25.6 120 2010 42.3 1.2 175 449.4 23.9 123 2011 34.6 0.3 159 413.4 23.5 121 Thereafter 80.6 1.9 159 3,128.6 163.6 119 Total 413.6 16.2 5,188.0 303.0 60 Table of Contents (1) Annual revenue includes non cash revenue representing amortization of customer prepayments but does not include any revenues that may be generated from the leasing of 58.5 36 MHz equivalent Ku band transponders on Telstar 11N, scheduled to be launched in late 2008. (2) Transponders available at the beginning of each period assumes that the four satellites under construction are launched and placed into service on their current schedule but does not assume replacements for satellites currently in orbit that are nearing their end of life, or renewal of contracts as they expire. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following tables aggregate our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands). Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Debt(1) $ 126,000 $ $ $ $ 126,000 Interest on debt(1) 165,326 17,640 35,280 35,280 77,126 Operating leases(2) 110,613 19,582 34,725 24,013 32,293 Unconditional purchase obligations(3) 677,773 466,814 199,007 11,887 65 Other long term obligations(4) 61,550 24,044 33,032 912 3,562 Total contractual cash obligations(5) $ 1,141,262 $ 528,080 $ 302,044 $ 72,092 $ 239,046 Other Commercial Commitments: Total Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Amounts Less than More than Committed 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Standby letters of credit(6) $ 3,193 $ 3,193 $ $ $ (1) Represents cash obligations for principal payments and interest payments on Loral Skynet 14% senior secured notes (see Note 12 to the financial statements for further detail on our debt obligations). The Loral Skynet notes will be redeemed in connection with the Skynet Transaction, following which Loral Skynet will no longer have any further contractual obligation related to this debt. (2) Represents future minimum payments under operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more, net of sub lease rentals of $0.3 million. (3) SS/L has entered into various purchase commitments with suppliers due to the long lead times required to produce purchased parts. (4) Primarily represents vendor financing related amounts owed to subcontractors and amounts due to APT, representing Lorals share of the project cost of Telstar 18, and commitments under employment agreements. (5) Other than the interest on Loral Skynet senior notes which is reflected separately in the table, does not include our net cash funding requirements of approximately $207 million in connection with the Telesat acquisition, assuming a simultaneous close with the Skynet Transaction. This amount is as of December 31, 2006, and is subject to change depending on the actual closing date of the Telesat acquisition. (6) Letters of credit have a maturity of one year and are renewed annually. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Continuing Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 was $88 million. This was primarily due to the net loss adjusted for non cash items of $86 million, an increase in customer advances of $51 million resulting from timing of satellite program milestone payments and higher accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $18 million in part due to higher accrued interest. This change was partially offset by an increase in inventory of $32 million, which will accommodate the increased volume and a reduction of $20 million in pension and other postretirement liabilities primarily due to contributions made to the pension plan of $27 million (see Note 17 to the financial statements). 61 Table of Contents Net cash used in operating activities for the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005, for the period January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 was $38 million and $144 million, respectively, totaling $182 million for 2005. This was primarily due to $80 million of payments to creditors in connection with our Plan of Reorganization, the reduction in customer advances of $56 million because of continued progress on the related programs and the deferral of billings of $46 million in connection with certain SS/L contracts (see Note 7 to the financial statements). Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2004 was $40 million. This was primarily due to an increase in customer advances of $35 million from new satellite programs receipts and a decrease of contracts in process of $29 million primarily resulting from net collections on customer contracts, which was offset by the net loss adjusted for non cash items of $59 million. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Discontinued Operations For 2004, represents the net cash provided from the operations of the North American satellites and related equipment sold. Net Cash (Used in) Provided By Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2006 was $176 million, resulting from capital expenditures of $82 million and the Companys purchase of short term investments of $107 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $7 million and proceeds received from the disposition of an orbital slot of $6 million. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities for the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005, and the period January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 was $(5) million and $195 million, respectively, totaling $190 million for 2005, primarily resulting from the insurance proceeds received for our Telstar 14 Satellite. Net cash provided by investing activities was $907 million for 2004, primarily resulting from the $954 million of proceeds from the sale of our North American satellites and related assets, net of expenses, offset by capital expenditures for continuing operations of $25 million and capital expenditures for discontinued operations of $11 million, mainly for the construction of satellites, and investments in and advances to affiliates of $6 million, primarily for XTAR. Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for 2006 was $1 million, resulting from the cash dividend payment on the Loral Skynet preferred stock made in the third quarter. Net cash provided by financing activities for the period October 2, 2005 to December 31, 2005 and the period January 1, 2005 to October 1, 2005 was $121 million and zero, respectively, totaling $121 million for 2005, representing the proceeds from the issuance of Loral Skynet Notes (see Note 12 to the financial statements). Net cash used in financing activities was $967 million in 2004, resulting from our repayment of our secured bank debt, primarily with the proceeds from the sale of the North America satellites and related assets. Other In September 2006, Loral made the minimum required contribution of $2.3 million to the pension plan and made an additional voluntary contribution to the pension plan of $25.2 million. The additional voluntary contribution was made to improve the funded status of the pension plan and to reduce future expected contributions. During 2007, based on current estimates, we expect to make no contributions to the qualified pension plan and expect to fund approximately $5 million for other employee post retirement benefit plans. During 2005, we contributed $20 million to the qualified pension plan. 62 Table of Contents Affiliate Matters Loral has made certain investments in joint ventures in the satellite services business that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting (see Notes 9 and 19 to the financial statements for further information on affiliate matters). Our consolidated statements of operations reflect the effects of the following amounts related to transactions with or investments in affiliates (in millions). Successor Registrant Predecessor Registrant For the Period For the Period October 2, January 1, Year Ended 2005 to 2005 to Year Ended December 31, December 31, October 1, December 31, 2006 2005 2005 2004 Revenues $ 11.3 $ 4.1 $ 10.0 $ 7.8 Elimination of Lorals proportionate share of (profits) losses relating to affiliate transactions 0.4 (2.9 ) 0.6 2.4 Profits (losses) relating to affiliate transactions not eliminated (0.3 ) 2.3 (0.5 ) (1.9 ) Commitments and Contingencies Our business and operations are subject to a number of significant risks, the most significant of which are summarized in Item 1A Risk Factors and also in Note 19 to the financial statements, Commitments and Contingencies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency While we were under Chapter 11, SS/Ls hedges with counterparties (primarily yen denominated forward contracts) were cancelled, leaving SS/L vulnerable to foreign currency fluctuations in the future. The absence of forward contracts exposes SS/Ls future revenues, costs and cash associated with anticipated yen and EURO denominated receipts and payments to currency fluctuations. As of December 31, 2006, SS/L had the following amounts denominated in Japanese Yen and EUROs (which have been translated into U.S. dollars based on the December 31, 2006 exchange rates) that were unhedged (in millions): Foreign Currency U.S. $ Future revenues Japanese Yen 72 $ 0.6 Future expenditures Japanese Yen 3,011 $ 25.3 Future expenditures EUROs E 5.2 $ 6.9 Telesat Transaction Derivatives As described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, on December 16, 2006, a joint venture company formed by Loral and PSP entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with BCE Inc. and Telesat Canada for the acquisition of all the shares of Telesat Canada and certain other assets for CAD 3.25 billion. As part of the transaction, the acquisition company received financing commitments from a syndicate of banks for $2.179 billion of Senior Secured Credit Facilities and $910 million of a Senior Unsecured Bridge Facility. The purchase price of Telesat Canada is in Canadian dollars, while most of the debt financing is in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, Loral and PSP have entered into financial commitments to lock in exchange rates to convert some of the U.S. dollar denominated debt proceeds to Canadian dollars. As such, Loral entered into several transactions through its Loral Skynet subsidiary, whereby Loral Skynet guaranteed certain exposures should the Telesat acquisition not close and the transactions are unwound. 63 Table of Contents In December 2006, Loral Skynet entered into a currency basis swap with a single bank counterparty converting $1.054 billion of U.S. debt into CAD 1.224 billion of Canadian debt for a seven year period beginning December 17, 2007. This debt amortizes 1% per year with a final maturity of December 17, 2014. No cash payment was made by Loral to the counterparty for entering into this transaction. This agreement can be closed at any point prior to December 17, 2007 by simply moving all the terms forward to the closing date of the Telesat acquisition without affecting terms. This agreement is assignable to the Canadian borrowing company upon closing of the credit transaction. Loral Skynets liability under this agreement shall not exceed $10 million for the early termination of this agreement resulting from an event of default or termination event. At December 31, 2006, Loral recorded a $2.4 million charge to other income reflecting a mark to market valuation for the swap. In December 2006, Loral Skynet entered into forward foreign currency contracts with a single bank counterparty selling $497.4 million for CAD 570.1 million with a settlement date of December 17, 2007. No cash payment was made by Loral to the counterparty for entering into these transactions. These agreements can be rolled forward to the closing date of the Telesat acquisition with an adjustment in the exchange rate. These agreements are assignable to the Canadian borrowing company upon closing of the credit transaction. Loral Skynets liability under these agreements shall not exceed $72.5 million for the early termination of these agreements resulting from an event of default or termination event. At December 31, Loral recorded a $3.3 million charge to other income reflecting a mark to market valuation for the forward contracts. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, Loral Skynet entered into forward foreign currency contracts with a single bank counterparty selling an additional $200 million for CAD 232.8 million with a settlement date of December 17, 2007. The terms of these transactions are similar to the terms of the December transactions. Loral Skynets liability under these agreements shall not exceed $35 million for the early termination of these agreements resulting from an event of default or termination event. Interest The Company issued long term fixed rate debt at its Loral Skynet Corporation subsidiary upon emergence from bankruptcy. As these instruments are at a fixed rate, the Company does not have any exposure to changes in interest rates with respect thereto. The Company does not actively manage its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives or other financial instruments. As of December 31, 2006, the Company held $114 million in marketable securities consisting of corporate bonds, Euro dollar bonds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper, federal agency notes and auction rate securities. We invest in marketable securities with the intent to hold them to maturity and classify them as such, except for the auction rate securities which we classify as available for sale. At December 31, 2006, the longest maturity date for one of our investments was 45 days and the weighted average maturity of our marketable securities was approximately 15 days. Due to the short term maturity of our investments and our intent to hold them to maturity, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant. A hypothetical 1% movement in market interest rates on $114 million for 15 days would equate to a $48 thousand interest adjustment. As of December 31, 2006, the carrying value of the Companys long term debt was $128.1 million with related debt issuance costs of $5.8 million which is reflected in Other Assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of such debt was $143.6 million and is based on a market valuation provided to us by an outside financial institution for the Loral Skynet Corporation 14% Senior Notes. The Loral Skynet Notes have a scheduled maturity date in 2015 and have an effective interest rate of 14.6%.
