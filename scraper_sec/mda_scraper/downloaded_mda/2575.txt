Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Statements Certain statements made below are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995 and included this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. Forward looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words believe, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, project, or similar expressions. You should not rely on forward looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect our actual results, performance or achievements. Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations, including trends which might appear, are not necessarily indicative of future operations. General Overview In November 2005 we completed the acquisition of the final two thirds interest in the COROC joint venture which owned nine factory outlet centers totaling approximately 3.3 million square feet. We originally purchased a one third interest in December 2003. From December 2003 to November 2005, COROC was consolidated for financial reporting purposes under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003): Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities: An Interpretation of ARB No. 51, or FIN 46R. The purchase price for the final two thirds interest of COROC was $286.0 million (including closing and acquisition costs of $3.5 million) which we and the Company funded with a combination of unsecured debt and equity raised through the capital markets in the fourth quarter of 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had 30 wholly owned centers in 21 states totaling 8.4 million square feet of GLA compared to 31 centers in 22 states totaling 8.3 million square feet of GLA as of December 31, 2005. The changes in the number of centers and GLA are due to the following events: No. of Centers GLA (000s ) States As of December 31, 2005 31 8,261 22 New development: Charleston, South Carolina 1 352 Dispositions: Pigeon Forge, Tennessee (1 ) (95 ) North Branch, Minnesota (1 ) (134 ) (1 ) Other 4 As of December 31, 2006 30 8,388 21 Results of Operations 2006 Compared to 2005 Base rentals increased $7.5 million, or 6%, in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. Our overall occupancy rates for our stabilized outlet centers were comparable from year to year at 97.5% and 97.0%. Our base rental income increased $4.9 million due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re tenanting vacant space. During 2006, we executed 479 leases totaling 1.9 million square feet at an average increase of 10%. This compares to our execution of 460 leases totaling 1.9 million square feet at an average increase of 6% during 2005. Base rentals also increased approximately $2.1 million due to the August 2006 opening of our new center in Charleston, South Carolina. Additionally, increases were recognized in the net amortization of above or below market leases totaling $723,000. The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease. For the 2006 period, we recorded $1.5 million to rental income for the net amortization of market lease values compared with $741,000 for the 2005 period. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively. At December 31, 2006, the net liability representing the amount of unrecognized below market lease values totaled $2.1 million. Percentage rentals, which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants sales volume above predetermined levels (the "breakpoint"), increased $842,000 or 13%. Reported same space sales per square foot for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were $338 per square foot, a 4.8% increase over the prior year ended December 31, 2005. Same space sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period. Our ability to attract high volume tenants to many of our outlet centers continues to improve the average sales per square foot throughout our portfolio. Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses generally fluctuate consistently with the related reimbursable property operating expenses to which they relate. Expense reimbursements increased $3.1 million, or 6%, in the 2006 period versus the 2005 period. Expense reimbursements, expressed as a percentage of property operating expenses, were 87% and 88% respectively, in the 2006 and 2005 periods. The slight decrease is due to increases in miscellaneous non reimbursable expenses such as state franchise and excise taxes. Other income increased $1.5 million, or 27%, in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the recognition of leasing, marketing and development fee income from our Tanger Wisconsin Dells joint venture, fees from third party management services, gains on sales of outparcels of land and increases in miscellaneous vending income. Property operating expenses increased by $6.0 million, or 9%, in the 2006 period as compared to the 2005 period. Of this increase, $1.8 million relates incrementally to our Charleston, South Carolina outlet center which opened in August 2006. In addition, during 2006 we incurred a $1.5 million charge for the abandonment of acquisition due diligence costs, as we have decided we are no longer in a position to pursue a potential acquisition opportunity. The abandoned acquisition due diligence costs were incurred in connection with structuring, diligencing and submitting a proposal to acquire a significant portfolio from a public REIT that was exploring its strategic alternatives. The bid was requested, but ultimately not accepted, by the public REIT. Excluding these costs associated with the Charleston, South Carolina outlet center and the abandoned due diligence costs, operating expenses increased 4.3 %. This increase was due to higher property insurance costs upon renewal of our annual policies during the year and non reimbursable expenses such as state franchise and excise taxes. General and administrative expenses increased $2.9 million, or 21%, in the 2006 period as compared to the 2005 period. The increase is primarily due to compensation expense related to restricted shares issued during the 2006 period as well as an increase in bonus compensation for senior executives in the 2006 period. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses increased from 7% in the 2005 period to 8% in the 2006 period. Depreciation and amortization increased from $48.2 million in the 2005 period to $57.2 million in the 2006 period. This was due a full year of depreciation of the assets acquired in December 2005 in the final COROC joint venture acquisition and the accelerated depreciation and amortization of certain assets in the initial acquisition of the COROC properties in December 2003 accounted for under FAS 141 for tenants that terminated their leases during the 2006 period. As shown in the table below, total interest expense decreased $2.2 million, or 5%, during the 2006 period as compared to the 2005 period. However, the 2005 period included a large prepayment premium and the write off of deferred loan costs totaling $9.9 million incurred related to the early extinguishment of the $77.4 million John Hancock Life Insurance Company mortgages. Actual interest expense from borrowings increased during 2006 due to higher overall debt levels related to the $250 million senior unsecured note issuance in November 2005 and the $149.5 million exchangeable senior unsecured note issuance in August 2006. Summary of interest expense 2006 2005 Interest expense from borrowings, net of capitalization $38,463 $31,816 Prepayment penalty and deferred loan cost write off related to early extinguishment of debt 917 9,866 Loan cost amortization, net of capitalization 1,395 1,245 Total interest expense $40,775 $42,927 During August 2006, we opened a 264,900 square foot center in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, which is owned by Tanger Wisconsin Dells, in which we have a 50% ownership interest and account for as an unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method. Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased from 2005 to 2006 as a result of the opening of this center. In November 2005, we purchased our consolidated joint venture partners interest in COROC. Therefore, consolidated joint venture minority interest decreased $24.0 million as there was no allocation of earnings to this joint venture partner during 2006. The allocation of earnings to our joint venture partner was based on a preferred return on investment as opposed to their ownership percentage and accordingly had a significant impact on our earnings during 2005. Discontinued operations includes the results of operations and gains on sales of real estate for our Pigeon Forge, Tennessee and North Branch, Minnesota centers, both of which were sold in the first quarter of 2006. The following table summarizes the results of operations and gains on sale of real estate for the 2006 and 2005 periods: Summary of discontinued operations 2006 2005 Operating income from discontinued operations $ 208 $ 2,847 Gain on sale of real estate 13,833 Discontinued operations $ 14,041 $ 2,847 During the first quarter of 2005, we sold our outlet center at our Seymour, Indiana property. Due to significant continuing involvement, the sale did not qualify as discontinued operations under the provisions of FAS 144. We recorded a loss on sale of real estate of $4.7 million as a result of the sale. Net proceeds received for the center were approximately $2.0 million. 2005 Compared to 2004 Base rentals increased $3.9 million, or 3%, in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. Our overall occupancy rates for our stabilized outlet centers were comparable from year to year at 97%. Our base rental income increased $3.9 million due to increases in rental rates on lease renewals and incremental rents from re tenanting vacant space. During 2005, we executed 460 leases totaling 1.9 million square feet at an average increase of 6%. This compares to our execution of 471 leases totaling 2.0 million square feet at an average increase of 6% during 2004. Base rentals also increased approximately $400,000 due to the expansions of our Locust Grove, Georgia and Foley, Alabama centers which both occurred late in the fourth quarter of 2005. The impact of these increases was offset by decreases in the net amortization of above or below market leases totaling $324,000 and decreases in termination fees received of $433,000. The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease. For the 2005 period, we recorded $741,000 to rental income for the net amortization of market lease values compared with $1.1 million for the 2004 period. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related above or below market lease value will be written off and could materially impact our net income positively or negatively. Percentage rentals, which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants sales volume above predetermined levels (the "breakpoint"), increased $1.1 million or 20%. The percentage rents in 2004 were reduced by an allocation to the previous owner of the COROC portfolio for their pro rata share of percentage rents associated with tenants whose sales lease year began prior to December 19, 2003, the date of the initial acquisition. Reported same space sales per square foot for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were $320 per square foot, a 3.4% increase over the prior year ended December 31, 2004. Same space sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period. Our ability to attract high volume tenants to many of our outlet centers continues to improve the average sales per square foot throughout our portfolio. Expense reimbursements, which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance, insurance, property tax, promotional, advertising and management expenses generally fluctuates consistently with the related reimbursable property operating expenses to which it relates. Expense reimbursements increased $4.1 million, or 8%, in the 2005 period versus the 2004 period. Expense reimbursements, expressed as a percentage of property operating expenses, were 88% and 89% in the 2005 and 2004 periods, respectively. Other income decreased $873,000, or 13%, in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a decrease in gains from sales of outparcels of land. Gains of $127,000 and $1.5 million were recognized in the 2005 and 2004 periods, respectively. The decrease was offset by an increase in interest income from proceeds from debt and equity offerings, which were temporarily invested in short term investments until the acquisition of COROC was completed as well as increases in vending income. Property operating expenses increased by $5.0 million, or 9%, in the 2005 period as compared to the 2004 period. Property operating expenses increased due to portfolio wide increases in advertising and common area maintenance projects. Real estate taxes, which are also a part of property operating expenses, increased due to the COROC portfolio property values being revalued in several jurisdictions at the 2003 purchase price value. General and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million, or 8%, in the 2005 period as compared to the 2004 period. The increase is primarily due to compensation expense related to employee share options granted in the second quarter of 2004 and restricted shares granted in 2004 and 2005 all of which are accounted for under FAS 123. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses remained constant at 7% in both the 2005 and 2004 periods. Depreciation and amortization decreased from $50.7 million in the 2004 period to $48.2 million in the 2005 period. This was due principally to the accelerated depreciation and amortization of certain assets in the acquisition of the COROC properties in December 2003 accounted for under FAS 141 for tenants that terminated their leases during the 2004 period. Interest expense increased $7.8 million, or 22%, during the 2005 period as compared to the 2004 period due primarily to the $9.4 million prepayment premium and the write off of deferred loan costs totaling $447,000 incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 relating to the early extinguishment of the $77.4 million John Hancock Life Insurance Company mortgages. The increase in interest expense caused by this charge was partially offset by lower borrowings throughout the year prior to the acquisition of our interest in COROC in November 2005 and the related $250 million senior unsecured note issuance. In November 2005, we purchased our consolidated joint venture partners interest in COROC. Therefore, consolidated joint venture minority interest decreased $3.1 million due to less than a full year of allocation of earnings to our joint venture partner during 2005. The allocation of earnings to our joint venture partner was based on a preferred return on investment as opposed to their ownership percentage and accordingly had a significant impact on our earnings. Discontinued operations includes the results of operations and gains on sales of real estate for our Pigeon Forge, Tennessee and North Branch, Minnesota centers, both of which were sold in the first quarter of 2006. In 2004, we sold our Dalton, Georgia and Clover and LL Bean, New Hampshire properties. FAS 144 requires that all statements of operations presented be reclassified. The following table summarizes the results of operations and gains on sale of real estate for the 2005 and 2004 periods: Summary of discontinued operations 2005 2004 Operating income from discontinued operations $ 2,847 $ 2,104 Loss on sale of real estate (1,460 ) Discontinued operations $ 2,847 $ 644 During the first quarter of 2005, we sold our outlet center at our Seymour, Indiana property. Due to significant continuing involvement, the sale did not qualify as discontinued operations under the provisions of FAS 144. We recorded a loss on sale of real estate of $4.7 million as a result of the sale. Net proceeds received for the center were approximately $2.0 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.4 million, $83.9 million and $84.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to the incremental income from the COROC acquisition in November 2005. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 is due to a prepayment penalty of $9.4 million associated with the early extinguishment of the John Hancock Life Insurance Company mortgages in October 2005 offset by the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities amounted to $(62.8) million, $(336.6) million and $2.6 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and reflects the acquisitions, expansions and dispositions of real estate during each year. In 2006, we funded the majority of our 352,300 square foot outlet center developed in Charleston, South Carolina which opened in August 2006. In November 2005 we completed the acquisition of the final two thirds interest of the Charter Oak Partners portfolio of nine factory outlet centers totaling approximately 3.3 million square feet. We originally purchased a one third interest in December 2003. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities of $(20.0) million, $251.5 million and $(93.2) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, has fluctuated consistently with the capital needed to fund the current development and acquisition activity and reflects increases in distributions paid and units outstanding during 2006, 2005 and 2004. During 2005, together with the Company, we raised approximately $381.3 million in the public debt and equity markets in order to fund the acquisition described above and to repay the John Hancock Life Insurance mortgages. Current Developments and Dispositions Any developments or expansions that we, or a joint venture that we are involved in, have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled, or may not result in accretive net income or funds from operations. In addition, we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties. We may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties. Any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated, or if consummated, may not result in an increase in net income or funds from operations. WHOLLY OWNED CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS During August of 2006, we opened our wholly owned 352,300 square foot center located near Charleston, South Carolina. Tenants in the center include Gap, Banana Republic, Liz Claiborne, Nike, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, Guess, Reebok and others. As of December 31, 2006, the center was 89% occupied. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we closed on the acquisition of the Pittsburgh land for $4.8 million and have completed the relocation of the power lines located on our property. Tax incentive financing bonds have been issued, with net proceeds of approximately $16.8 million expected to be received by us as qualifying expenditures during construction of the center are incurred. We currently expect to deliver the first phase of the center, approximately 309,000 square feet, during the first quarter of 2008. The Pittsburgh center is wholly owned by us. During 2007, we plan to expand four centers by a combined 140,000 square feet. These centers are located in Barstow, California; Branson, Missouri; Gonzales, Louisiana and Tilton, New Hampshire. These expansions are projected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2007. WHOLLY OWNED DISPOSITIONS During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the sale of two outlet centers located in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee and North Branch, Minnesota. Net proceeds received from the sales of the centers were approximately $20.2 million. We recorded gains on sales of real estate of $13.8 million associated with these sales during the first quarter of 2006. CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES COROC Holdings, LLC On December 19, 2003, COROC Holdings, LLC, or COROC, a joint venture in which we had an initial one third ownership interest and consolidated for financial reporting purposes under the provisions of FIN 46R, purchased the 3.3 million square foot Charter Oak portfolio of outlet center properties for $491.0 million, including the assumption of $186.4 million of cross collateralized debt which has a stated, fixed interest rate of 6.59% and matures in July 2008. We recorded the debt at its fair value of $198.3 million, with an effective interest rate of 4.97%. Accordingly, a debt premium of $11.9 million was recorded and is being amortized over the life of the debt. We funded the majority of our share of the equity required for the transaction through the issuance of 4.6 million Company common shares on December 10, 2003, generating approximately $88.0 million in net proceeds. The results of the Charter Oak portfolio have been included in the consolidated financial statements from December 2003. In November 2005, we purchased for $286.0 million (including acquisition costs) the remaining two thirds interest from our joint venture partner. We recorded a debt discount of $883,000 with an effective interest rate of 5.25% to reflect the fair value of the debt deemed to have been acquired in the acquisition. The all cash transaction was funded with a combination of Company common and preferred shares and our unsecured senior notes. The transaction completed the Charter Oak acquisition and solidified our position in the outlet industry. In addition, the centers acquired provide an excellent geographic fit, a diversified tenant portfolio and are in line with our strategy of creating an increased presence in high end resort locations. UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES The following table details certain information as of December 31, 2006 about various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest: Joint Venture Center Location Opening Date Ownership % Square Feet Joint Venture Debt (in millions) TWMB Associates, LLC Myrtle Beach, South Carolina 2002 50% 401,992 $35.8 Tanger Wisconsin Dells, LLC Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin 2006 50% 264,929 $28.9 Deer Park Enterprise, LLC Deer Park, Long Island NY Under construction 33% 800,000 estimated $35.4 We may issue guarantees on the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise. This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment and in a higher return on our investment in the joint venture. We have joint and several guarantees for a portion of the debt outstanding for Tanger Wisconsin Dells and Deer Park Enterprise as of December 31, 2006. As is typical in real estate joint ventures, each of the above ventures contains provisions where a venture partner can trigger certain provisions and force the other partners to either buy or sell their investment in the joint venture. Should this occur, we may be required to incur a significant cash outflow in order to maintain ownership of these outlet centers. TWMB Associates, LLC TWMB Associates, LLC, or TWMB, a joint venture in which we have a 50% ownership interest, has operated a Tanger Outlet Center located on Highway 17 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina since June 2002. The Myrtle Beach center now consists of approximately 402,000 square feet and has over 90 name brand tenants. During March 2005, TWMB entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Bank of America with a notional amount of $35 million for five years. Under this agreement, TWMB receives a floating interest rate based on the 30 day LIBOR index and pays a fixed interest rate of 4.59%. This swap effectively changes the rate of interest on $35 million of variable rate mortgage debt to a fixed rate of 5.99% for the contract period. In April 2005, TWMB obtained non recourse, permanent financing to replace the construction loan debt that was utilized to build the outlet center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The new mortgage amount is $35.8 million with a rate of LIBOR + 1.40%. The note is for a term of five years with payments of interest only. In April 2010, TWMB has the option to extend the maturity date of the loan two more years until 2012. All debt incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property. Tanger Wisconsin Dells, LLC In March 2005, the Tanger Wisconsin Dells joint venture was established to construct and operate a Tanger Outlet center in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. During the first quarter of 2006, capital contributions of approximately $510,000 were made by each member. The 264,900 square foot center opened in August 2006. The tenants in the center include Polo Ralph Lauren, Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Liz Claiborne, Nike, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger and others. In February 2006, in conjunction with the construction of the center, Tanger Wisconsin Dells closed on a construction loan that provides for borrowings of up to $30.25 million with Wells Fargo Bank, NA due in February 2009. The construction loan is repayable on an interest only basis with interest floating based on the 30, 60 or 90 day LIBOR index plus 1.30%. The construction loan incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property as well as joint and several guarantees by us and designated guarantors of our venture partner. The above mentioned guarantee of the construction loan debt is accounted for under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, or FIN 45. FIN 45 requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee which represents the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur. The initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception. The recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payment will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements. We recorded at inception the fair value of our guarantee of the Tanger Wisconsin Dells joint ventures debt as an increase to our investment in Tanger Wisconsin Dells and recorded a corresponding liability of approximately $409,000. We have elected to account for the release from the obligation under the guarantee by the straight line method over the three year life of the guarantee. The remaining value of the guarantee liability as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $295,000. Deer Park Enterprise, LLC In October 2003, Deer Park Enterprise, LLC, or Deer Park, a joint venture in which we have a one third ownership interest, entered into a sale leaseback transaction for the location on which it ultimately will develop a shopping center that will contain both outlet and big box retail tenants in Deer Park, New York. To date, we have made equity contributions totaling $4.5 million to Deer Park, including $1.5 million in 2006. Both of the other venture partners have made equity contributions equal to ours. Demolition of the buildings located at the Deer Park site began during the third quarter of 2006 and we currently expect this center will contain over 800,000 square feet and will be delivered in the first quarter of 2008. In September 2006, Deer Park closed on a construction loan of $43.2 million with Bank of America which incurs interest at a floating interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.00% and is collateralized by the property as well as joint and several guarantees by all three venture partners. The loan balance as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $35.4 million. Proceeds to date were used to refinance the debt incurred in the original purchase of the property, including a $19 million loan with Bank of America and a $7 million purchase money mortgage note with the original seller of the property. The construction loan matures in April 2007. The above mentioned guarantee of the construction loan debt is accounted for under the provisions of FIN 45. We recorded at inception the fair value of our guarantee of the Deer Park joint ventures debt as an increase to our investment in Deer Park and recorded a corresponding liability of approximately $72,000. We have elected to account for the release from the obligation under the guarantee by the straight line method over the three year life of the guarantee. The remaining value of the guarantee liability as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $36,000. The original purchase of the property was in the form of a sale leaseback transaction, which consisted of the sale of the property to Deer Park for $29 million, including a 900,000 square foot industrial building, which was then leased back to the seller under an operating lease agreement. At the end of the lease in May 2005, the tenant vacated the building. However, the tenant had not satisfied all of the conditions necessary to terminate the lease. Deer Park is currently in litigation to recover from the tenant its monthly lease payments and will continue to do so until recovered. Annual rents due from the tenant were $3.4 million. Through March 2006, the Deer Park joint venture accounted for the lease revenues under the provisions of FASB Statement No. 67 Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, where the rent received from the tenant prior to May 2005 and that accrued from June 2005 through March 2006, net of applicable expenses, were treated as incidental revenues and were recorded as a reduction in the basis of the assets. Given the uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the litigation described above, Deer Park discontinued the accrual of rental revenues associated with the sale leaseback transaction as of April 1, 2006. As a result, we recorded our portion of the project losses, which amounted to $31,000 for the 2006 period, as a reduction in our investment in Deer Park and as a reduction to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures. Financing Arrangements In February 2006, the Company completed the issuance of an additional 800,000 Class C Preferred Shares, receiving net proceeds of approximately $19.4 million. The proceeds, which were contributed to us in exchange for preferred units, were used to pay down amounts outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit. The Company pays annual dividends equal to $1.875 per share with distributions from us. After the offering the total amount of Company Class C Preferred Shares (and Operating Partnership preferred units) outstanding was 3,000,000. All proceeds from common and preferred share issuances by the Company are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for common and preferred units. In August 2006, the Operating Partnership issued $149.5 million of exchangeable senior unsecured notes that mature on August 15, 2026. The notes bear interest at a fixed coupon rate of 3.75%. The notes are exchangeable into the Companys common shares, at the option of the holder, at an initial exchange ratio, subject to adjustment, of 27.6856 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an initial exchange price of $36.1198 per common share). The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Company on a senior unsecured basis. On and after August 18, 2011, holders may exchange their notes for cash in an amount equal to the lesser of the exchange value and the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged, and, at our option, Company common shares, cash or a combination thereof for any excess. Note holders may exchange their notes prior to August 18, 2011 only upon the occurrence of specified events. In addition, on August 18, 2011, August 15, 2016 or August 15, 2021, note holders may require us to repurchase the notes for an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. We used the net proceeds from the issuance to repay in full our mortgage debt outstanding with Woodman of the World Life Insurance Society totaling approximately $15.3 million, with an interest rate of 8.86% and an original maturity of September 2010. We also repaid all amounts outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit and a $53.5 million variable rate unsecured term loan with Wells Fargo with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.3%. As a result of the early repayment, we recognized a charge for the early extinguishment of the mortgages and term loan of approximately $917,000. The charge, which is included in interest expense, consisted of a prepayment premium of approximately $609,000 and the write off of deferred loan fees totaling approximately $308,000. At December 31, 2006, approximately 73% of our outstanding long term debt represented unsecured borrowings and approximately 57% of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered. We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in our unitholders best interests. During the third quarter of 2006, we, together with the Company, updated our shelf registration as a well known seasoned issuer where we will be able to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities on Form S 3. To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long term investment criteria. During the third quarter of 2006, we closed on unsecured lines of credit of $25 million each with Branch Banking and Trust Co. and SunTrust Bank. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained unsecured lines of credit that provided for unsecured borrowings of up to $200 million. All of our lines of credit have maturity dates of June 2009 or later. Based on cash provided by operations, existing credit facilities, ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during 2007. We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of distributions in order for the Company to maintain its status in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long term. Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi annually. Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce any outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Contractual Obligations 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Debt $ 3,791 $ 272,679 $ $ $ $ 399,500 $ 675,970 Operating leases 3,382 2,997 2,578 2,281 2,192 69,552 82,982 Preferred unit distributions (1) 5,625 5,625 5,625 80,625 97,500 Interest payments 41,782 36,801 25,544 20,981 20,981 145,594 291,683 $ 54,580 $ 318,102 $ 33,747 $ 103,887 $ 23,173 $ 614,646 $ 1,148,135 (1) Preferred unit distributions reflect cumulative distributions on our preferred units on which we pay an annual distribution of $1.875 per unit on the 3,000,000 outstanding preferred units as of December 31, 2006. The preferred units are redeemable from the Company to the extent that the Company redeems its Class C Preferred Shares for $25.00 per share after the respective optional redemption date. The future obligations include future distributions on preferred shares/units through the optional redemption date and the redemption amount is included on the optional redemption date. In addition to the contractual payment obligations shown in the table above, we also have a property under development and several in the process of being expanded or renovated. To complete these projects we expect to incur approximately $104.2 million of costs in 2007 and $20.3 million in 2008. The timing of these expenditures may vary due to delays in construction or acceleration of the opening date of a particular project. Our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios, including debt service coverage and leverage, and limit the payment of distributions such that distributions will not exceed funds from operations, as defined in the agreements, for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or 95% on a cumulative basis. We have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants; however, should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default, the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt. We currently maintain six unsecured credit facilities with major national banking institutions, totaling $200 million. As of December 31, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under these credit facilities. As of February 1, 2007, all six credit facilities will expire in June 2009 or later. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to a joint and several guarantee with respect to the construction loan obtained by Tanger Wisconsin Dells during the first quarter of 2006, which currently has a balance of $28.9 million. We are also party to a joint and several guarantee with respect to the loan obtained by Deer Park which currently has a balance of $35.4 million. See Joint Ventures section above for further discussion of off balance sheet arrangements and their related guarantees. Our pro rata portion of the TWMB mortgage secured by the center is $17.9 million. There is no guarantee provided for the TWMB mortgage by us. Related Party Transactions As noted above in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, we are 50% owners of the TWMB and Tanger Wisconsin Dells joint ventures. TWMB and Tanger Wisconsin Dells pay us management, leasing, marketing and development fees, which we believe approximate current market rates, for services provided to the joint ventures. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized approximately $410,000, $327,000 and $288,000 in management fees, $188,000, $6,000 and $212,000 in leasing fees, $86,000, $66,000 and $55,000 in marketing fees and $304,000, $0 and $28,000 in development fees, respectively. TFLP is a related party which holds a limited partnership interest in and is the minority owner of the Operating Partnership. Stanley K. Tanger, the Companys Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole general partner of TFLP. The only material related party transaction with TFLP is the payment of quarterly distributions of earnings which were $8.1 million, $7.8 million and $7.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in real estate joint ventures that represent non controlling ownership interests are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the provisions of FIN 46R, we were considered the primary beneficiary of our joint venture, COROC. Therefore, the results of operations and financial position of COROC were included in our Consolidated Financial Statements prior to November 2005 when we acquired the remaining two thirds interest in the joint venture. In 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R which clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The provisions of FIN 46R were effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities in 2004 and thereafter. We have evaluated Deer Park, Tanger Wisconsin Dells and TWMB and have determined that under the current facts and circumstances we are not required to consolidate these entities under the provisions of FIN 46R. Should certain facts and circumstances change and we were required to consolidated any or all of these entities under FIN 46R, it could have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. Acquisition of Real Estate In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 Business Combinations, or FAS 141, we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of land, building, tenant improvements, debt and deferred lease costs and other intangibles, such as the value of leases with above or below market rents, origination costs associated with the in place leases, and the value of in place leases and tenant relationships, if any. We depreciate the amount allocated to building, deferred lease costs and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to 40 years. The values of the above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease. The values of the below market leases that are considered to have renewal periods with below market rents are amortized over the remaining term of the associated lease plus the renewal periods. The value associated with in place leases is amortized over the remaining lease term and tenant relationships is amortized over the expected term, which includes an estimated probability of the lease renewal. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related deferred lease costs is written off. The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. If we do not allocate appropriately to the separate components of rental property, deferred lease costs and other intangibles or if we do not estimate correctly the total value of the property or the useful lives of the assets, our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may be significantly understated or overstated. Cost Capitalization In accordance with SFAS No. 91 Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leasesan amendment of FASB Statements No. 13, 60, and 65 and a rescission of FASB Statement No. 17, we capitalize all incremental, direct fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases, including certain general and overhead costs, as deferred charges. The amount of general and overhead costs we capitalize is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to executing these leases. We amortize these costs to expense over the estimated average minimum lease term. We capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties, including certain general and overhead costs and interest costs. The amount of general and overhead costs we capitalize is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets. Direct costs to acquire assets are capitalized once the acquisition becomes probable. If we incorrectly estimate the amount of costs to capitalize, we could significantly overstate or understate our financial condition and results of operations. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such an event, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the assets carrying amount, and if less, recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. If we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts, our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long lived assets. We believe that no impairment existed at December 31, 2006. Revenue Recognition Base rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on each tenants sales volume (percentage rentals) and reimbursement of the tenants share of advertising and promotion, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate tax expenses. Percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met. Expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized as revenue from the time payment is received until the tenant vacates the space. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, or FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. We have evaluated FIN 48 and currently do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, or SAB 108. SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement ("rollover") and balance sheet ("iron curtain") approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. If prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial now are considered material based on either approach, no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered. If prior years are not restated, the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 did not have an impact on our results from operations or financial position. Funds from Operations Funds from Operations, or FFO, represents income before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, any of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc., of which we are a member, has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry wide standard measure of REIT operating performance. In addition, a percentage of bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO performance. FFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: FFO does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; FFO does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and FFO does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; FFO does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters which may not be indicative of our ongoing operations; and Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our distribution paying capacity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only supplementally. See the Statements of Cash Flow included in our consolidated financial statements. Below is a reconciliation of FFO to net income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 as well as other data for those respective periods (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Funds from Operations: Net income $ 43,633 $ 6,077 $ 8,626 Adjusted for: Minority interest adjustment consolidated joint venture (315 ) (180 ) Depreciation and amortization attributable to discontinued operations 116 722 1,286 Depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate consolidated 56,938 47,917 50,492 Depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate unconsolidated joint ventures 1,825 1,493 1,334 (Gain) loss on sale of real estate (13,833 ) 4,690 1,460 Funds from operations (1) 88,679 60,584 63,018 Preferred unit distributions (5,433 ) (538 ) Funds from operations available to common unitholders $ 83,246 $ 60,046 $ 63,018 Weighted average common units outstanding (2) 18,574 17,341 16,650 (1) The years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 include gains on sales of outparcels of land of $402, $1,554 and $1,510, respectively. (2) Assumes the share and unit options are converted to common shares of the Company. Economic Conditions and Outlook The majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales (above predetermined levels, which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards) which generally increase as prices rise. Most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and advertising and promotion, thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. While factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers, some retail formats are more successful than others. As typical in the retail industry, certain tenants have closed, or will close, certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws. During 2007, we have approximately 1,548,000 square feet, or 18%, of our portfolio coming up for renewal. If we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms, the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We renewed 83% of the 1,760,000 square feet that came up for renewal in 2006 with the existing tenants at a 8% increase in the average base rental rate compared to the expiring rate. We also re tenanted 465,000 square feet during 2006 at a 17% increase in the average base rental rate. Existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong. The existing tenants have already renewed approximately 613,000, or 40%, of the square feet scheduled to expire in 2007 as of February 1, 2007. In addition, we continue to attract and retain additional tenants. Our factory outlet centers typically include well known, national, brand name companies. By maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the United States, we reduce our operating and leasing risks. No one tenant (including affiliates) accounts for more than 6% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues. Accordingly, we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, occupancy at our wholly owned, stabilized centers was 98% and 97%, respectively. Consistent with our long term strategy of re merchandising centers, we will continue to hold space off the market until an appropriate tenant is identified. While we believe this strategy will add value to our centers in the long term, it may reduce our average occupancy rates in the near term. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates. We may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis and to hedge anticipated future financings. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In September 2005, we entered into two forward starting interest rate lock protection agreements to hedge risks related to anticipated future financings in 2005 and 2008. The 2005 agreement locked the US Treasury index rate at 4.279% on a notional amount of $125 million for 10 years from such date in December 2005. This lock was unwound in the fourth quarter of 2005 in conjunction with the issuance of the $250 million senior unsecured notes due in 2015 and, as a result, we received a cash payment of $3.2 million. The gain was recorded in other comprehensive income and is being amortized into earnings using the effective interest method over a 10 year period that coincides with the interest payments associated with the senior unsecured notes due in 2015. The 2008 agreement locked the US Treasury index rate at 4.526% on a notional amount of $100 million for 10 years from such date in July 2008. In November 2005, we entered into an additional agreement which locked the US Treasury index rate at 4.715% on a notional amount of $100 million for 10 years from such date in July 2008. We anticipate unsecured debt transactions of at least the notional amount to occur in the designated periods. The fair value of the interest rate protection agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement. At December 31, 2006, we would have received approximately $743,000 if we terminated the agreements. If the US Treasury rate index decreased 1% and we were to terminate the agreements, we would have to pay $14.9 million to do so. The fair value is based on dealer quotes, considering current interest rates and remaining term to maturity. We do not intend to terminate the agreements prior to their maturity because we plan on entering into the debt transactions as indicated. During March 2005, TWMB, entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $35 million for five years to hedge floating rate debt on the permanent financing that was obtained in April 2005. Under this agreement, TWMB receives a floating interest rate based on the 30 day LIBOR index and pays a fixed interest rate of 4.59%. This swap effectively changes the rate of interest on $35 million of variable rate mortgage debt to a fixed rate debt of 5.99% for the contract period. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement. At December 31, 2006, TWMB would have received approximately $411,000 if the agreement was terminated. If the 30 day LIBOR index decreased 1% and TWMB were to terminate the agreement, TWMB would have to pay $634,000 to do so. The fair value is based on dealer quotes, considering current interest rates and remaining term to maturity. TWMB does not intend to terminate the interest rate swap agreement prior to its maturity. The fair value of this derivative is currently recorded as a liability in TWMBs balance sheet; however, if held to maturity, the value of the swap will be zero at that time. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to market risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of our total long term debt at December 31, 2006 was $715.7 million and its recorded value was $678.6 million. A 1% increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2006 would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately $46.8 million. Fair values were determined from quoted market prices, where available, using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity. The following table summarizes the notional values and fair values of our derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2006. Financial Instrument Type Notional Amount Rate Maturity Fair Value TANGER PROPERTIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP US Treasury Lock $100,000,000 4.526% July 2008 $ 967,000 US Treasury Lock $100,000,000 4.715% July 2008 $ (224,000 ) TWMB, ASSOCIATES, LLC LIBOR Interest Rate Swap (1) $35,000,000 4.59% March 2010 $ 411,000 (1) Amount represents fair value at TWMB Associates, LLC, in which we have a 50% ownership interest.
