ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations INTRODUCTION In this section, management discusses the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and expected future performance of the Company and its four primary business segments. The discussion applies to Peoples Energy and its business segments on a consolidated basis with the exception of the section titled Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas Discussions, which provides information specific to the Companys two regulated utility subsidiaries. Certain other results of operations and information specific to Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are also found in Item 1BusinessGas Distribution Segment and in this Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Managements discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. Unless otherwise noted, earnings per share are presented on a diluted basis. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Peoples Energy is a diversified energy company that conducts operations in four main business segments: Gas Distribution Oil and Gas Production Energy Marketing Energy Assets The Gas Distribution segment has the most significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial results. The remaining segments represent a portfolio of complementary energy businesses that the Company has developed to diversify the sources of consolidated operating income. The regulated gas distribution utilities, with service territories in Chicago and its northern suburbs, form the core of Peoples Energy. Until recently they have generated reliable earnings near the rate of return on equity allowed by the Commission, approximately 11%, since 1994. Fiscal 2006 operating results reflect continued erosion in Gas Distribution segment results, including a $107.3 million pre tax gas charge settlement, pursuant to Commission orders issued on March 28, 2006 that settled gas charge reconciliation proceedings for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Our two natural gas utilities, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, have not increased their delivery rates in eleven years, during which time operating costs have increased and throughput has declined. The business environment in which Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas operate benefits from a fundamentally strong economic base. The service territories are mature, and natural gas has a high penetration in its markets. However, gas usage per customer has declined steadily in recent years due to lower weather normalized demand primarily reflecting customer conservation. It is unclear how much of the load loss is permanent, but customers are reacting to higher bills by lowering their consumption. The diversified energy businesses use a low to moderate risk approach to develop assets and services that can provide long term growth and supplement the base of utility earnings. Since 1998, the contribution of operating income from the Companys diversified businesses has grown from an insignificant amount to $59.0 million (including $17.1 million in operating income from the discontinued operations of the power generation business) in fiscal 2006. The Company announced in February 2006 its intention to exit the power generation business. On January 31, 2006, the Company sold its 100% interest in the Valencia Energy power development site in New Mexico. On May 31, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 27% interest in the SCEP facility to Exelon Generation Company, LLC. On September 20, 2006, the Company announced that it signed an agreement with J POWER USA Development Co., Ltd. (J Power) to sell its 50% interest in the Elwood power generation facility and its 100% interest in a fully permitted power development site, the COB Energy Facility (COB), for $110 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. These sales will complete the divestiture of substantially all power assets owned by Peoples Energy. The Board of Directors of J Powers parent company approved the transactions on 30 November 30, 2006. Financial results for power generation are now being reported by Peoples Energy as discontinued operations. Through Elwood and COB, the Company owned approximately 700 net Megawatts of power generation assets. Merger. Pursuant to the definitive merger agreement entered into between Peoples Energy and WPS Resources on July 10, 2006, in August the companies jointly filed an application for approval of the merger with the Commission. Required regulatory approvals at the federal level, including those with the SEC, FERC, and Department of Justice, either have been or are expected to be received by December 31, 2006. Special shareholder meetings were held by both companies on December 6, 2006, to seek shareholder approval of the transaction. Shareholders of both WPS Resources and Peoples Energy approved the merger. The companies are targeting a closing date for the merger during the first calendar quarter of 2007. (See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the merger.) Rate Case. The Company announced in September 2005 that Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas planned to file delivery rate increases with the Commission. However, those plans have been postponed to allow Peoples Energy and WPS Resources to focus on gaining approvals for the merger. The companies are seeking expedited consideration of the application for approval of the merger by the Commission. The application indicates that Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas will further postpone filing rate cases until early 2007, with new rates to take effect in 2008 due to the normal 11 month rate case process in Illinois. Strategic Restructuring. In fiscal 2004 the Company took actions to improve the financial performance of its utilities by restructuring its utility and corporate support areas. The organizational restructuring targeted elimination of over 100 salaried positions, or about 10% of the Companys nonunion workforce. Overall, about 300 employees accepted the voluntary severance offer that accompanied the restructuring. (See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Earnings Outlook. Due to the pending merger with WPS Resources, Peoples Energy is not providing a specific earnings outlook for fiscal 2007 at this time. However, the Company expects some improvement in earnings, excluding the impact of merger related expenses, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Energy Marketing and Oil and Gas Production segments. Excluding the effects in fiscal 2006 of the gas charge settlement, Gas Distribution results are not likely to improve materially over fiscal 2006 absent increases in delivery rates, which are not expected before the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Key planning assumptions utilized by the Company for fiscal 2007 include normal weather based on a 10 year average of 6,175 degree days (representing a change from the Companys previous degree day planning assumption, which in fiscal 2006 utilized a 30 year average of 6,408 degree days), an average NYMEX gas price of $7.50 per MMbtu, a 2.25% utility bad debt rate, and higher expenses in the Gas Distribution and Corporate and Other segments. Capital expenditures are estimated at $250 million, with nearly half in the Gas Distribution segment and the remainder primarily in the Oil and Gas Production segment. No acquisitions have been budgeted in the Oil and Gas Production segment. Other assumptions include higher interest expense, a 35% effective tax rate, and slightly higher common shares outstanding. Financial Results Financial results for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 are summarized in the following table. Operating income for fiscal 2006 includes a $107.3 million pre tax charge ($1.68 per share after tax) for settlement of utility gas charge proceedings for fiscal years 2001 through 2004, as well as related civil litigation, and $8.9 million of expenses (pre tax) related to the Companys recently announced proposed merger with WPS Resources. Results for fiscal 2005 include $13.1 million in pension charges (pre tax) related to the Companys 2004 organizational restructuring. Income from discontinued operations relates to the Companys power generation business. Ongoing operating income (non GAAP) and ongoing income from continuing operations (non GAAP) are defined as GAAP operating income and GAAP income from continuing operations, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the fiscal 2006 settlement charge, merger expenses, and last years restructuring charge. Management believes that such measures of ongoing results are useful for year over year comparisons since charges of this 31 magnitude are infrequent and affect the comparability of operating results. Ongoing operating income and ongoing income from continuing operations are used internally to measure performance and in reports for management and the Companys Board of Directors.

In addition, fiscal 2006 utility deliveries were negatively impacted by 10% warmer than normal weather. Gas Distribution results were also negatively impacted by sharply higher operating expenses. Pursuant to the amended gas charge settlement, Hub revenues for the Gas Distribution segment in fiscal 2006 are being recorded as a credit to customers gas charges, negatively impacting year over year comparisons by $10.7 million. Oil and Gas Production volumes were up 2% for fiscal 2006 compared to a year ago. This improvement reflects strong performance of both existing and new wells and the impact of the Companys fiscal 2006 Will Drill acquisition, offset by the normal decline rate of existing production. Net realized prices increased sharply in fiscal 2006, partially offset by higher operating costs. Energy Marketing results were negatively impacted by an unrealized loss of $17.6 million for the year due to LOCOM inventory adjustments and MTM accounting of energy contracts, the impact of which was magnified by a significant decline in the market price of natural gas during the latter half of September 2006. Approximately $15 million of the year end impact from these adjustments is timing related and is expected to reverse over fiscal 2007. Year over year comparisons were negatively impacted by a $6.8 million gain in last years fourth quarter associated with the sale by Trigen Peoples District Energy (of which Peoples Energy owned a 50% interest) of its district heating and cooling plant in Chicago, which was reported in the Corporate and Other segment. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Statement of Operations Variations Fiscal 2006. The Companys revenues and cost of energy sold increased $418.4 million and $398.9 million, respectively. The increases are due to the impact of higher commodity prices at the Gas Distribution and Energy 32 Marketing segments as well as a 2% year over year increase in average daily production volumes and higher net realized prices at the Oil and Gas Production segment. These increases were partially offset by the impacts on the Gas Distribution segment of warmer weather and an estimated 4% decrease in deliveries resulting from customer conservation. Revenue comparisons were also adversely impacted by the change in the regulatory treatment of Hub revenue in the Gas Distribution segment. In fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a $107.3 million pretax charge related to a settlement of the Companys gas charge proceedings for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 approved by the Commission, as discussed in Notes 2C and 8A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, the Company recorded $8.9 million of costs incurred in connection with the Merger. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Merger. In fiscal 2005, the Company recorded $13.1 million in pension related charges resulting from its organizational restructuring commenced in the fall of fiscal 2004 (as described in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Utility environmental costs increased $3.2 million for fiscal 2006 and relate to investigation and remediation activities at multiple sites that formerly had operations for gas manufacturing and the storage of manufactured gas (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further discussion). These costs are recovered through the utilities rate mechanism and a similar amount is included in revenues, therefore these costs do not affect operating income. Operation and maintenance expense, excluding the above mentioned merger costs, environmental costs and restructuring related pension charges, increased $31.0 million. Significant items to note in fiscal 2006 were: Increased bad debt expense at the Gas Distribution segment of $6.5 million for fiscal 2006 due to high natural gas prices and their corresponding impact on revenues. Increased pension expense at Corporate and the Gas Distribution segment totaling $9.9 million due to lower discount rates. Increased direct labor costs at Corporate and the Gas Distribution segment totaling $4.6 million for fiscal 2006, primarily due to increases in wages and headcount. Increased lease operating, exploration and general and administrative costs at the Oil and Gas Production segment totaling $7.5 million. Rate case costs of $2.0 million expensed during fiscal 2006. Other Variances for 2006. DD&A increased $7.5 million in total and at the Oil and Gas Production segment increased $6.7 million, primarily due to the impacts of higher production and higher DD&A rates. Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $16.7 million primarily due to higher revenue taxes ($13.9 million) in the Gas Distribution segment due to higher revenues. Revenue taxes are recovered through the utilities rate mechanism and a similar amount included in revenues; therefore, these costs do not affect operating income. Equity investment income was $7.8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $10.3 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 results include the $7.8 million pretax gain associated with the first quarter sale of certain assets at the Companys EnerVest Energy, L.P. (EnerVest) partnership. Fiscal 2005 results include a $6.8 million gain related to the fourth quarter sale of assets by the Companys equity investment, Trigen Peoples District Energy (recorded in the Corporate and Other segment). Fiscal 2005 results also reflect a full year of equity investment income from both these investments. Interest expense increased $11.0 million due primarily to higher interest rates, higher short term borrowing balances, and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate adjustments. Income tax expense decreased $60.8 million primarily due to the charge for the amended settlement agreement related to the Companys gas charge proceedings and related tax benefit of $42.7 million. The effective tax rate on fiscal 2006 ongoing income (non GAAP), excluding the impact of the gas charge settlement and merger costs) was about 32%, down from 36% last year, due to the impact of lower income before taxes and federal Medicare subsidies excludable from taxable income. 33 Pre tax income from discontinued operations totaled $17.1 million for fiscal 2006 compared to $18.7 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 results included a $4.1 million pre tax gain from the sale of SCEP, a $1.8 million pre tax loss from the sale of the Valencia development site, and lower depreciation expense at Elwood. Fiscal 2005 results reflect a full year of SCEP equity investment income. Fiscal 2005. The Companys revenues and cost of energy sold increased $339.4 million and $337.6 million, respectively, in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The increases are due to higher commodity prices in the Gas Distribution segment and increased sales volumes in the Energy Marketing segment, partially offset by a 5.1% decrease in Gas Distribution deliveries resulting from warmer weather and ongoing conservation measures by utility customers. In addition, average daily production volumes at the Oil and Gas Production segment were down 12% compared to the prior year due to well performance, rig availability, and other timing delays. The Company recorded $13.1 million in pension related charges in fiscal 2005 resulting from its organizational restructuring commenced in 2004, compared to $17.0 million in restructuring costs recorded in fiscal 2004 (as described in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Utility environmental costs increased $13.1 million and relate to investigation and remediation activities at multiple sites that formerly had operations for gas manufacturing and the storage of manufactured gas. Operation and maintenance expense, excluding the above mentioned environmental costs and restructuring related pension charges, decreased $3.3 million. Significant items to note in fiscal 2005 were: Decreased direct labor costs primarily at Corporate and the Gas Distribution segment of $16.4 million as a result of the organizational restructuring. Exploration costs in the Oil and Gas Production segment decreased $5.1 million, reflecting a significant dry hole expense recognized in fiscal 2004. Lease operating expense and general and administrative expenses in the Oil and Gas Production segment increased $5.1 million in aggregate primarily as a result of a general increase in the cost of goods and services. Increased outside service expense of $3.7 million, much of which related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance work. Increased insurance, employee group insurance and other benefit expenses totaling $6.6 million. Other Variances for 2005. DD&A decreased $8.1 million mainly due to the $6.6 million impact of the approval by the Commission in April 2005 of new depreciation rates that reflect longer useful lives on utility plant (Commission Depreciation Order). The Oil and Gas Production segment also had lower DD&A expense ($1.6 million) in fiscal 2005. Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $14.3 million primarily due to higher revenue taxes in the Gas Distribution segment. Equity investment income increased $5.9 million primarily due to the $6.8 million gain related to the sale of assets by the Companys equity investment, Trigen Peoples District Energy. Interest expense increased $2.2 million due primarily to higher interest rates. Income tax expense increased $3.9 million as tax expense in fiscal 2004 was positively impacted by several items, including adjustments to accrued income taxes based on updated estimates of income tax liabilities and tax legislation which resulted in the Company realizing tax benefits from dividends reinvested in Peoples Energy stock under the Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, increased $4.5 million primarily due to the results of the Energy Assets segments Elwood facility, which included the Companys portion ($4.1 million) of a reduction in prior and current period expenses, primarily depreciation on generating equipment. 34 Segment Discussion A summary of the Companys operating income by segment, income from discontinued operations, and variations between periods, is presented below. For Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (In Thousands) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Operating income: Gas Distribution $ (12,724 ) $ 137,335 $ 141,158 $ (150,059 ) $ (3,823 ) Oil and Gas Production 31,097 16,853 41,537 14,244 (24,684 ) Energy Marketing 8,959 13,471 9,879 (4,512 ) 3,592 Energy Assets 1,766 1,727 1,575 39 152 Corporate and Other (27,312 ) (19,969 ) (41,120 ) (7,343 ) 21,151 Total operating income $ 1,786 $ 149,417 $ 153,029 $ (147,631 ) $ (3,612 ) Income from discontinued operations: Energy Assets Power generation $ 17,133 $ 18,760 $ 11,353 $ (1,627 ) $ 7,407 Corporate and Other (31 ) (31 ) (31 ) Less: income tax expense 6,797 7,444 4,500 (647 ) 2,944 Income from discontinued operations $ 10,305 $ 11,285 $ 6,822 $ (980 ) $ 4,463 Gas Distribution Segment. Revenues of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are directly impacted by fluctuations in weather because both companies have a large number of heating customers. Fluctuations in weather have the potential to significantly impact year to year comparisons of operating income and cash flow. Revenues of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are also affected by changes in the unit cost of the utilities gas purchases and do not include the cost of gas supplies for customers who purchase gas directly from producers and marketers. In a steady gas price environment, the unit cost of gas does not have a significant direct effect on operating income because the utilities tariffs provide for dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. (See Note 2K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) However, significant changes in gas costs can materially affect the reserve for uncollectible accounts, customer demand and working capital needs. Fiscal 2006 revenues for the Gas Distribution segment increased $233.2 million over 2005, primarily due to the impact of changes in commodity prices (an increase of $317 million) that are recovered on a dollar for dollar basis. This impact was partially offset by decreases in deliveries due to warmer weather ($21 million), lower weather normalized demand ($98 million) and by the impact of the change in the regulatory treatment of Hub revenues ($10.7 million) due to the amended settlement agreement. Operating income for fiscal 2006 decreased $150.1 million reflecting the impact of the amended settlement agreement. The $107.3 million in settlement charges recorded in fiscal 2006 and the $13.3 million liability recognized in prior periods reflect the following settlement amounts: $100 million in refunds to customers; $5 million related to the payment to the City and the AG pursuant to the settlement agreement; $10.7 million to reflect a change in regulatory treatment for fiscal 2005 Hub revenues; and an estimated $5 million net increase in bad debt expense primarily related to the termination of collection activities on approximately $207 million of bad debt written off during fiscal years 2000 2005. For fiscal 2006, ongoing (non GAAP) operating income was $94.6 million compared to $137.3 million last year. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of lower gas deliveries ($10.7 million), including an estimated 4% decline in weather normalized demand due to the impact of customer conservation, a weather insurance recovery recorded in fiscal 2005 ($3.5 million), the change in treatment of 2006 Hub revenues ($10.7 million), and higher operating expenses ($18.3 million). Weather for fiscal 2006 was 89 degree days or 2% warmer than last year. The increase in operating costs primarily reflected higher pension expenses ($7.7 million), labor related expenses 35 ($2.1 million), rate case costs ($2.0 million) and higher bad debt expense. Bad debt increased $6.5 million due to high natural gas prices and their corresponding impact on revenues. The bad debt accrual rate remained unchanged at approximately 2.25% of revenue. Fiscal 2005 revenues increased $186.6 million compared to fiscal 2004, primarily due to the impact on revenues of higher commodity prices ($221 million) that are recovered on a dollar for dollar basis. Partially offsetting this effect were decreases in deliveries due primarily to warmer weather ($31 million). Weather was 4% warmer compared to fiscal 2004. Operating income decreased $3.8 million compared with the previous year due to the effects of warmer weather ($5 million), lower weather normalized deliveries ($8 million), higher outside services expense ($3.0 million), the 2004 insurance recovery ($2.5 million) related to mercury cleanup costs incurred in prior years and increases in numerous other nonlabor expenses aggregating $11.3 million. Partially offsetting these negative variations are the effect of the fiscal 2004 accounts receivable adjustment ($6.9 million), decreased direct labor costs related to the organizational restructuring ($9.6 million), reduced depreciation expense ($6.6 million) as a result of the Commission Depreciation Order, and increased hub operating income ($2.2 million). 36 The following table summarizes revenue, deliveries and other statistics for the Gas Distribution segment.

Gross margin is the GAAP measure most closely related to net margin. Management believes net margin to be useful in understanding the Gas Distribution segments operations because the utility subsidiaries are allowed, under their tariffs, to recover gas costs, revenue taxes and environmental costs from their customers on a dollar for dollar basis. (2) Normal heating degree days for fiscal 2004 and 2005 are based on a 30 year average of monthly temperatures at Chicagos OHare Airport for the years 1970 1999. Normal heating degree days for fiscal 2006 are based on a 30 year average of monthly temperatures at Chicagos OHare Airport for the years 1975 2004. (3) Margin per Dth is based upon gas distribution and transportation activity and excludes the impact of hub revenues and hub volumes. 37 Oil and Gas Production Segment. Revenues and operating income for fiscal 2006 increased $26.1 million and $14.2 million, respectively, compared with the same period last year. The increase in revenue is due primarily to higher net realized commodity prices as older hedge positions continued to roll off and a 2% increase in equivalent average daily production. The improvement in production from a year ago reflects the results of the Companys 2006 drilling program and the impact of the February 2006 acquisition of properties from Will Drill Resources, Inc. (Will Drill), partially offset by the normal decline of existing production. Fiscal 2006 operating income results benefited from significantly higher net realized prices due to a lower percentage of gas volumes hedged (71% compared to nearly 100% a year ago), a small increase in production, and higher results from the Companys EnerVest partnership, which benefited from a $7.8 million pretax gain associated with the sale of assets. Last years net realized price was negatively impacted by an $8.4 million hedge ineffectiveness charge resulting from wider than normal differentials between NYMEX and wellhead prices primarily due to the impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The improvements in production and realized commodity prices were partially offset by higher operating costs ($17.3 million), most notably higher general and administrative expense ($6.0 million) and depletion expenses ($6.7 million). In fiscal 2006, the Company drilled 58 wells (11 related to the Will Drill acquisition) with a success rate of 93%. Fiscal 2005 revenues and operating income decreased $23.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively, compared with fiscal 2004 due mainly to lower production volumes and oil and gas hedge ineffectiveness ($8.4 million). Hedge ineffectiveness was primarily due to the impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the price differentials between NYMEX and field prices. On an equivalent basis, average daily production volumes declined 12% compared to the prior year due to well performance, rig availability, and other timing delays. Increases in lease operating expense ($3.7 million) and lower equity investment income from the Companys investment in EnerVest ($1.3 million), higher production taxes (associated with higher wellhead gas prices) and administrative costs ($1.5 million) also reduced operating income comparisons to fiscal 2004. These negative impacts on operating income were partially offset by lower DD&A expense ($1.6 million) and lower exploration expense ($5.1 million) compared to the previous year. The following table summarizes hedges in place as of October 1, 2007 for the Oil and Gas Production segment. Fiscal 2007 Gas hedges in place (MMbtus) 12,705,000 Gas hedges as a percent of estimated fiscal production 50 % Percent of gas hedges that are swaps 63 % Average swap price ($/MMbtu) $ 5.37 Percent of gas hedges that are no cost collars 37 % Weighted average floor price ($/MMbtu) $ 5.62 Weighted average ceiling price ($/MMbtu) $ 6.72 Oil hedges in place (MBbls) 182 Oil hedges as a percent of estimated fiscal production 63 % Average hedge price ($/Bbl) $ 37.50 38 The following table summarizes operating statistics from the Oil and Gas Production segment.

The increase in the 2006 DD&A rate was caused by production mix and the addition of unproven capital and costs associated with the development of both proven and unproven reserves. On February 23, 2006 the Company announced that it had acquired certain oil and gas properties in eastern Texas, northern Louisiana and Mississippi from Will Drill for approximately $139 million. The acquired properties, virtually all of which are now operated by the Company, consist of approximately 60,000 gross acres in 33 fields in the heart of the Cotton Valley / Travis Peak (Hosston) gas trend. The acquisition initially added approximately 7.5 MMcfed to existing production and an estimated 59 Bcfe of proven reserves. Approximately 47% of the acquired reserves are developed. The Will Drill acquisition added 4.8 MMcfed to the annual average production. The Company expects to spend approximately $60 million of drilling capital on the acquired properties in fiscal 2007. During April 2005, the Company acquired properties in South Texas for approximately $6 million. Although there was minimal production at the time of acquisition, these properties are providing current and future drilling opportunities. On July 30, 2004, the Company acquired certain oil and gas properties in eastern Texas from a private entity for approximately $10 million. Initial development of the acquired reserves began in fiscal 2005 with capital spending on these properties totaling $19.8 million. The acquired properties, which are operated by the Company, are located in close proximity to the existing Peoples Energy Production holdings in eastern Texas. On December 31, 2003, the Company acquired, through a series of transactions, certain oil and gas properties located in Texas for approximately $33.1 million. The acquired reserves, 88% of which are natural gas, contributed approximately 3.3 MMcfe per day of production to the Companys fiscal 2004 production. The majority of the acquired properties are located adjacent to or in close proximity to existing holdings of the Company, and each of the acquired properties is operated by the Company. Energy Marketing Segment. Revenues for fiscal 2006 increased $155.2 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by a decline in gas volumes sold. Operating income for fiscal 2006 was $9.0 million compared to $13.5 million in fiscal 2005. Energy Marketings margins can be volatile and are small in relation to the market value of the commodity. As a result, revenue statistics are not necessarily indicative of Energy Marketing operating income results. Retail results declined from a year ago due primarily to LOCOM and MTM accounting adjustments of energy contracts, the impact of which was magnified by a significant decline in the market price of natural gas during the latter half of September 2006, as well as higher operating expenses, partially due to higher sales and marketing expenses associated with customer growth. Lower retail results were 39 partially offset by higher wholesale marketing results, reflecting additional pipeline and storage capacity under contract and the positive impact of price volatility and spreads on storage and transportation optimization strategies, partially offset by LOCOM adjustments and MTM accounting. For the year, the number of retail customers increased approximately 60% from a year ago, to almost 41,000, as Energy Marketing expanded its customer base in Michigan and Ohio. Retail gas deliveries declined slightly to 48 Bcf, while electric deliveries increased 24% to 1.7 million Mwh from 1.4 million Mwh a year ago. LOCOM inventory loss adjustments ($16.3 million), fair value hedge accounting losses ($3.2 million), ineffectiveness gains ($0.6 million) and MTM accounting gains ($1.3 million) resulted in an unrealized loss for the Energy Marketing segment of $17.6 million for fiscal 2006. This net unrealized loss includes both MTM activity of hedges for settlement in future periods and settled within the current period, as well as LOCOM inventory loss adjustments that are expected to reverse when the gas inventory is sold pursuant to existing contracts. Approximately $15 million of the year end impact (net) is expected to reverse over the course of the next fiscal year and relates primarily to the LOCOM adjustment of $16.3 million. The earnings variability resulting from accounting timing can be significant from period to period, even when the underlying economic position is unchanged. The Company uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the profit margin that it will ultimately realize when inventory volumes are withdrawn from storage. Under fair value hedge accounting, which Energy Marketing is using for certain storage activity, the MTM adjustment to inventory is computed using spot prices, while the derivatives used to mitigate the risk of changes in inventory value are marked to market using forward prices. When the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price, the difference is recorded in operating results. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility, even when the underlying expected profit margin over the duration of the contracts is unchanged. The volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period. Revenues for fiscal 2005 increased $173.7 million primarily due to higher retail and wholesale commodity prices and volumes. Operating income improved $3.6 million, driven by higher retail margins, higher load and lower operating costs, partially offset by a $3.3 million MTM loss related to the application of fair value hedge accounting to certain storage inventory transactions. The following table summarizes operating statistics for the Energy Marketing segment. For Fiscal Years Ended September 30, (In Thousands, Except Customers) 2006 2005 2004 Wholesale gas volumes sold (MDth) 48,160 56,391 52,815 Retail gas volumes sold (Dth) 48,289 49,923 47,965 Number of retail gas customers 37,084 23,389 24,744 Retail electric volumes sold (Mwh) 1,727 1,397 1,113 Number of electric customers 3,380 2,268 1,901 Energy Assets Segment. All financial results relating to power generation formerly included in this business segment are now reported as discontinued operations, including prior year results. Operating income for the Energy Assets segment reflects the Companys natural gas liquids (NGL) peaking facility, a 40 mile refinery gas pipeline, 250 acres of land and related facilities, and certain limited business development expenses related to ongoing asset investment opportunities. Revenues for fiscal 2006 increased $4.1 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices and increased volumes associated with activity at the Companys propane based peaking facility. Fiscal 2006 operating income of $1.8 million was flat compared to fiscal 2005. Discontinued Operations. The Company announced in February 2006 its intention to exit the power generation business. On January 31, 2006, the Company sold its 100% interest in the Valencia Energy power development site in New Mexico. On May 31, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its 27% interest in the SCEP facility to Exelon Generation Company, LLC. On September 20, 2006, the Company announced that it signed an agreement 40 with J Power to sell its 50% interest in the Elwood power generation facility and its 100% interest in a fully permitted power development site, the COB Energy Facility (COB), for $110 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. These sales will complete the divestiture of substantially all power assets owned by Peoples Energy. The Board of Directors of J Powers parent company approved the transactions on November 30, 2006. Financial results for power generation are now being reported by Peoples Energy as discontinued operations. Through Elwood and COB, the Company owned approximately 700 net Megawatts of power generation assets. Fiscal 2006 income from discontinued operations for the Energy Assets segment decreased $1.6 million (before taxes) due to the absence of equity investment income from SCEP and the $1.8 million loss on the sale of the Valencia development site, partially offset by the $4.1 million gain on the sale of SCEP. Amortization of capitalized interest related to the construction of the Elwood power generation facility was formerly included in the Corporate and Other segment. Fiscal 2005 income from discontinued operations for the Energy Assets segment increased $7.4 million (before taxes) from the prior year largely as a result of lower depreciation expense impact on equity investment income for the Elwood facility and lower other expenses. In connection with its fiscal 2004 year end audit, the Elwood partnership determined that depreciation expense related to current and prior periods should be adjusted, primarily to recognize greater salvage value of its generating equipment. This adjustment positively impacted fiscal 2005 results by $4.1 million, of which $2.2 million related to prior periods. The electric capacity of Elwood Energy LLC (Elwood) has been sold through long term contracts with Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Exelon), Engage Energy America LLC (Engage) and Aquila, Inc. (Aquila). Effective December 31, 2004, the contract with Engage terminated and the related electric capacity is being purchased by Exelon. On June 15, 2006, Aquila assigned its Elwood power sales agreement to Constellation Energy Commodities Group, Inc, a subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group, Inc. In August 2006, S&P and Moodys ratings on Elwoods bonds were upgraded to BB and Ba1, respectively, with a stable outlook. Corporate and Other Segment. The operating loss for fiscal 2006 increased $7.3 million and includes $8.9 of merger related expenses. Results for fiscal 2005 included $13.1 million in restructuring charges. Absent these costs, corporate and other expenses increased $11.5 million due primarily to a $6.8 million gain in fiscal 2005 associated with the sale of certain assets by Trigen Peoples District Energy (of which Peoples Energy owned a 50% interest) and higher legal ($2.4 million) and incentive benefit expenses ($3.4 million). The operating loss for fiscal 2005 decreased $21.2 million primarily due to direct labor savings of $6.8 million as a result of the restructuring, the $6.8 million gain resulting from the sale of the Trigen Peoples district heating and cooling plant, and a $3.9 million decrease in costs resulting from the 2004 organizational restructuring. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Companys financial statements using GAAP, management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions. Management considers its critical accounting policies to be those that are important to the representation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. They require managements most difficult and subjective or complex judgments, including those that could result in materially different amounts if the Company reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The Company discusses its critical accounting policies, as well as other accounting policies, with senior members of management and the Audit Committee, as appropriate. There were no material changes in the application of each of the critical accounting policies listed below during fiscal 2006. (See Note 2O of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.) Regulated Operations. Due to the regulation of the Companys utility subsidiaries, certain transactions are recorded based on the accounting prescribed in SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain incurred costs that will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers. Accordingly, actions of the Commission could have an effect on the amount recovered from or refunded to customers. Any 41 differences between recoverable and refundable amounts and the amounts deferred would be recorded as income or expense at the time of any Commission action (see Notes 2C and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the gas charge settlement). If all or a reportable portion of the utility operations becomes no longer subject to the provision of SFAS No. 71, a write off of related regulatory assets or liabilities would be required, unless some form of transition cost recovery continued through rates established and collected for the remaining regulated operations. No such change is foreseen by management. (See Note 2K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of regulatory assets and liabilities recorded under this policy.) Environmental Activities Relating to Former Manufactured Gas Operations. The Companys utility subsidiaries, their predecessors, and certain former affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple sites for the purpose of manufacturing gas and storing manufactured gas (manufactured gas sites). The utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs they incur in connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas sites pending recovery through rates or from other entities. The amounts deferred include costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and managements best estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites. Managements estimates are based upon a probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative and remedial costs. Management considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs, and the extent of recovery from other PRPs. (See Notes 2K and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for deferred environmental costs recorded as regulatory assets and a discussion of environmental matters.) Retirement and Postretirement Benefits. The calculation of pension expense relies on actuarial assumptions including discount rate, long term rate of return on assets and assumed future increases in compensation. These assumptions are determined annually and changes to the assumptions can have a material effect on the amounts recorded from year to year. The Company bases its discount rate assumption on yields of high quality long term, fixed income bonds. A decrease in the assumed discount rate of 25 basis points would have increased fiscal 2006 pension expense by $1.3 million. Additionally, when an employee retires and takes his/her retirement benefit as a lump sum, a settlement amount under SFAS No. 88 is calculated representing a portion of unrecognized gains and losses. The Company has chosen to record this amount in the current period instead of amortizing the difference over the expected average service life of the remaining participants. Both methods are acceptable under GAAP. Therefore, the timing of retirements can have an effect on the amount recorded in any given year. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for current year assumptions.) In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all employees may become eligible for such benefit coverage if they reach retirement age while working for the Company. Through the use of an independent actuary, the Company accrues the expected costs of such benefits during a portion of the employees years of service. This accrual is based on assumptions regarding discount rates, rate of return on assets and health care cost trend rates. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point for each future year would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at September 30, 2006, by $12.9 million and the aggregate of service and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $2.1 million annually. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point for each future year would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at September 30, 2006, by $11.2 million and the aggregate of service and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $1.7 million annually. A decrease in the assumed discount rate of 25 basis points would have increased postretirement benefit cost expense by $0.4 million. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for current year assumptions.) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company enters into financial derivative contracts to hedge price risk on natural gas and oil purchases and sales. For each contract, management must determine whether the underlying transaction qualifies as a hedge under derivative accounting rules prescribed in SFAS No. 42 133. If contracts do qualify as hedges, they have the effect of reducing, but not completely eliminating, volatility in earnings. For contracts not qualifying as hedges, the change in the fair value of these contracts is recorded in income monthly and results in potentially significant impacts, both positive and negative. Additionally, due to the nature of the Companys businesses, many of the Companys contracts for physical purchases and sales of gas, oil or power meet the definition of a derivative, but are exempt from derivative accounting requirements under the normal purchases and sales exemption. Under this exemption, if the transactions are clearly intended to meet the requirements of customers, MTM accounting is not required. Management judgment is required to make this determination. The application of hedge accounting and the normal purchase and sales exemption is also subject to contemporaneous documentation requirements under SFAS No. 133. The Company also manages its levels of floating and fixed rate interest payments within a specified range through the use of derivative financial instruments. (See Note 2L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys cash flow and fair value hedging strategies and the MTM derivative instruments.) Provision for Uncollectible Accounts. The Companys subsidiaries accrue for estimated uncollectible accounts as revenues are recorded. The accrual rates are established based upon historical experience and projections of future charge offs resulting from various factors, including the impacts of natural gas prices and weather. Each quarter, the Companys subsidiaries update the projection of future charge offs based upon the most current information available, and adjust the reserve for uncollectible accounts, if necessary. Depreciation, depletion and amortization. The Companys provision for depreciation at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas substantially reflects the systematic amortization of the original cost of depreciable property, net of the accumulated reserve for depreciation, over the estimated composite remaining useful lives on the straight line method. Additionally, actual dismantling cost, net of salvage, is recorded as depreciation expense in the month incurred. The depreciation rates of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are subject to periodic review by the Commission, which approves the depreciation rates used for rate making purposes. Diversified businesses depreciable properties, other than oil and gas producing properties, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. In the case of oil and gas producing properties, the Company is amortizing associated capitalized costs by utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting on the units of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. The successful efforts method provides for properties to be aggregated into cost centers, or pools, with depreciation, depletion and amortization calculated on a pool by pool basis. These pools are comprised of properties in an area that share the same general geological characteristics. Unit of production amortization rates and the aggregation of properties into pools are reviewed at least once a year or whenever there is an indication of the need for revision. Those revisions are accounted for prospectively as changes in accounting estimates. Acquisition costs are amortized over total proved reserves. Development costs are amortized over total proved developed reserves. Costs to be amortized include all capitalized costs (less accumulated amortization) and estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage. The cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects are excluded from the amortization base. These costs and resulting proved reserves are transferred into the amortization base or expensed at the point when a determination can be made about the projects success. (See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for supplemental disclosures of the Companys Oil and Gas Production segment.) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following is a summary of cash flows for the Company: For Fiscal Years Ended September 30, (In Thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 131,162 $ 282,152 $ 202,292 Net cash used in investing activities $ (340,265 ) $ (156,190 ) $ (164,763 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 233,032 $ (115,004 ) $ (43,949 ) Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2006 decreased as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the decrease in net income resulting from the impact of the gas charge settlement refund (see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and other factors described above under Results of Operations, partially offset by favorable net changes in working capital. In the accompanying cash flow statements, balance sheet changes in current deferred tax assets, gas in storage and deposits with broker or trustee exclude certain noncash transactions (primarily the effects of MTM accounting). Changes in gas in storage reflect lower of cost or market adjustments. Additionally, balance sheet changes in intercompany assets/liabilities of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas exclude the noncash effects of derivative activity conducted on their behalf by Peoples Energy. Net cash used in investing activities increased as a result of an increase in capital spending, primarily in the Oil and Gas Production segment. On February 23, 2006, the Company announced that it had acquired certain oil and gas properties in eastern Texas, northern Louisiana and Mississippi from Will Drill for approximately $139 million. Increases in the return of capital from the Companys equity method investments, primarily related to the sale of properties by the EnerVest partnership and the Trigen Peoples partnership, as well as through the sale of the Companys interest in the SCEP facility which resulted in proceeds of approximately $47 million, were largely offset by an increase in deposits associated with the Companys commodity hedging activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to additional commercial paper borrowing ($301.6 million) in fiscal 2006, partially related to the Oil and Gas Production segment acquisition, compared to commercial paper retirement ($47.5 million) in fiscal 2005. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2005 increased due to favorable net changes in working capital. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 decreased compared to 2004 as a result of decreased capital spending primarily in the Oil and Gas Production segment offset by an increase in deposits associated with the Companys commodity hedging activities driven by price declines and ratings downgrades on Company long term debt. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to increased retirements of commercial paper, lower amounts of debt issued (net of retirements) and to lower amounts of common stock issued under the continuous equity program and the LTIC Plan in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the discussion of major balance sheet variations below for more detail. Balance Sheet Variations Total assets at September 30, 2006, increased $284.6 million as compared to September 30, 2005, due to additional capital investment in the Oil and Gas Production segment resulting from the Will Drill acquisition, increases in current regulatory assets related primarily to MTM accounting for the utility gas costs hedging program, and increases in noncurrent regulatory assets and capital investments in the Gas Distribution segment resulting from the recognition of asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47. These increases were partially offset by decreases in derivative assets that are marked to market and largely relate to utility hedge activity. The decrease in derivative assets reflects price declines during fiscal 2006 relative to utility supply contracts (long positions). Current liabilities increased due to additional levels of commercial paper outstanding (primarily due to the oil and gas properties acquisition) and an increase in gas costs refundable through rate adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in accrued taxes due to lower taxable income and by a decrease in regulatory liabilities largely corresponding with the above decrease in derivative assets that are marked to market. 44 Settlement of these assets is included as an adjustment to gas costs included in customer bills. Deferred credits and other liabilities increased due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47. The increase in the Companys capitalization was the result of the combined decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss and increase in common stock (primarily issued through the Direct Purchase and Investment Plan and the LTIC Plans), partially offset by the reduction in retained earnings, due primarily to the $64.7 million after tax charge related to the gas charge settlement and dividend payments of $83.7 million. The decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects both price declines related to short position derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges at the Companys Oil and Gas Production and Energy Marketing segments and a net decrease in derivative positions at the Oil and Gas Production segment. Financial Sources The Company and Peoples Gas have access to outside capital markets, commercial paper markets and internal sources of funds that together provide sufficient resources to meet their working capital and long term capital requirements. North Shore Gas has access to outside capital markets to meet long term capital requirements and uses internal sources of funds and loans from the Company and Peoples Gas to meet working capital needs. Changes that could materially alter its liquidity position include the effect of high gas prices on utility working capital and on hedge related margin requirements for the upcoming heating season. The Company maintains lines of credit facilities to ensure sufficient liquidity for seasonal working capital requirements and other short term financial needs. As forecasts of liquidity change throughout the year (due to high gas prices, for example), the Company may seek additional sources of liquidity in order to meet its objectives. Due to the seasonal nature of gas usage, a major portion of the utilities cash collections occurs between January and June. Because of timing differences in the receipt and disbursement of cash and the level of construction requirements, the utility subsidiaries borrow from time to time on a short term basis. Short term borrowings are repaid with cash from operations or other short term borrowings or are refinanced on a permanent basis with debt or equity, depending on market conditions and capital structure considerations. In addition to cash generated internally by operations, as of September 30, 2006, the Company and its subsidiaries had committed credit facilities of $650 million (Peoples Energy, $400 million; Peoples Gas, $250 million). These facilities primarily support the Companys and Peoples Gas ability to borrow using commercial paper. As of September 30, 2006, $89.6 million of Peoples Energys $400 million line and all of Peoples Gas $250 million facilities were available. The Peoples Energy $400 million credit agreement expires in June 2011, and the Peoples Gas $250 million credit agreement expires in July 2010. The long term credit facilities are expected to be renewed when they expire, although the exact amount of the renewals will be evaluated at that time and may change from the current levels. North Shore Gas intends to meet its future short term borrowing requirements through loans from Peoples Energy or Peoples Gas. The Companys and Peoples Gas credit facilities generally contain debt triggers that permit the lenders to terminate the credit commitments to the borrowing company and declare any outstanding amounts due and payable if the borrowing companys consolidated debt to total capital ratio, excluding the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), exceeds 65%. At September 30, 2006, the Companys total debt was 59% of total debt plus equity (58% excluding AOCI), up from 53% a year ago due primarily to the impacts of the settlement charge and the Will Drill oil and gas acquisition. Anticipated proceeds from the sale of the Companys remaining power generation assets by calendar year end will be used to reduce short term borrowing. The current debt to total capital ratio for Peoples Gas is 44% (44% excluding AOCI). Management does not expect the gas reconciliation settlement to have a material adverse affect on the Companys liquidity or its ability to fund its strategic initiatives and capital expenditures. In addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above, the Company has uncommitted lines of credit and letters of credit backup of $25.0 million, of which $2.0 million was used for letters of credit backup and $23.0 million was unused as of September 30, 2006. Peoples Gas and North Shore have the ability to loan up to 45 $50 million between the two utilities and to borrow up to $150 million and $50 million, respectively, from Peoples Energy. As of September 30, 2006, there were no loans from Peoples Energy to Peoples Gas or North Shore Gas. As of September 30, 2006, there were no loans between Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The current credit ratings for the Company, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are summarized in the table below. Corporate Credit Rating Company Senior Unsecured Debt Peoples Gas/ North Shore Gas Senior Secured Debt Company Commercial Paper Peoples Gas Commercial Paper Moodys n/a Baa2 A1 P 2 P 1 Standard and Poors A BBB+ A A 2 A 2 Moodys describes double A rated debt (Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3) as high grade and single A rated debt (A1, A2 and A3) as upper medium grade. S&P describes A rated debt (A+, A and A ) as strong and triple B rated debt (BBB+, BBB and BBB ) as adequate. The lowest investment grade credit ratings for Moodys is Baa3 and for S&P is BBB . Thus, both credit rating agencies give the Company, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas investment grade ratings. Regarding short term ratings applicable to commercial paper, Moodys describes the P 1 rating as indicating a superior repayment ability and P 2 as indicating a strong repayment ability. S&P describes an A 2 rating as satisfactory. Changes in Credit Lines and Debt Securities On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into (1) a $25 million revolving credit agreement with ABN AMRO Bank, N.V.; (2) a $25 million revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A.; and (3) a $25 million revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank to provide for potential seasonal liquidity needs. Each credit agreement is effective from October 20, 2006 through the earlier of (i) March 31, 2007 or (ii) the consummation of the merger between a subsidiary of WPS Resources Corporation and Peoples Energy. Funds may be used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back up. On June 13, 2006, the Company and various institutions entered into a $400 million 5 year syndicated revolving credit agreement. The credit agreement is effective through June 13, 2011 and funds may be used for general corporate purposes. The credit agreement supports the Companys commercial paper borrowing program. This credit agreement replaces the previous $225 million credit facility dated March 8, 2004 that was scheduled to expire in March 2007. On July 12, 2005, Peoples Gas entered into a 5 year syndicated revolving credit agreement with eleven financial institutions that provides backup for Peoples Gas seasonal commercial paper borrowing program. The maximum amount that may be borrowed under the credit agreement is $250 million. This replaces the previous $200 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2005. During fiscal 2005 the Company refinanced $50 million of Peoples Gas debt. (See Note 14A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of fiscal 2005s refinancing activity.) Changes in Equity Securities The Company has filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 for the issuance from time to time of up to 1.5 million shares of common stock pursuant to a continuous equity offering in one or more negotiated transactions or at the market offerings. As of September 30, 2006, a total of 1,235,700 shares of common stock had been issued through the continuous equity offering. In fiscal 2004, 377,400 shares were issued, resulting in proceeds of $15.5 million, net of issuance costs. During fiscal 2005 and 2006 and through the date of filing the Companys Form 10 K with the SEC, the Company has not issued any additional shares under this registration 46 statement. However, the Company did issue common stock through its LTIC Plan, Direct Purchase and Investment Plan, DDC Plan, DSOP and its ESPP. (See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) During fiscal 2006, Peoples Gas issued 540,000 shares of its common stock to the Company for $53.9 million. Financial Uses Capital Spending. In fiscal 2006, the Companys capital expenditures totaled $344.0 million, including $0.6 million related to assets of discontinued operations. The Gas Distribution segment spent $101.6 million on property, plant and equipment, of which $92.2 million related to Peoples Gas and $9.4 million to North Shore Gas. Capital expenditures at the Oil and Gas Production segment on the acquisition of reserves, drilling projects and the exploitation of the acquired and existing assets totaled $236.4 million. Management currently estimates that capital spending for fiscal 2007 will total approximately $250 million. Dividends. The Companys dividends have not changed since February 4, 2005, when the Companys Board of Directors voted to raise the regular quarterly dividend on the Companys common stock from 54 cents per share to 54 1/2 cents per share. The first payment at this new level was made on April 15, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 22, 2005. Interest Coverage The fixed charges coverage ratios for the Company, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are as follows: For Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 Peoples Energy 0.52 3.23 3.29 Peoples Gas (1.28 ) 4.20 4.30 North Shore Gas 3.58 5.87 5.83 The decrease in the ratio for the Company in fiscal 2006 from 2005 reflects higher interest rates, lower pretax income, due primarily to the settlement charge in fiscal 2006, and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate adjustments. The decrease in the ratio in fiscal 2005 from 2004 reflects higher interest rates in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the ratio for Peoples Gas in fiscal 2006 from 2005 reflects higher interest rates, lower pretax income, due primarily to the settlement charge in fiscal 2006, and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate adjustments. The decrease in the ratio in fiscal 2005 from 2004 reflects higher interest rates in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the ratio for North Shore Gas in fiscal 2006 from 2005 and 2004 levels reflects lower pretax income, due primarily to the settlement charge in fiscal 2006, and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate adjustments. Commitments and Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. Off balance sheet debt at September 30, 2006 and 2005, consists of the Companys pro rata share of nonrecourse debt of various equity investments, including EnerVest (zero and $2.9 million) and Elwood ($165.1 million and $174.3 million). The Company believes this off balance sheet financing will not have a material effect on the Companys future financial condition. The Company also has commercial obligations of $34.6 million in guarantees, $6.7 million in letters of credit, $1.6 million in surety bonds and $35.2 million in operating leases at September 30, 2006. (See Notes 5 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further descriptions and details of the Companys off balance sheet arrangements.) 47 Contractual Obligations. The Company has certain contractual obligations directly related to the Companys operations and unconsolidated equity investees. The majority of these are guarantees of debt service and performance (related to unconsolidated equity investees), as well as substantial commitments for gas supply, transportation and storage. (See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The following table summarizes the Companys long term minimum contractual obligations.

The adjustable rate interest is calculated based on the indexed rate in effect at September 30, 2006. (2) Includes gas purchases, storage, transportation, information technology related and miscellaneous long term and short term capital purchase commitments. (3) Minimum pension funding is an estimate of the contributions that would be required pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to fund benefits earned as of October 1, 2006. Additional contributions may be made to fund benefits accruing after October 1, 2006, or on a discretionary basis. Merger. In the event that the pending merger with WPS Resources is successfully completed, the Company will recognize expenses estimated to total approximately $14 million in addition to expenses recognized in fiscal 2006. These payments are for transaction fees and other costs, as well as additional compensation expense resulting from the change in control provisions in the Companys long term incentive plans. (See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the termination fees and related expenses in the event the merger is not completed. Environmental Matters. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are conducting environmental investigations and remedial work at certain sites that were the locations of former manufactured gas operations. (See Note 7A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) North Shore Gas received a demand from a responsible party under CERCLA for environmental costs associated with a site in Denver, Colorado. (See Note 7B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Gas Charge Reconciliation Proceedings and Related Matters. For each utility subsidiary, the Commission conducts annual proceedings regarding the reconciliation of revenues from the Gas Charge and related gas costs. In these proceedings, the accuracy of the reconciliation of revenues and costs is reviewed and the prudence of gas costs recovered through the Gas Charge is examined by interested parties. On March 21, 2005, the Illinois Attorney General (AG) and Chicago filed lawsuits against the Company and several of its subsidiaries alleging violations against its customers under certain state and city consumer fraud laws, respectively. On March 28, 2006, the Commission issued an order approving a settlement that resolved Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas fiscal 2001 2004 gas charge cases and the AG and Chicago lawsuits. (See Note 8A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) In February 2004, a purported class action was filed against the Company and Peoples Gas by a Peoples Gas customer alleging, among other things, violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act related to maters at issue in Peoples Gas gas charge reconciliation proceedings. (See Note 8B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 48 Indenture Restrictions North Shore Gas indenture relating to its first mortgage bonds contains provisions and covenants restricting the payment of cash dividends and the purchase or redemption of capital stock. At September 30, 2006, such restrictions amounted to $6.9 million of North Shore Gas total retained earnings of $76.3 million. Peoples Energy Resources owns a 50% equity interest in Elwood. Elwoods trust indenture and other agreements related to its project financing prohibit Elwood from making distributions unless Elwood has maintained certain minimum historic and projected debt service coverage ratios. At July 5, 2006, a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 was required to make a cash distribution and Elwoods actual debt service coverage ratio was approximately 1.4 to 1.0. PEOPLES GAS AND NORTH SHORE GAS DISCUSSIONS The financial results of Peoples Gas (including its hub operations) and North Shore Gas are reported primarily within the Gas Distribution segment. Operating income (GAAP) and ongoing operating income (non GAAP) by business segment for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas is presented below.

Fiscal 2005 ongoing operating income (non GAAP) is defined as GAAP operating income adjusted to exclude the effects of pension expense related restructuring costs of $8.8 million and $0.6 million at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, respectively. Fiscal 2004 ongoing operating income (non GAAP) is defined as GAAP operating income adjusted to exclude the effects of pension expense related restructuring costs of $9.7 million and $0.9 million at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, respectively. See Item 7 MD&A Executive Summary for a discussion of managements use of non GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP and non GAAP earnings. The following discussions supplement Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas information included in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in the Companys Gas Distribution segment discussion within this MD&A. Peoples Gas Discussion GAAP net loss for Peoples Gas for fiscal 2006 was $35.4 million compared to net income of $49.3 million in fiscal 2005. Excluding the charge related to the settlement of gas charge proceedings ($62.1 million, after tax), ongoing net income (non GAAP) was $26.6 million. Excluding pension related charges ($5.3 million, after tax) resulting from the fiscal year 2004 organizational restructuring, ongoing net income (non GAAP) for fiscal 2005 was $54.6 million. Revenues for fiscal 2006 increased $197.6 million compared with fiscal 2005. These results were due to the impact on revenues of changes in gas prices (an increase of $270 million) that are recovered on a dollar for dollar basis. These results also reflected the impact on revenues of decreased deliveries due to weather ($16 million) that was 2% warmer compared with the prior year, lower weather normalized demand ($88 million) and the impact of the change in the regulatory treatment of Hub revenues ($10.7 million) due to the gas charge settlement agreement. The $135.7 million decrease in operating income for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the $103.0 million charge related to the amended settlement of the gas charge proceedings, higher operation and maintenance 49 expense ($21.0 million), the change in treatment of Hub revenues ($10.7 million), lower deliveries resulting from warmer weather ($2 million) and lower normalized deliveries ($8 million). The increase in operation and maintenance expense was due to higher labor, pension, group insurance, bad debt, outside services and rate case expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the fiscal 2005 restructuring related pension charge of $8.8 million. Interest expense for Peoples Gas for fiscal 2006 increased $3.2 million due to higher interest rates and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate adjustments. Fiscal 2005 revenues for Peoples Gas increased $145.3 million from the previous period. The main reason for the increase was the impact on revenues of higher gas prices ($179 million). Partially offsetting these effects were lower revenues resulting from a decrease in deliveries due to weather ($27 million) that was 4% warmer than the previous period and a decrease in normalized deliveries. GAAP operating income increased $7.8 million from fiscal 2004. Operating income was favorably impacted by decreased labor costs related to the organizational restructuring ($8.6 million) and a decrease in depreciation expense ($5.7 million) primarily due to the Commission Depreciation Order. Negative impacts on 2005 results include lower deliveries resulting from warmer weather ($4.5 million). Fiscal 2005 interest expense for Peoples Gas increased $2.7 million over fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher interest rates. Total assets at September 30, 2006 increased $135.7 million compared to September 30, 2005 due primarily to an increase in current regulatory assets related to MTM accounting for the utility gas costs hedging program, an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets and capital investments related to the recognition of asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47, an increase in cash and cash equivalents, an increase in gas in storage (due to higher prices and volume), and an increase in prepaid pension costs (due to the elimination of the additional minimum pension liability as a result of increased plan funding and an increase in the discount rate). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in intercompany receivables due to of a decrease in derivative assets contracted by Peoples Energy on behalf of Peoples Gas that are marked to market. The decrease in derivative assets reflects price declines during fiscal 2006 relative to utility supply contracts (long positions). The increase in current liabilities was driven by an increase in intercompany payables (made up largely of unrealized losses on derivatives contracted by Peoples Energy on behalf of Peoples Gas that are marked to market) and increases in gas costs refundable through rate adjustments. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in current regulatory liabilities. The decrease in current regulatory liabilities largely corresponds with above decrease in derivative assets that are marked to market. Settlement of these assets is included as an adjustment to gas costs included in customer bills. Deferred credits and other liabilities increased primarily due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47, which largely correspond with the above increase in noncurrent regulatory assets. Peoples Gas capitalization increased with a $53.9 million equity contribution by the Company in Peoples Gas and a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss. These increases were partially offset by the reduction in retained earnings due primarily to dividend payments of $15.4 million and a $35.4 million fiscal 2006 net loss, which reflects the $62.1 million after tax charge related to the gas charge settlement. North Shore Gas Discussion GAAP net income for North Shore Gas for fiscal 2006 was $6.7 million compared to $11.4 million in fiscal 2005. Excluding the net charge related to the settlement of gas charge proceedings ($2.6 million, after tax), ongoing net income (loss) (non GAAP) was $9.3 million. Excluding pension related charges ($0.4 million, after tax) resulting from the fiscal year 2004 organizational restructuring, ongoing net income (non GAAP) for fiscal 2005 was $11.8 million. Revenues for North Shore Gas for fiscal 2006 increased $39.1 million compared to fiscal 2005, mainly due to the impact on revenues of higher gas prices ($48 million), partially offset by the impact of decreased deliveries due to weather ($4 million) that was 2% warmer compared with the same year ago period and lower weather normalized demand ($11 million). Operating income decreased $7.7 million for fiscal 2006. Results were unfavorably 50 impacted by the net charge ($4.3 million) related to the amended settlement of the gas charge proceedings, lower deliveries resulting from warmer weather ($0.5 million), lower normalized deliveries ($0.5 million), and higher operation and maintenance expenses ($3.7 million) which included $0.7 million of rate case costs, partially offset by the impact of the fiscal 2005 restructuring related pension charge of $0.6 million. Interest expense for North Shore Gas for fiscal 2006 increased $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate adjustments. Fiscal 2005 revenues for North Shore Gas increased $37.8 million over the prior period mainly due to the impact on revenues of higher gas prices ($42 million). Partially offsetting these effects were lower revenues resulting from a decrease in deliveries due to weather ($4 million) that was 4% warmer compared to the prior period. GAAP operating income for fiscal 2005 was flat compared to fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 results were favorably impacted by a decrease in depreciation expense ($1.4 million) primarily due to the Commission Depreciation Order and negatively impacted by an increase in pension expense ($1.0 million). Total assets at September 30, 2006 increased $28.8 million compared to September 30, 2005 due to an increase in current regulatory assets related primarily to MTM accounting for the utility gas costs hedging program, an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets related to the recognition of asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47, and an increase in gas in storage. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in intercompany receivables made up largely of a decrease in derivative assets contracted by Peoples Energy on behalf of North Shore Gas that are marked to market. The decrease in derivative assets reflects price declines during fiscal 2006 relative to utility supply contracts (long positions). The increase in current liabilities was driven by an increase in intercompany payables (made up largely of unrealized losses on derivatives contracted by Peoples Energy on behalf of North Shore Gas that are marked to market) and an increase in gas costs refundable through rate adjustments. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in regulatory liabilities. The decrease in regulatory liabilities largely corresponds with the above decrease in derivative assets that are marked to market. Settlement of these assets is included as an adjustment to gas costs included in customer bills. The Companys capitalization decreased with the reduction in retained earnings due primarily to dividend payments of $11.0 million, partially offset by $6.7 million of net income, which was negatively affected by the $2.6 million after tax charge related to the gas charge settlement. 51 The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company Gas Distribution Statistics For Fiscal Years Ended Increase/(Decrease) Margin Data September 30, Fiscal 2006 vs. Fiscal 2005 vs. (In Thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Gas Distribution revenues: Sales Residential $ 1,249,993 $ 1,086,435 $ 974,143 $ 163,558 $ 112,292 Commercial 203,005 175,904 155,934 27,101 19,970 Industrial 32,936 28,720 24,112 4,216 4,608 Total sales 1,485,934 1,291,059 1,154,189 194,875 136,870 Transportation Residential 33,260 30,699 30,645 2,561 54 Commercial 43,734 42,329 41,131 1,405 1,198 Industrial 15,995 16,994 16,656 (999 ) 338 Contract pooling 26,643 18,381 14,017 8,262 4,364 Total transportation 119,632 108,403 102,449 11,229 5,954 Total Hub revenues 10,662 7,620 (10,662 ) 3,042 Other Gas Distribution revenues 16,725 14,579 15,117 2,146 (538 ) Total Gas Distribution revenues 1,622,291 1,424,703 1,279,375 197,588 145,328 Less: Gas costs 1,052,333 853,453 723,771 198,880 129,682 Gross margin 569,958 571,250 555,604 (1,292 ) 15,646 Less: Revenue taxes and surcharges 149,786 136,115 125,500 13,671 10,615 Environmental costs recovered 31,588 28,574 16,206 3,014 12,368 Net margin (1) $ 388,584 $ 406,561 $ 413,898 $ (17,977 ) $ (7,337 ) Gas Distribution deliveries (MDth): Gas sales Residential 85,381 91,217 97,035 (5,836 ) (5,818 ) Commercial 15,021 16,022 16,856 (1,001 ) (834 ) Industrial 2,571 2,801 2,790 (230 ) 11 Total gas sales 102,973 110,040 116,681 (7,067 ) (6,641 ) Transportation Residential 18,637 19,134 20,210 (497 ) (1,076 ) Commercial 35,645 35,024 37,287 621 (2,263 ) Industrial 16,101 17,662 18,139 (1,561 ) (477 ) Total transportation 70,383 71,820 75,636 (1,437 ) (3,816 ) Total Gas Distribution deliveries 173,356 181,860 192,317 (8,504 ) (10,457 ) Total Hub volumes 22,784 19,381 (22,784 ) 3,403 Gross margin per Dth delivered (3) $ 3.29 $ 3.08 $ 2.85 $ 0.21 $ 0.23 Net margin per Dth delivered (3) $ 2.24 $ 2.18 $ 2.11 $ 0.06 $ 0.07 Average cost per Dth of gas sold $ 10.22 $ 7.76 $ 6.20 $ 2.46 $ 1.56 Actual heating degree days 5,775 5,864 6,091 (89 ) (227 ) Normal heating degree days (2) 6,408 6,427 6,427 Actual heating degree days as a percent of normal (actual/normal) 90 91 95 (1) As used above, net margin is not a financial measure computed under GAAP but represents an operating performance measure. Gross margin is the GAAP measure most closely related to net margin. Management believes net margin to be useful in understanding Peoples Gas operations because the utility subsidiaries are allowed, under their tariffs, to recover gas costs, revenue taxes and environmental costs from their customers on a dollar for dollar basis. (2) Normal heating degree days for fiscal 2004 and 2005 are based on a 30 year average of monthly temperatures at Chicagos OHare Airport for the years 1970 1999.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices, weather, interest rates, and credit. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by the Company as an integral part of its overall risk management program. The Companys risk management program includes, among other things, the use of financial derivatives. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are reported under Item 1ARisk Factors and below under Risk Management Activities. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Commodity Price Risk The Companys earnings may vary due to changes in commodity prices (market risk) that affect its subsidiaries operations and investments. To manage this market risk, the Company uses forward contracts and financial instruments, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. It is the policy of the Company to use these instruments solely for the purpose of managing risk and not for any speculative purpose. Derivative Summary. The following table summarizes the changes in valuation of all outstanding derivative contracts during fiscal 2006 and 2005. All amounts are based on fair values at the end of the period and do not necessarily indicate that a gain or loss on the derivative will be recognized in income in future periods. Generally, hedges are held to maturity, which coincides with recognition of the transaction being hedged (e.g., anticipated sales or cost of purchases in income), thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies.

The increase in the value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges was driven primarily by the effect of lower forward prices and a reduction of hedged volumes in the Oil and Gas Production segments derivatives portfolio. The increase in the value of contracts designated as fair value hedges was driven primarily by an increase in value in the Energy Marketing segments storage optimization portfolio, partially offset by the decrease in value of the Companys floating rate interest rate swap reflecting the rise in short term interest rates. The primary cause of the decrease in the value of contracts designated as MTM is attributable to the impact of the change in the forward price curve on the derivative instruments of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas used to manage each utilitys cost of gas supply. This was partially offset by the positive impact of changes in prices on MTM portfolios at the Energy Marketing segment. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, unrealized losses on contracts attributed to Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were $322 million and $61 million, respectively. SFAS No. 71 allows for these MTM derivative gains and losses to be recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Realized gains and losses 54 are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of gas supply in the period that the underlying gas purchase transaction takes place. The costs and benefits of this activity are passed through to customers under the tariffs of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The following table is a summary of the fair market value of commodity derivatives by type at September 30, 2006. Valuations are based on the NYMEX closing prices for the respective NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts and on the closing prices published in various commodity pricing publications for the geographical differential between a specific location price and the NYMEX Henry Hub futures contract closing price where applicable. 55 Commodity Derivatives (Fair Value amounts in thousands) Futures/Forwards Maturity Volumes (MMbtus) Price Per MMbtu Fair Value Long Natural Gas Less than 1 Year 13,538,565 3.53 11.98 $ (13,787) Short Natural Gas Less than 1 Year 11,443,642 3.50 12.34 18,922 Long Natural Gas 1 3 Years 2,599,737 7.27 11.00 (127) Short Natural Gas 1 3 Years 860,000 8.63 9.99 (111) 28,441,944 $ 4,897 Options Maturity Volumes (MMbtus) Price Per MMbtu Fair Value Long Natural Gas Less than 1 Year 9,394,500 5.00 15.00 $ 4,702 Short Natural Gas Less than 1 Year 10,434,500 5.50 15.00 (17,440) Long Natural Gas 1 3 Years 2,852,000 7.00 9.00 3,465 Short Natural Gas 1 3 Years 2,852,000 5.50 12.00 (2,011) 25,533,000 $ (11,284) Swaps (NG) Maturity Volumes (MMbtus) Price Per MMbtu Fair Value Long Natural Gas Less than 1 Year 77,515,502 2.83 13.04 $ (151,621) Short Natural Gas Less than 1 Year 27,007,500 0.96 12.54 4,844 Long Natural Gas 1 3 Years 15,896,721 6.57 10.82 (11,908) Short Natural Gas 1 3 Years 10,955,000 3.84 11.83 3,373 Long Natural Gas 4 5 Years 1,920,000 6.60 7.10 91 Short Natural Gas 4 5 Years 1,920,000 8.99 9.50 1,498 Long Natural Gas More than 5 Years 900,000 6.86 49 Short Natural Gas More than 5 Years 2,820,000 8.31 9.15 1,180 138,934,723 $ (152,494) Total (NG) Maturity Volumes (MMbtus) Price Per MMbtu Fair Value Long Natural Gas Less than 1 Year 100,448,567 2.83 15.00 $ (160,706) Short Natural Gas Less than 1 Year 48,885,642 0.96 15.00 6,326 Long Natural Gas 1 3 Years 21,348,458 6.57 11.00 (8,570) Short Natural Gas 1 3 Years 14,667,000 3.84 12.00 1,251 Long Natural Gas 4 5 Years 1,920,000 6.60 7.10 91 Short Natural Gas 4 5 Years 1,920,000 8.99 9.50 1,498 Long Natural Gas More than 5 Years 900,000 6.86 49 Short Natural Gas More than 5 Years 2,820,000 8.31 9.15 1,180 192,909,667 $ (158,881) Swaps (OIL) Maturity Volumes (Bbls) Price Per Bbl Fair Value Short WTI Crude Oil Less than 1 Year 182,500 37.50 $ (5,227) Short WTI Crude Oil 1 3 Years 73,200 56.60 (837) 255,700 $ (6,064) Futures/Forwards (Megawatt hours) Maturity Amounts (Mwhs) Price Per Mwh Fair Value Long Megawatt hours Less than 1 Year 633,938 (0.20) 0.36 $ 52 633,938 $ 52 Grand Total Fair Value of Commodity Derivatives $ (164,893) Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap (1,548) Grand Total Fair Value of all Derivatives $ (166,441) 56 Cash Flow Hedges. The Company has positions in oil and gas reserves, natural gas, and transportation as part of its Oil and Gas Production and Energy Marketing businesses, and related to its company use gas in the Gas Distribution segment. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to protect against loss of value of future anticipated cash transactions (sales and purchases) caused by changes in the marketplace. These instruments are designated cash flow hedges, which allow for the effective portion of unrealized changes in value during the life of the hedge to be recorded in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses from cash flow hedges are recorded in the statement of operations in the same month the related physical sales and purchases and interest expense are recorded. Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions will occur. The carrying value of contracts which no longer qualify for hedge accounting are prospectively marked to market, with the change in value recorded in the statement of operations. If the original forecasted transactions are probable of not occurring, any amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income are immediately recorded in the statement of operations. Hedge ineffectiveness can result from differences in critical terms (such as location) between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction and result in the immediate recognition of gains or losses. Fair Value Hedges. The Company uses financial and physical hedges to protect the value of a portion of Energy Marketings gas in storage and these are accounted for as fair value hedges. The change in value of these hedges and the change in value of the inventory hedged are expected to largely offset in each reporting period in the statement of operations. During the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Energy Marketing segment recorded MTM losses of $3.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, related to the application of fair value hedge accounting to certain storage inventory transactions. The Energy Marketing segment uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the profit margin that it will ultimately realize when inventory volumes are withdrawn from storage. Under fair value accounting, which is used for certain storage activity, the MTM adjustment to inventory is computed using spot prices, while the derivatives used to mitigate the risk of changes in inventory value are marked to market using forward prices. When the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price, the difference is recorded in operating results. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility, even when the underlying expected profit margin over the duration of the contracts is unchanged. The volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period. A portion of this accounting loss will reverse next year if the volumes are withdrawn from storage. At September 30, 2006, gas inventory hedged using fair value accounting at Energy Marketing had a fair value of $18.0 million, including MTM decreases in inventory totaling $16.8 million for changes in spot prices. Derivative assets totaling $10.3 million were recorded for the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge this inventory. At September 30, 2005, hedged gas inventory at Energy Marketing had a fair value of $44.1 million, including MTM increases in inventory totaling $17.6 million for changes in spot prices. Derivative liabilities totaling $20.9 million were recorded for the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge this inventory. The Company also uses certain financial instruments to adjust the portfolio composition of its debt from fixed rate to floating rate debt. These derivative instruments are accounted for as fair value hedges and are not material to the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The change in value of these hedges along with the offsetting change in value of the debt hedged (to the extent the hedge is effective) are recorded in each reporting period in interest expense in the statement of operations. Mark To Market Derivative Instruments. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas use derivative instruments to manage each utilitys cost of gas supply and mitigate price volatility. All such derivative instruments are measured at fair value. The regulated utilities tariffs allow for full recovery from their customers of prudently incurred gas supply costs, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. As a result, SFAS No. 71 allows these MTM derivative gains or losses to be recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Realized gains or losses are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of gas supply in the period that the underlying gas purchase transaction takes place. The costs and benefits of this activity are passed through to customers under the tariffs of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The Energy Marketing segment uses certain derivative contracts (such as NYMEX or Basis swaps) that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Included in these contracts are hedges of location differentials associated with its wholesale natural gas contracts and transactions involving storage assets. In the fiscal year 57 ended September 30, 2006, the Energy Marketing segment recognized MTM pretax gains (losses) (included in revenues) of $1.3 million related to these derivatives. As physical volumes are delivered under natural gas contracts or withdrawn under certain gas storage contracts, these MTM accounting impacts are reversed. The above amounts include net MTM activity both for hedges for settlement in future periods and the reversal of amounts recorded in prior periods and settled within the current period. The following table summarizes the market value of these outstanding instruments and other derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and are recorded on a MTM basis. All amounts are expected to be settled during the next 12 months. September 30, (In Thousands) 2006 2005 Peoples Gas mark to market asset (liability) $ (128,417 ) $ 172,549 North Shore Gas mark to market asset (liability) (24,135 ) 33,754 Other mark to market asset (liability) 992 (2,027 ) Total $ (151,560 ) $ 204,276 Weather Risk The Companys Gas Distribution earnings vary due to the warmth or severity of the weather. The Company has managed this risk through the purchase of weather insurance and the use of block rates in utility rate design. Block rates help mitigate the effect of warm weather by allowing greater cost recovery on the first volumes through the meter and less on the last volumes. The insurance in place for fiscal 2005 was provided by a subsidiary of X.L. America, Inc. and protected the Company for a portion of lost revenue incurred when weather was more than 5% warmer than normal. In fiscal 2005 the Company recognized as additional revenues $3.5 million in insurance recoveries. No weather insurance was purchased for fiscal 2006 as the Company views the current market pricing for this product as excessive relative to the risk it would protect against. The Energy Marketing business segment can also be affected by weather variations. Storage, swing supply and weather derivatives are used or are available to protect earnings and ensure performance. Interest Rate Risk The Company uses interest rate derivatives to adjust the portfolio composition of fixed rate and floating rate debt and it accounts for these derivatives as fair value hedges. In August 2004, the Company entered into a six month LIBOR based interest rate swap agreement on $50.0 million of its $325.0 million 6.90% Series A Notes, due January 15, 2011. Under this agreement, the Company will receive the fixed price of 6.90% and pay six month LIBOR plus a defined spread on the notional amount of $50.0 million. The payments will reset on the 15th day of each January and July until maturity of the Series A Notes. Credit Risk The Company has established a credit policy to mitigate the effect of nonperformance on wholesale transactions. Pursuant to this policy, a credit limit is established for all counterparties based on a review of their financial condition. The Company reviews, and changes when necessary, its credit underwriting and monitoring procedures. The Company has adequate financial assurance provisions in its commercial agreements that permit the Company to call for credit support when warranted. Action may include the calling of collateral, adjusting credit lines, changing payment terms or reducing future business. In addition, netting arrangements and requirements to post margin are used to further reduce credit exposure. Credit risk for the utility companies is spread over a diversified base of residential, commercial and industrial customers. Customers payment records are continually monitored and credit deposits are required, when appropriate. 58
