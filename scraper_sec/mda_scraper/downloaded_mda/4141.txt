ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General Unico American Corporation is an insurance holding company that underwrites property and casualty insurance through its insurance company subsidiary; provides property, casualty, health and life insurance through its agency subsidiaries, insurance premium financing, and membership association services. The Companys net income was $11,794,241 in 2006, $6,715,004 in 2005, and $5,681,500 in 2004. This overview discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the Companys performance, prospects and risks. It is not all inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of the management discussion and analysis, the Companys financial statements and notes thereto, and all other items contained within the report on this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revenue and Income Generation The Company receives its revenue primarily from earned premium derived from the insurance company operations, commission and fee income generated from the insurance agency operations, finance charges and 16 fee income from the premium finance operations, and investment income from cash generated primarily from the insurance company operation. The insurance company operation generates approximately 89% of the Companys total revenue. The Companys remaining operations constitute a variety of specialty insurance services, each with unique characteristics and individually not material to consolidated revenues. Insurance Company Operation The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and includes many insurers, ranging from large companies offering a wide variety of products worldwide to smaller, specialized companies in a single state or region offering only a single product. Many of the Companys existing or potential competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources, have a higher rating assigned by independent rating organizations such as A.M. Best Company, have greater experience in the insurance industry and offer a broader line of insurance products than the Company. Crusader is writing primarily Commercial Multiple Peril business only in the state of California. Crusaders financial strength rating has been upgraded by A.M. Best Company from B+ (Good) to B++ (Good), effective January 2, 2007, with a rating outlook of stable. A primary challenge of the property and casualty insurance company operation is contending with the fact that the Company sells its products before the ultimate costs are actually known. That is, when pricing its products, the Company must forecast the ultimate claim and loss adjustment costs. In addition, factors such as changes in regulations and legal environment, among other things, can all impact the accuracy of such cost forecasts. The property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by periods of soft market conditions, in which premium rates are stable or falling and insurance is readily available, and by periods of hard market conditions, in which premium rates rise, coverage may be more difficult to find and insurers profits increase. The Company believes that the California property and casualty insurance market has transitioned to a "soft market" in the last few years The Company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue, nor in which direction they might change. Despite the increased competition in the property and casualty marketplace, the Company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth, and that underwriting profit (net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs) is its primary goal. For the year ended December 31, 2006, gross written premium was $51,913,967, a decrease of $8,354,817 (14%) compared to 2005. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events of the current year were $29,997,662, offset by $12,170,683 of favorable development for events of prior years. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events of the current year were $35,338,196, offset by $3,824,464 of favorable development for events of prior years. The favorable developments resulted from settling or re estimating claims for lesser amounts than they were previously forecast. Other Operations The Companys other operations generate commissions, fees, and finance charges from various insurance products. The events that have the most significant economic impact are as follows: Unifax primarily sells and services insurance policies for Crusader. The commissions paid by Crusader to Unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the financial statements. Policy fee income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, decreased 12% as compared to the prior year. The decrease in policy fee income is a result of a decrease in the number of policies issued during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, offset in part by an approximate 8% increase in the policy fee for policies effective on or after June 26, 2005. AAQHC provides various consumer benefits to its members, including participation in group health care and life insurance policies. For these services, AAQHC receives membership and fee income from its members. Membership and fee income decreased 6% in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. The decrease is a result of the decrease in the number of members. In May 2006, CIGNA HealthCare began offering new small group medical insurance policies in the state of California. Currently, all new CIGNA small group medical insurance policies are written through AIB and all CIGNA small group medical insurance policyholders are members of AAQHC. The new programs are competitively priced and are being actively marketed. 17 AIB sells and services health insurance policies for individual/family and small business groups and receives commissions based on the premiums that it writes. Commissions remained relatively comparable in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. AAC provides premium financing for Crusader policies that are produced by Unifax in California. Finance charges and fees earned by AAC during 2006 decreased 10% as compared to 2005. The decrease is primarily a result of a 17% decrease in the number of loans issued in 2006 compared to 2005. Average premium financed increased 8% to $2,758 in 2006 from $2,557 in 2005. The daily automobile rental insurance program is produced by Bedford Insurance Services, Inc. Bedford receives a commission from a non affiliated insurance company based on premium written. Commission in the daily automobile rental insurance program decreased $135,714 (27%) as compared to 2005. The decrease is due to the continued intense competition in the daily automobile rental insurance program. Bedford continues to produce business only at rates that it believes are adequate. Primarily due to declining sales, in April 2006 Bedford hired a new general manager who has substantial experience in the daily automobile rental insurance business. Future sales growth of the Bedford program is also currently dependent upon the non affiliated insurance company approving and implementing various product enhancements that Bedford recommends. Bedford is currently working with the non affiliated insurance company to obtain their approval of the recommended program enhancements. Investments and Liquidity The Company generates revenue from its investment portfolio, which consisted of approximately $147.3 million (at amortized cost) at December 31, 2006, compared to $140.6 million (at amortized cost) at December 31, 2005. Investment income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, increased $1.7 million or 39% in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to both an increase in invested assets of approximately $6.7 million (5%) and an increase in the Companys annualized yield on average invested assets from 3.2% in 2005 to 4.2% in 2006. The increase in the annualized yield on average invested assets is a result of higher yields in the marketplace on both new and reinvested assets. Due to the current interest rate environment, management believes it is prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with maturities of five years or less and with minimal credit risk. As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average maturity of the Companys fixed maturity investments was 1.3 years compared to 1.2 years and 1.4 years as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Due to the nature of the Companys business (insurance and insurance services) and whereas Company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment, the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the Company. Because the Company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries, its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the Company. The cash flow provided by operations in the year ended December 31, 2006, was $6,297,894, a decrease in cash flow of $3,500,448 compared to the cash flow for the year ending December 31, 2005. Cash flow provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $9,798,342, a decrease of $5,025,495 in cash provided compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities and from the maturity of its fixed maturity investments primarily to purchase $68.9 million of fixed maturity securities in 2006. The most significant liquidity risk faced by the Company is adverse development of the insurance companys loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Based on the Companys current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments, the Company believes that there are no current liquidity issues. However, no assurance can be given that the Companys estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense reserves will be sufficient. Crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves, its reserves for loss payments, and its capital and surplus. Crusaders loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the Company. These payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the Company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its 18 investments. Cash and investments (excluding net unrealized gains or losses) at December 31, 2006, were $147,346,870 compared to $140,617,062 at December 31, 2005, a 5% increase. Crusaders cash and investments at December 31, 2006, was $144,120,695 or 98% of the total held by the Company, compared to $137,990,174 or 98% of the total held by the Company at December 31, 2005. The Companys investments are as follows: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Amount % Amount % Amount % Fixed maturities (at amortized cost) Certificates of deposit $400,000 $500,000 $500,000 U.S. treasury securities 127,553,801 91 107,290,653 79 77,765,616 60 U.S. government sponsored enterprise securities 6,000,000 4 11,998,772 10 Industrial and miscellaneous (taxable) 12,523,393 9 21,403,239 16 37,754,927 29 State and municipal (tax exempt) 15,134 934,536 1 970,343 1 Total fixed maturity investments 140,492,328 100 136,128,428 100 128,989,658 100 Short term cash investments (at cost) Certificates of deposit 200,000 3 100,000 2 400,000 13 Cash deposit in lieu of bond* 200,000 5 752,659 24 Commercial paper 1,665,000 25 1,830,000 41 1,005,000 32 Bank money market accounts 210,270 3 182,673 4 803,949 26 U.S. govt obligation money market fund 411,206 6 2,150,671 48 144,925 5 Short term U.S. treasury bills 4,322,048 63 Bank savings accounts 11,483 11,818 11,585 Total short term cash investments 6,820,007 100 4,475,162 100 3,118,118 100 Total investments $147,312,335 $140,603,590 $132,107,776 * Deposits with superior courts to stay execution of judgment pending appeal of Crusader claims. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," the Company is required to classify its investment securities into one of three categories: held to maturity, available for sale, or trading securities. Although all of the Companys investment in fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and the Company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions, its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity. The Companys investment guidelines on equity securities limit investments in equity securities to an aggregate maximum of $2,000,000. The Companys investment guidelines on fixed maturities limit those investments to high grade obligations with a maximum term of eight years. The maximum investment authorized in any one issuer is $2,000,000 and the maximum in any one U.S. government agency or U.S. government sponsored enterprise is $3,000,000. This dollar limitation excludes bond premiums paid in excess of par value and U.S. government or U.S. government guaranteed issues. Investments in municipal securities are primarily pre refunded and secured by U.S. treasury securities. The short term investments are either U.S. government obligations, FDIC insured, or are in an institution with a Moodys rating of P2 and or a Standard & Poors rating of A1. All of the Companys fixed maturity securities are rated and readily marketable and could be liquidated without any materially adverse financial impact. During 2005 the Company began its conversion to a "paperless office" including improvements to its computer network, hardware, and other related computer infrastructure. These projects were substantially completed in 2006. The Company is now fine tuning its paperless office systems and back scanning its previous paper files and documents. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had incurred approximately $760,000 of capital expenditures on the paperless office and the related computer infrastructure projects. During 2006, the Company began benefiting from these capital expenditures due to productivity improvements, improved customer service, and lower operating costs. In addition, the Company is in the process of enhancing its technology related to its underwriting procedures and electronic communication systems to better accommodate its customers needs and to improve operating efficiencies. 19 Crusaders statutory capital and surplus as of December 31, 2006, was $50,023,768, an increase of $13,437,327 (37%) from December 31, 2005. Crusaders statutory capital and surplus as of December 31, 2005, was $36,586,441, an increase of $7,150,098 (24%) from December 31, 2004. No dividends were declared or paid by Crusader to Unico in 2006, 2005 or 2004. Based on Crusaders statutory net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, the maximum dividend that could be made by Crusader to Unico without prior regulatory approval in 2007 is $13,396,732. The Company has previously announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase in the open market from time to time of up to an aggregate of 945,000 shares of the common stock of the Company (see Note 16 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"). During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company did not repurchase any shares of the Companys common stock. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has purchased and retired under the Board of Directors authorization an aggregate of 868,958 shares of its common stock at a cost of $5,517,465. Although material capital expenditures may also be funded through borrowings, the Company believes that its cash and short term investments at year end, net of trust restriction of $933,053, statutory deposits of $700,000, and California insurance company statutory dividend restrictions applicable to Crusader plus the cash to be generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements during the next twelve months without the necessity of borrowing funds. As a California insurance company, Crusader is obligated to pay a premium tax on gross premiums written in all states that Crusader is admitted. Premium taxes are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned. The premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes and is not included in the provision for state taxes. The Company has certain obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments. At December 31, 2006, certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows: Within 1 3 3 5 After Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 years Building lease $5,591,438 $1,056,731 $2,133,980 $2,133,980 $266,747 Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves* 93,596,117 35,007,595 36,371,998 12,755,566 9,460,958 Total $99,187,555 $36,064,326 $38,505,978 $14,889,546 $9,727,705 * Unlike many other forms of contractual obligations, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties. As a result, the total loss and loss adjustment expense reserve payments to be made by period, as shown above, are estimates. Results of Operations General The Company had net income of $11,794,241 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to net income of $6,715,004 for the year ended December 31, 2005, and net income of $5,681,500 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $54,717,381 compared to $61,182,522 for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $61,903,310 for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had income before taxes of $18,153,986 compared to income before taxes of $10,466,430 in the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase in income before taxes of $7,687,556. The increase in pre tax income was primarily due to an increase of $7,404,321 in the underwriting profit from Crusader. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company had income before taxes of $10,466,430 compared to income before taxes of $8,672,458 in the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase in income before taxes of $1,793,972. The increase in pre tax income was primarily due to an increase of $3,114,856 in the underwriting 20 profit (net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs) from Crusader offset by $995,849 decrease in gross commissions and fees income. The effect of inflation on the net income of the Company during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was not significant. The Company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below. Insurance Company Operation Premium and loss information of Crusader are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Gross written premium $51,913,967 $60,268,784 $68,872,021 Net written premium (net of reinsurance ceded) $38,166,864 $46,030,707 $51,089,573 Earned premium before reinsurance ceded $56,692,213 $64,712,764 $67,890,808 Earned premium (net of reinsurance ceded) $42,933,789 $50,477,920 $50,106,568 Losses and loss adjustment expenses $17,826,979 $31,513,732 $34,450,738 Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $93,596,117 $101,914,548 $87,469,000 Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $70,076,430 $76,235,467 $67,349,989 Crusaders primary line of business is commercial multiple peril policies. This line of business represented approximately 97% of Crusaders total written premium for the year ended December 31, 2006, 97% for the year ended December 31, 2005, and 98% for the year ended December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2006, Crusader was licensed as an admitted insurance company in the states of Arizona, California, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington and is approved as a non admitted surplus lines writer in other states. Premiums For the year ended December 31, 2006, gross written premium decreased by $8,354,817 (14%) over 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gross written premium decreased by $8,603,237 (12%) over 2004. The decrease in written premium in both 2006 and 2005 reflected heightened competition and managements continued emphasis on rate adequacy and underwriting discipline. The Company cannot determine how long the existing market condition will continue, nor in which direction it might change. The Companys future writings and growth are dependent on market conditions, competition, and upon the Companys ability to introduce new marketing channels and profitable products. The Company continues to believe that it can compete effectively and profitably by offering better service and by focusing its marketing efforts upon independent agents. Historically, most of Crusaders marketing was aimed at independent insurance brokers, representatives of the consumer. With the relatively recent advent of heightened competition and of declining sales, in 2007 Crusader adopted a plan to supplement its marketing efforts with independent agents, representatives of the Company. The Company believes that those agents will be particularly effective and that their efforts will not diminish the business historically produced by independent brokers. Crusader expects to begin making those agency appointments during 2007. The Company writes annual policies and, therefore, earns written premium daily over the one year policy term. Premium earned before reinsurance decreased $8,020.551 (12%) in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, and decreased $3,178,044 (5%) in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in earned premium before reinsurance in 2006 and 2005 is a direct result of the decrease in written premium in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Earned ceded premium for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006, decreased $476,420 (3%) to $13,758,424 compared to $14,234,844 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2005. Earned ceded premiums as a percentage of direct earned premiums were 24% and 22% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Earned ceded premium for the 12 months ended December 31, 2005, decreased $3,594,396 (20%) to $14,234,844 compared to $17,784,240 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004. Earned ceded premiums as a percentage of direct earned premiums were 22% and 26% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. 21 In 2006 and 2005 Crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 10% in its 1st layer ($700,000 in excess of $300,000), 10% in its 2nd layer ($1,000,000 in excess of $1,000,000), and 30% in its property and casualty clash treaties. In 2004 Crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 10% in its 1st layer ($750,000 in excess of $250,000), 10% in its 2nd layer ($1,000,000 in excess of $1,000,000), and 30% in its property and casualty clash treaties. In 2003 Crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 5% in its 1st layer ($750,000 in excess of $250,000), 10% in its 2nd layer ($1,000,000 in excess of $1,000,000), and 30% in its property and casualty clash treaties. Crusaders 2006 1st layer primary excess of loss treaty provides for a contingent commission equal to 20% of the net profit, if any, accruing to the reinsurer. The first accounting period for the contingent commission covers the period from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2006. The 2005 1st layer primary excess of loss treaties do not provide for a contingent commission. Crusaders 2004 and 2003 1st layer primary excess of loss treaty provides for a contingent commission to the Company equal to 45% of the net profit, if any, accruing to the reinsurer. The first accounting period for the contingent commission covers the period from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2004. The Company will calculate and report to the reinsurer its net profit, if any, within 90 days after 36 months following the end of the first accounting period, and within 90 days after the end of each 12 month period thereafter until all losses subject to the agreement have been finally settled. Based on losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded (including incurred but not reported losses) as of December 31, 2006, no contingent commission has been accrued for each of the periods discussed above. Crusaders direct earned premium, earned ceded premium, and ceding com`mission are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Direct earned premium $56,692,213 $64,712,764 $67,890,808 Earned ceded premium Excluding provisionally rated ceded premium 13,825,061 14,281,810 17,843,805 Provisionally rated ceded premium (66,637) (46,966) (59,565) Total earned ceded premium 13,758,424 14,234,844 17,784,240 Ceding commission 4,376,474 4,647,748 6,031,987 Earned ceded premium, net of ceding commission $9,381,950 $9,587,096 $11,752,253 Ratios to direct earned premium Direct ceded premium 24% 22% 26% Earned ceded premium, net of ceding commission 17% 15% 17% Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Losses and loss adjustment expenses and loss ratio are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Net earned premium $42,933,789 $50,477,920 $50,106,568 Net losses and loss adjustment expenses Provision for insured events of current year 29,997,662 35,338,196 35,286,172 (Decrease) in provision for events of prior years (12,170,683) (3,824,464) (835,434) Total net losses and loss adjustment expenses $17,826,979 $31,513,732 $34,450,738 Loss ratio 41.5% 62.4% 68.8% Expected losses and loss adjustment expenses are determined based on earned premiums. The portion of the premium dollar expected to pay claims costs is referred to as the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Accident years 2004 through 2006 has substantially the same expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The Companys emerging loss and loss adjustment expense ratios for each accident year are reviewed in detail at the end of each quarter as part of the reserve diagnostics testing. The combined ratio is the sum of (1) the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred (including a provision for incurred but not reported losses "IBNR") to net premiums earned (loss ratio) and (2) the ratio of 22 policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned (expense ratio). The following table shows the loss ratios, expense ratios, and combined ratios of Crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Loss ratio 41.5% 62.4% 68.8% Expense ratio 21.5% 20.8% 20.6% Combined ratio 63.0% 83.2% 89.4% As indicated in the above table, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2006, decreased to 41.5% from 62.4% in 2005 and 68.8% in 2004. The continuous decrease in the loss ratio was primarily due to improvements in the provision for prior years incurred losses. Generally, if the combined ratio is below 100%, an insurance company has an underwriting profit; if it is above 100%, a company has an underwriting loss. The Companys net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the calendar year ended December 31, 2006, were $17,826,979. This amount is comprised of accident year 2006 net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $29,997,662 and favorable development of prior accident years of $12,170,683. The Companys net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the calendar year ended December 31, 2005, were $31,513,732. This amount is comprised of accident year 2005 net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $35,338,196 and favorable development of prior accident years of $3,824,464. The Companys net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the calendar year ended December 31, 2004, were $34,450,738. This amount is comprised of accident year 2004 net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $35,286,172 and favorable development of prior accident years of $835,434. The favorable development by accident year is as follows: Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Favorable Favorable % of Favorable % of (Adverse) % of Accident Year Development Total Development Total Development Total Prior to 2001 $701,989 6% $474,872 12% $(197,143) (24%) 2001 754,141 6% 754,085 20% (147,614) (18%) 2002 819,572 7% 578,264 15% (544,484) (65%) 2003 1,744,350 14% 1,618,207 42% 1,724,675 207% 2004 7,524,447 62% 399,036 11% 2005 626,184 5% Total prior accident years $12,170,683 100% $3,824,464 100% $835,434 100% As reflected in the above table, the increase in the favorable development for the year ended December 31, 2006 is primarily due to a substantial decrease in the provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses for accident year 2004 during the calendar year 2006. This favorable development arose from the lower than expected emergence of losses during 2006 relative to expectations used to establish our loss reserves at the end of 2005 and 2004. The severity of late reported property and casualty claims that emerged during 2006 was lower than expected and case development on previously reported claims was better than expected. During the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company determined that the favorable development of accident year 2004, which developed during 2006, was sufficient to warrant a reduction in the ultimate expected losses and loss adjustment expenses for that accident year. During the first three quarters of 2006, the Company determined that the development during that period was not sufficient to warrant reducing accident year 2004 reserves further than previously recorded. Because the incidence of the CMP losses is subject to a considerable element of fortuity, reserve estimates for this line are based on an analysis of past loss experience on average over a period of years. As a result, the favorable development recognized in 2006 had a minimal effect on our determination of carried CMP loss reserves at December 31, 2006. The adjustment of prior accident year reserves discussed above is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Any reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses from redundancies in the Companys December 31, 2006, reserves over actual future payments, and or any additional losses and loss adjustment expenses from actual 23 future payments that exceed the Companys reserves, will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations of future accounting periods. The Companys current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption closely approximates the Companys historical average loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. A difference between the Companys current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption and the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for a given accident year will ultimately result in a dollar change (either higher or lower) that is a multiple of the earned premium for that year. The actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within five percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in four of the Companys twenty two years. Since the Companys net earned premium in 2006 was $42,933,789, a difference between the accident year 2006 actual and current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios of only five percentage points will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by $2,146,689. The actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within ten percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in nine of the Companys twenty two years. A difference of ten percentage points on accident year 2006 will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by $4,293,379. The actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within twenty percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in fifteen of the Companys twenty two years. A twenty percentage point difference between the accident year 2006 actual and the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by $8,586,758. In addition, accident years 2005 and prior are still developing. Future development on those years might either offset or add to any future development that emerges on accident year 2006. Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses The Companys liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense (reserves) consists of case reserves and reserves for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. Case reserves are established by claims personnel based on a review of the facts known at the time the claim is reported and are subsequently revised as more information about a claim becomes known. IBNR is computed using various actuarial methods and techniques and includes (1) reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported to the Company, and (2) a provision for expected future development on case reserves for information not currently known. The Companys loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Direct reserves Case reserves $21,796,117 $23,114,548 $19,699,000 IBNR reserves 71,800,000 78,800,000 67,770,000 Total direct reserves $93,596,117 $101,914,548 $87,469,000 Reserves net of reinsurance Case reserves $18,776,430 $19,135,467 $17,879,989 IBNR reserves 51,300,000 57,100,000 49,470,000 Total net reserves $70,076,430 $76,235,467 $67,349,989 Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance for each of Crusaders lines of business were as follows: Year ended December 31 Line of Business 2006 2005 2004 CMP $90,604,178 96.8% $98,758,298 96.9% $83,677,560 95.7% Other Liability 2,736,790 2.9% 2,967,804 2.9% 3,592,719 4.1% Other 255,149 0.3% 188,446 0.2% 198,721 0.2% Total $93,596,117 100.0% $101,914,548 100.0% $87,469,000 100.0% The Company`s consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and related loss adjustment expenses of the insurance company operation. The Company sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date at managements best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and all related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date, for both reported and unreported claims. 24 Analysis of the roll forward of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses The following table provides an analysis of the roll forward of Crusaders losses and loss adjustment expenses, including a reconciliation of the ending balance sheet liability for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year net of reinsurance $76,235,467 $67,349,989 $58,883,861 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses Provision for insured events of current year 29,997,662 35,338,196 35,286,172 Decrease in provision for events of prior years (12,170,683) (3,824,464) (835,434) Total losses and loss adjustment expenses 17,826,979 31,513,732 34,450,738 Payments Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the current year 6,728,798 8,001,808 7,438,331 Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years 17,257,218 14,626,446 18,546,279 Total payments 23,986,016 22,628,254 25,984,610 Reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year net of reinsurance 70,076,430 76,235,467 67,349,989 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year 23,519,687 25,679,081 20,119,011 Reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year per balance sheet, gross of reinsurance * $93,596,117 $101,914,548 $87,469,000 * In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts," reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported for GAAP as assets rather than netted against the corresponding liability for such items on the balance sheet. The Companys net loss and loss adjustment expense reserve was $70,076,430 as of December 31, 2006. Since underwriting profit is a significant part of income, a small percentage change in reserve estimates may result in a substantial effect on future reported earnings. Such changes might result from a variety of factors, including claims costs emerging in a different pattern than the average historical development patterns. Considering the continuum of possible development patterns, none of which is necessarily more or less likely than the next, one must consider the varying probabilities that the development pattern is off in varying degrees. If future development ultimately ends up being five percent different than the Companys 2006 reserve, approximately $3.5 million would be reflected in future periods as an increase or decrease in the provision for events of prior years and would be recognized in the Companys consolidated statement of operations in future periods. A variance of five percent of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is not an unlikely scenario. Similarly, a variance of ten percent of the Companys 2006 reserves would be reflected in approximately $7.1 million in future periods as an increase or decrease in the provision for events of prior years and would be recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of operations in future periods. This is also not an unlikely scenario. Differences of more than ten percent are also possible, though not quite as likely as differences of ten percent or less. Other Insurance Operations Association Operation Membership and fee income from the association program of AAQHC is as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Membership and fee income $300,527 $318,349 $333,470 25 Membership and fee income for the year ended December 31, 2006, decreased $17,822 (6%), compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Membership and fee income for the year ended December 31, 2004, decreased $15,121 (5%), compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. In May 2006, CIGNA HealthCare began offering new small group medical insurance policies in the state of California. Currently, all new CIGNA small group medical insurance policies are written through AIB and all CIGNA small group medical insurance policyholders are members of AAQHC. The new programs are competitively priced and are being actively marketed. Health and Life Insurance Program Commission income from the health and life insurance sales is as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Commission income $1,634,438 $1,628,061 $2,156,924 AIB markets health and life insurance in California through non affiliated insurance companies for individuals and groups. For these services, AIB receives commission based on the premiums that it writes. Commission income remained relatively comparable in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. Commission income decreased $528,863 (25%) in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 2004. The decrease in commission in 2005 was primarily due to the discontinuance of CIGNAs individual and family health insurance program in the state of California. Commissions from carriers other than CIGNA for the year ended December 31, 2006, remained relatively comparable to 2005 and 2004. Policy Fee Income Unifax sells and services insurance policies for Crusader. The policy fee charged to the policyholder by Unifax is recognized as income in the consolidated financial statements. Policy fee income of Unifax is as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Policy fee income $2,638,985 $3,001,966 $3,394,783 Policies issued 15,186 17,927 20,885 Policy fee income for the year ended December 31, 2006, decreased $362,981 (12%) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The 12% decrease in policy fee income is primarily a result of a 2,741 (15%) decrease in the number of policies issued during 2006 as compared to 2005, offset by the increase in policy fee from $165 per policy to $178 per policy effective on and after August 2005. Policy fee income for the year ended December 31, 2005, decreased $392,817 (12%) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The 12% decrease in policy fee income is primarily a result of a 2,958 (14%) decrease in the number of policies issued during 2005 as compared to 2004 offset, by the increase in policy fee from $165 per policy to $178 per policy effective on and after August 2005. Daily Automobile Rental Insurance Program The daily automobile rental insurance program is produced by Bedford. Bedford receives a commission from a non affiliated insurance company based on premium written. Prior to December 31, 2003, Bedford also received a claim administration fee from the non affiliated insurance company. Commission and fee income from the daily automobile rental insurance program are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Rental program commission $317,679 $411,189 $555,964 Contingent commission 53,638 29,877 9,488 Total commission 371,317 441,066 565,452 Claim administration fee 4,035 70,000 Total commission and fee income $375,352 $511,066 $565,452 26 The daily automobile rental insurance program commission and fee income decreased $135,714 (27%) from $511,066 in 2005 to $375,352 in 2006. Commission and fee income decreased $54,386 (10%) from $565,452 in 2004 to $511,066 in 2005. The daily automobile rental insurance program commission and fee income excluding claim administration fee and contingent commission decreased $93,510 (23%) from $411,189 in 2005 to $317,679 in 2006. Commission and fee income excluding claim administration fee and contingent commission decreased $144,775 (26%) from $555,964 in 2004 to $411,189 in 2005. Premium written in 2006 decreased 25% compared to premium written in 2005, and premium written in 2005 decreased 24% compared to premium written in 2004. The decrease in written premium in 2006 and 2005 is primarily due to the continued intense price competition in the daily automobile rental insurance program, which is causing these reductions in the Companys written premium and related commission income. The Company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue, nor in which direction they might change. To avoid underwriting losses for the non affiliated insurance Company that it represents, Bedford continues to produce business only at rates that it believes to be adequate. Primarily due to declining sales, in April 2006 Bedford hired a new general manager who has substantial experience in the daily automobile rental insurance business. Future sales growth of the Bedford program is also currently dependent on the non affiliated insurance company approving and implementing various product enhancements that Bedford recommends. Bedford is currently working with the non affiliated insurance company to obtain their approval of the recommended program enhancements. The Companys subsidiary U.S. Risk Managers, Inc., (U.S. Risk) ceased providing insurance claim administration services to the non affiliated daily automobile insurer as of December 31, 2003; and it is currently inactive. As of December 31, 2003, the non affiliated insurer assumed the claim administration responsibility for all outstanding and IBNR claims. During 2003, the Company recognized $200,000 of claim administration fees that were unearned as of December 31, 2002. Although U.S. Risk is inactive, the Company is still responsible for all claim administration cost arising from losses covered by premiums for which it received a claim administration fee. During 2004 and 2005, the Company did not receive any claim administration fees and did not incur any future internal claim administration costs. During 2005, the Company recognized an additional amount of $70,000 of the $100,000 claim administration fees that were unearned as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2006, the non affiliated insurer had billed the Company for the final claim administration costs due and the Company recognized the remaining balance in the amount of $4,035 as a claim administration fee income. Other Commission and Fee Income Other commission and fee income are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Earthquake program commission income $37,914 $48,519 $53,140 Miscellaneous commission and fee income 116 70 111 Total other commission and fee income $38,030 $48,589 $53,251 Unifax began producing commercial earthquake insurance policies in California for non affiliated insurance companies in 1999. Unifax receives a commission from these insurance companies based on premium written. Commission income on the earthquake program for the year ended December 31, 2006, decreased $10,605 (22%) compared to 2005. Commission income on the earthquake program for the year ended December 31, 2005, decreased $4,621 (9%) compared to 2004. The commissions paid by Crusader to Unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected in commission income or commission expense. Premium Finance Program Premium finance charges and late fees earned from financing policies are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Premium finance charges and fees earned $678,740 $758,325 $933,529 New loans 3,596 4,200 5,156 27 AAC provides premium financing for Crusader policies produced by Unifax in California. The growth of this program is dependent and directly related to the growth of Crusaders written premium and AACs ability to market its competitive rates and service. Premium finance charges and fees earned decreased $79,585 (10%) in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005 due primarily to the fact that there were 604 (14%) fewer loans financed in the current year. Premium finance charges and fees earned decreased $175,204 (19%) in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 2004 due primarily to the fact that there were 956 (19%) fewer loans financed in the current year. During 2006, 32% of all Unifax policies were financed and 75% of those policies were financed by AAC. During 2005, 32% of all Unifax policies were financed and 75% of those policies were financed by AAC. Investment Income and Net Realized Gains Investment income and net realized gains are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Average Invested Assets at amortized cost $143,957,963 $136,355,683 $125,331,342 Interest income Insurance company operations $5,906,079 $4,248,399 $4,204,573 Other operations 100,955 68,828 38,250 Total investment income and realized gains $6,007,034 $4,317,227 $4,242,823 Yield on Average Invested Assets 4.17% 3.17% 3.39% In the year ended December 31, 2006, while the Companys average invested assets (at amortized value) increased $7,602,280 (6%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, investment income earned increased $1,689,807 (39%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The yield on average invested assets increased to 4.17% in 2006 from 3.17% in 2005. The increase in the yield on average invested assets is primarily the result of an increase in the average return on new and reinvested assets in the Companys investment portfolio. Due to the current interest rate environment, management believes it prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with relatively short maturity duration. Thus, the weighted average maturity of the Companys fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2006 was 1.3 years compared to 1.2 years as of December 31, 2005. The Companys average invested assets increased in the year ending December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of increased cash flows from operations. The mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in the portfolio affects the investment income return percentage. Tax exempt securities generally carry a lower yield than taxable securities. These securities (at amortized value) decreased to $15,134 (0% of total investments) at December 31, 2006, compared to $934,536 (1% of total investments) at December 31, 2005. In the year ended December 31, 2005, while the Companys average invested assets (at amortized value) increased $11,024,341 (9%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, investment income earned increased $74,404 (2%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The yield on average invested assets decreased to 3.17% in 2005 from 3.39% in 2004. The decrease in the yield on average invested assets is primarily the result of a decline in the average return on new and reinvested assets in the Companys investment portfolio. Also contributing to the decline in the yield on average invested assets is a shorter weighted average maturity of new and reinvested assets. Due to the 2005 interest rate environment, management believes it prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with shorter maturities, and therefore, the weighted average maturity of the Companys fixed maturity investments has decreased to 1.2 years as of December 31, 2005, from 1.4 years as of December 31, 2004. The Companys average invested assets increased in the year ending December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of increased cash flows from operations. The mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in the portfolio affects the investment income return percentage. These securities (at amortized value) decreased to $934,536 (1% of total investments) at December 31, 2005, compared to $970,343 (1% of total investments) at December 31, 2004. The par value, amortized cost, estimated market value and weighted average yield of fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2006, by contractual maturity are as follows. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties. 28 Weighted Maturities by Calendar Year Par Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Average Yield December 31, 2007 $70,275,000 $70,219,895 $69,923,874 4.16% December 31, 2008 49,360,000 49,348,028 49,294,401 4.85% December 31, 2009 13,500,000 13,593,098 13,646,589 5.07% December 31, 2010 100,000 100,000 100,000 4.11% December 31, 2011 7,250,000 7,231,307 7,200,078 4.61% Total $140,485,000 $140,492,328 $140,164,942 4.52% The following table sets forth the composition of the investment portfolio of the Company at the dates indicated: (Amounts in Thousands) As of December 31 2006 2005 2004 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Type of Security Cost Value Cost Value Cost Value Certificates of deposit $400 $400 $500 $500 $500 $500 U.S. treasury securities 127,554 127,192 107,291 106,563 77,766 77,299 U.S. government sponsored enterprise securities 6,000 5,933 11,999 11,853 Industrial and miscellaneous taxable bonds 12,523 12,558 21,403 21,631 37,755 38,950 State and municipal tax exempt bonds 15 15 934 922 970 958 Total fixed maturity investments 140,492 140,165 136,128 135,549 128,990 129,560 Short term cash investments 6,820 6,820 4,475 4,475 3,118 3,118 Total investments $147,312 $146,985 $140,603 $140,024 $132,108 $132,678 The following table summarizes, for all fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2006, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time those fixed maturities have been continuously in an unrealized loss. No securities were sold at a loss during 2006, 2005, or 2004. Amortized Gross Cost Fair Value Unrealized Loss 0 6 months $17,464,974 $17,406,777 $58,197 7 12 months 27,040,360 26,931,181 109,179 Over 12 months 57,120,330 56,813,213 307,117 Total $101,625,664 $101,151,171 $474,493 At December 31, 2006, the fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss for continuous periods of 0 to 6 months consisted of U.S. treasury securities. The fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss position for continuous periods of 7 to 12 months consisted both U.S. treasury securities and investment grade industrial securities. The fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss position for a continuous period over 12 months consisted of U.S. treasury securities, investment grade industrial securities and pre refunded municipal bonds. The unrealized loss is primarily due to rising interest rates. The Company monitors its investments closely. If an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary, it is written off as a realized loss through the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Companys methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer, whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments, and the Companys intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow the Company to recover its costs. The Company has concluded that the gross unrealized losses of $474,493 at December 31, 2006, were temporary in nature. However, facts and circumstances may change which could result in a decline in market value considered to be other than temporary. The Company sold one fixed maturity investment in the year ended December 31, 2006, with net 29 realized gain in the amount of $2,617. The Company did not sell any fixed maturity investment in the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating Expenses POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Policy acquisition costs $9,250,989 $10,512,688 $10,319,186 Ratio to net earned premium (GAAP ratio) 22% 21% 21% Policy acquisition costs consist of commissions, premium taxes, inspection fees, and certain other underwriting costs that are directly related to and vary with the production of Crusader insurance policies. These costs include both Crusader expenses and allocated expenses of other Unico subsidiaries. On certain reinsurance treaties, Crusader receives a ceding commission from its reinsurer that represents a reimbursement of the acquisition costs related to the premium ceded. No ceding commission is received on facultative, catastrophe, or provisionally rated ceded premium. Policy acquisition costs, net of ceding commission, are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned. No significant change in the ratio of policy acquisition cost to net earned premium was noted for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Total salaries and employee benefits incurred $9,913,740 $9,401,757 $9,126,929 Less: charged to losses and loss adjustment expenses (1,320,508) (1,387,198) (1,335,778) Less: capitalized to policy acquisition costs (2,731,683) (2,873,586) (2,921,985) Net amount charged to operating expenses $5,861,549 $5,140,973 $4,869,166 Total salaries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased $511,983 (5%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Factors that affected the 5% increase were primarily general salary increases and increases in employee benefits costs. Total salaries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased $274,828 (3%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Factors that affected the 3% increase were general salary increases and increases in employee benefits costs, offset by reduction in the number of employees. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS/BROKERS are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Commission to agents/brokers $611,200 $674,674 $934,452 Commissions to agents/brokers (not including commissions on Crusader policies that are reflected in policy acquisition costs) are generally related to gross commission income from the health and life insurance program, the daily automobile rental insurance program, and the earthquake program. Commissions to agents and brokers decreased $63,474 (9%) for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Commissions to agents and brokers decreased $259,778 (28%) for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The decreases in both years are primarily the result of a decrease in premiums written and the related decrease in the commission expense in the health and life insurance program and the daily automobile rental insurance program. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES are as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Other operating expenses $3,012,678 $2,874,025 $2,657,310 30 Other operating expenses generally do not change significantly with changes in production. This is true for both increases and decreases in production. Other operating expenses increased $138,653 (5%) for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating expenses increased $216,715 (8%) for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $6,359,745 compared to an income tax expense of $3,751,426 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The effective combined income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 35% and 36%, respectively. The pre tax income increased $7,687,556 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, which resulted in an increased income tax expense in 2006. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $3,751,426 compared to an income tax expense of $2,990,958 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The effective combined income tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were 36% and 34%, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $287,000 resulting from an assessment for the years 1999 and 2000 from the California Franchise Tax Board. The assessment resulted from a court ruling in Ceridian vs. Franchise Tax Board that held that the California statute permitting the tax deductibility of dividends received from a wholly owned insurance subsidiary was unconstitutional because it discriminated against out of state holding companies and thus was in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution. The ruling concluded that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute was invalid and unenforceable. California law provides that the proper remedy in such circumstances is to disallow the deduction to those taxpayers that benefited from the deduction. As a result of the court ruling, in February 2003, the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) notified the Company that it would issue a Notice of Proposed Assessment (NPA) for tax years 1999 and 2000 of approximately $287,000 representing California state franchise taxes plus related interest of approximately $80,000. In September 2004, California enacted legislation (AB 263) that addresses many aspects of the tax treatment of insurance company owners, including holding companies such as Unico. The legislation provides for an election, applicable if made to all tax years ending after December 1, 1997, and before January 1, 2005, under which a dividend received deduction of up to 80% of dividends paid by an insurer to a non insurer parent is allowed. In 2004, the Company made the election authorized by AB 263 and, therefore, has reversed 80% of the $287,000 income tax expense and 80% of the interest accrued thereon. In addition, as a result of AB 263, the Company is obligated to establish a state deferred tax liability which represents the Companys future state tax liability for all undistributed earnings of Crusader since January 1, 1993, in accordance with FASB 109. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This interpretation will be effective January 1, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the effect of implementing FIN 48, and does not expect any material impact from the implementation of FIN 48. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measures" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS 157 to determine the impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements by using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to determine whether financial statement restatement is necessary. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The Companys adoption of SAB 108 did not have an effect on its results of operations or financial positions. 31 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"). SFAS 158 requires a business entity that sponsors an employer defined benefit plan to measure plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position and recognize funded status as a component of other comprehensive income. SFAS 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. There is no impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements from adoption of this standard since the Company does not provide a defined benefit plan to its employees. In October 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") issued Statement of Position 05 1, "Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts" ("SOP 05 1"). SOP 05 1 provides accounting guidance for deferred policy acquisition costs associated with internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those already described in SFAS No. 97, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments." SOP 05 1 defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. The provisions of SOP 05 1 are effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SOP 05 1 on its results of operations and financial position. The Company does not expect the impact of the adoption to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position. There were no other accounting standards issued during 2006 that are expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Significant Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates, actual results could differ. Management believes the Companys current critical accounting policies comprise the following: Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires judgments and estimates. The most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60 (SFAS No. 60), "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (SFAS No. 5), "Accounting for Contingencies." Management makes its best estimate of the liability for unpaid claims costs as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the Companys unpaid claims costs, actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments should be expected to vary, perhaps significantly, from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims. Variability is inherent in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, especially for a small insurer like the Company. For any given line of insurance, accident year, or other group of claims, there is a continuum of possible reserve estimates, each having its own unique degree of propriety or reasonableness. Due to the complexity and nature of the insurance claims process, there are potentially an infinite number of reasonably likely scenarios. The Company does not specifically identify reasonably likely scenarios other than utilizing managements best estimate. In addition to applying the various standard methods to the data, an extensive series of diagnostic tests of the resultant reserve estimates are applied to determine managements best estimate of the unpaid claims liability. Among the statistics reviewed for each accident year are loss and loss adjustment expense development patterns, frequencies (expected claim counts), severities (average cost per claim), loss and loss adjustment expense ratios to premium, and loss adjustment expense ratios to loss. When there is clear evidence that the actual claims costs emerged are different than expected for any prior accident year, the claims cost estimates for that year are revised accordingly. Some lines of insurance are commonly referred to as "long tail" lines because of the extended time required before claims are ultimately settled. Lines of insurance in which claims are settled relatively quickly are called "short tail" lines. It is generally more difficult to estimate loss reserves for long tail lines because of the long 32 period that elapses between the occurrence of a claim and its final disposition and the difficulty of estimating the settlement value of the claim. The Companys short tail lines consist of its property coverages and its long tail lines consist of its liability coverages. However, compared to other long tail liability lines that are not underwritten by the Company, such as workers compensation, professional liability, umbrella liability, and medical malpractice, the Companys liability claims tend to be settled relatively quicker. The Company underwrites four statutory annual statement lines of business: (1) commercial multiple peril, (2) liability other than automobile and products, (3) fire, and (4) allied lines. Commercial multiple peril policies comprised 97% of the Companys 2006 and 2005 premium volume. Commercial multiple peril policies include both property and liability coverages. For all of the Companys coverages and lines of business, the Companys actuarial loss and loss adjustment expense reserving methods require assumptions that can be grouped into two key categories: (1) expected loss and loss adjustment expense, required by the expected loss ratio and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, and (2) expected development patterns, required by the loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods. The Company also segregates most of its business into smaller homogeneous categories primarily for managements internal detailed business review and analysis. These homogeneous categories used by the Company include various combinations and special groupings of its lines of business, programs types, states, and coverages. Some categories exclude certain items and or others include certain items. Not all categories are defined in the same way. This analysis includes the tracking of historical claims costs and development patterns separately for each of these uniquely designed categories. Generally, neither the liability development patterns nor the property development patterns vary significantly by category. The accurate establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is a difficult process, as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the reserve that is needed. Estimates are based on a variety of industry data and on the Companys current and historical accident year claims data, including but not limited to reported claim counts, open claim counts, closed claim counts, closed claim counts with payments, paid losses, paid loss adjustment expenses, case loss reserves, case loss adjustment expense reserves, earned premiums and policy exposures, salvage and subrogation, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid. Many other factors, including changes in reinsurance, changes in pricing, changes in policy forms and coverage, changes in underwriting and risk selection, legislative changes, results of litigation and inflation are also taken into account. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Companys reserves are re evaluated for each accident year (i.e., for all claims incurred within each year) by a committee consisting of the Companys executive vice president, the Companys chief financial officer, and an independent consulting actuary. The Company uses the loss ratio method to estimate ultimate claims costs on the current accident year. The current accident year IBNR reserves are initially determined by multiplying earned premiums for the year by the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, then subtracting the current accident years cumulative incurred (paid plus case reserves) to date. This method is subject to adjustment based upon actual results incurred during the reporting period. This initial IBNR reserve is adjusted as subsequent development of that accident year takes place. The Company also applies several additional standard actuarial methods to the historical claims costs data to estimate its unpaid claims liability for each accident year. The additional standard methods include loss development methods and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, both of which can be applied to paid loss and loss adjustment expense (claims costs), reported incurred (paid plus case reserve) claims costs, and or claim counts. These methodologies do not vary by tail length; however, certain parameters do vary. In particular, loss development factors for short tail property claims are different than for long tail liability claims. Development patterns generally do not tend to change materially over time. Generally, the Company has very little property claim development subsequent to the end of an accident year. Although liability claims may take 10 or more years to fully develop, most of the development occurs in the first five to six years subsequent to the end of the accident year. However, liability claims are substantially developed by two years subsequent to the end of the accident year. Other than the change in the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption discussed above, the Companys reserving methodology assumptions have not changed in the years presented and the only significant effect on the Companys financial statements has resulted from estimated costs being adjusted as actual costs emerge. 33 The Companys actuarially based loss and loss adjustment expense reserve methodology does not include an implicit or explicit provision for uncertainty. Insurance claims costs are inherently uncertain. There is not a precise means of quantifying a provision for uncertainty when determining an appropriate liability for unpaid claims costs. Rather, the potential for claims costs being less than estimated and the potential for claims costs being more than estimated are considered when selecting the parameters to be used in the application of the actuarial methods and when testing the estimates for reasonableness. Management believes that its recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserve makes reasonable provision for its liability for unpaid claims costs. The information that management uses to arrive at its best reserve estimate comes from many sources within the Company, including its accounting, legal, claims, and underwriting departments. Informed managerial judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be. Accordingly, short tail claims, such as property damage claims, tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims. The liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses. Since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made. Management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims, both reported and unreported. The Company must estimate its ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using a very small claim population size. At the beginning of 2006, the Company had 771 open claim files. During 2006, 1,230 new claim files were opened and 1,284 claim files were closed, leaving 717 open claim files at the end of 2006. Due to the small size of the Company and the related small population of claims, the Companys losses and loss adjustment expenses for any accident year can vary significantly from the initial expectations. Due to the small number of claims, changes in claim frequency and or severity can materially affect the Companys reserve estimate. The potential variability from managements best estimate cannot be measured from any meaningful statistical basis due to the numerous uncertainties in the claims reserving process and the small population of claims. At each quarterly review, actual claims costs that emerge are compared with the claims costs that were expected to emerge during that development period. Sometimes the previous claims costs estimates prove to have been too high; sometimes they prove to have been too low. In the case of the Company, the estimates proved to be too high in each of the past three years. The favorable development in 2004 through 2006 underscores the inherent uncertainty in insurance claims costs, especially for a very small insurer. Calendar Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year $76,235,467 $67,349,989 $58,883,861 Net (decrease) in provision for events of prior years $(12,170,683) $(3,824,464) $(835,424) Percent of development to beginning reserves (16.0%) (5.7%) (1.4%) The differences between actual and expected claims costs are typically not due to one specific factor, but a combination of many factors such as the period of time between the initial occurrence and the final settlement of the claim, current and perceived social and economic inflation, and many other economic, legal, political, and social factors. Because of these and other factors, actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments should be expected to vary, perhaps significantly, from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims. Any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made. Management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims, both reported and unreported. Reinsurance The Companys receivable from reinsurers represents an estimate of the amount of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments that will be recoverable from the Companys reinsurers. These estimates are 34 based upon estimates of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses that the Company expects to incur and the portion of those losses that are expected to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of the reinsurance agreements. Given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses, the estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome. The Companys estimate of the amounts receivable from reinsurers is regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available. The Companys assessment of the collectibility of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers is based primarily upon public financial statements and rating agency data. Any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations. We evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at their inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature. At December 31, 2006, all such ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance. The following tables provide the effect of reinsurance on the Companys financial statements: The effect of ceded reinsurance on financial position is as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred on excess of loss treaties* Ceded paid losses and loss adjustment expenses $5,148,736 $6,828,051 $5,121,775 Change in ceded case loss reserves (959,394) 2,160,070 (1,336,218) Change in ceded IBNR reserves (1,200,000) 3,400,000 2,200,000 Total ceded losses incurred $2,989,342 $12,388,121 $5,985,557 Ceded loss and loss adjusting expense recoverable on excess of loss treaties Ceded case loss and loss adjusting expense reserves recoverable $3,019,687 $3,979,081 $1,819,011 Ceded IBNR reserves recoverable 20,500,000 21,700,000 18,300,000 Total ceded loss and loss adjusting expense reserves recoverable $23,519,687 $25,679,081 $20,119,011 *There were no catastrophe losses incurred during the period covered by this table. The effect of ceded reinsurance on results of operations is as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Direct earned premium $56,692,213 $64,712,764 $67,890,808 Earned ceded premium Excess of loss treaty premium 12,668,766 13,448,281 17,210,476 Catastrophe treaty premium 1,156,295 833,529 633,329 Other (66,637) (46,966) (59,565) Total earned ceded premium 13,758,424 14,234,844 17,784,240 Ceding commission 4,376,474 4,647,748 6,031,987 Earned ceded premium, net of ceding commission $9,381,950 $9,587,096 $11,752,253 The effect of ceded reinsurance on cash flow is as follows: Year ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Changes in reinsurance recoverable from statements of cash flows $3,602,749 $(7,253,268) $(259,330) The Companys reinsurance strategy is to reduce volatility in its expected loss and loss adjustment expense results by protecting the Company against liabilities in excess of certain retentions, including major or 35 catastrophic losses that may occur from any one or more of the property and or casualty risks which it insures. On an annual basis, or sooner if warranted, the Company evaluates whether any changes to its retention, participation, or retained limits are necessary. The most significant change to the Companys reinsurance program during the three years ended December 31, 2006, was increasing its catastrophic reinsurance in 2005 from $15 million to $35 million. The Company currently only writes business in the state of California. The types of businesses and the coverage limits written by the Company are not considered difficult lines for obtaining reinsurance. In addition, because the major catastrophe exposure is primarily from riots and fire following earthquakes, the Company does not anticipate significant limitations on its ability to cede future losses on a basis consistent with its historical results. Investments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," the Company is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one of three categories: held to maturity, available for sale or trading securities. The Companys fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are stated at market value. Although all of the Companys investments are classified as available for sale and the Company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions, its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity. Short term investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Investments in equity securities are carried at market value. The unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities and equity securities are reported as "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)," which is a separate component of stockholders equity, net of any deferred tax effect. When a decline in value of a fixed maturity or equity security is considered other than temporary, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the specific identification method. Related Party Transactions The Company presently occupies a 46,000 square foot office building located at 23251 Mulholland Drive, Woodland Hills, California, under a master lease expiring March 31, 2012. Erwin Cheldin, the Companys president, chairman, and principal stockholder, is the owner of the building. The Company signed an extension to the lease with a 4% increase in rent effective April 1, 2007. The lease provides for an annual gross rent of $1,025,952 through March 31, 2007 and $1,066,990 from April 1, 2007 through March 31, 2012. In addition, the lease extension provides for two five year options with a rent increase of 5% for each option period. The Company believes that at the inception of the lease agreement and at each subsequent extension, the terms of the lease were at least as favorable to the Company as could have been obtained from non affiliated third parties. The Company utilizes for its own operations approximately 100% of the space it leases. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained herein, including the sections entitled "Business," "Legal Proceedings" and "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," that are not historical facts are forward looking. These statements, which may be identified by forward looking words or phrases such as "anticipate," "appears," "believe," "estimates," "expect," "intend," "may," "should," and "would," involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially include those described under Item 1 "Business Competition" and Item 1A "Risk Factors"; premium rate adequacy relating to competition or regulation; actual versus estimated claim experience; the outcome of rate change filings with regulatory authorities; acceptance by insureds of rate changes; adequacy of rate changes; changes in Crusaders A.M. Best rating; regulatory changes or developments; the outcome of regulatory proceedings; unforeseen calamities; general market conditions; and the Companys ability to introduce new profitable products. 36 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk. The Companys invested assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 consisted of the following: 2006 2005 Fixed maturity bonds (at amortized cost) $140,092,328 $135,628,428 Short term cash investments (at cost) 6,820,007 4,475,162 Certificates of deposit over 1 year (at cost) 400,000 500,000 Total invested assets $147,312,335 $140,603,590 The Companys interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio. As market interest rates decrease, the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments. In addition, the longer the maturity, the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations. The Company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years. In addition, although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale, the Companys investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity. Because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity, the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements is unrealized and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as separate components of stockholders equity, net of any deferred tax effect. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys unrealized losses (net of unrealized gains) before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio were $327,386 compared to unrealized losses (net of unrealized gains) before income taxes of $579,128 as of December 31, 2005. Given a hypothetical parallel increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio as of December 31, 2006, would decrease by approximately $1,694,000. This decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities were sold. The Companys short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk. 37
